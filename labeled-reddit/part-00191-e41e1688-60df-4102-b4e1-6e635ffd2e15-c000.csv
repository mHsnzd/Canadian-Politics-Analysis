it doesn't impact the most influential religions at all, because their religious symbols are so normalized that they're somehow safe (eg: a wedding ring, wearing green on st. patrick's day, and so on).

if quebec wanted to compel restitution from the catholic church for its wrongs, i think you'd see a lot of national support. but this law does nothing to the powerful. it only harms visible minorities.",conservatives

par contre, d’abord, personne ou presque n’a de réaction quand on se faire dire de speak white. je suis heureux que tu sembles ne pas aimer ça, mais c’est absolument ignoré par la majorité des canadiens anglais. 

tu vois toronto comme un bastion immigrant. c’est vrai, mais ce n’est pas tout, comme moi qui voit le québec comme une place accueillante. 

si tu ne vois pas comment ça peut mal paraître que de riches anglophones qui ne vivent même pas dans la province tente de décider pour les québécois en clamant haut et fort leur supériorité morale, c’est peut-être parce qu’il manque une — immense — partie du puzzle. 

une immense partie de la très vielle et très contemporaine haine contre les francophones s’est exprimée du même type: les francophones forment un peuple arriéré et intolérant qui ne mérite que d’être assimilé. ça te dit quelque chose? pour la majorité des canadiens anglais, ça ne veut dire ces paroles, pourtant c’est une des pierres fondatrices de notre canada. 

quand des riches et puissants du canada anglais se chargent d’attaquer le québec, ça ne va jamais bien réagir ici.

de plus, comme mentionné par presque tous les combattants de la loi, ces charges sont presque toujours faites au détriment de ceux qui se battent contre elle au québec.

quand même des fous comme andré pratte mentionne que c’est une mauvaise idée, quand même emilie nicholas dit que ce genre de comportements fait souvent beaucoup plus de tort que de bien, quand le partie qui mène la bataille de front contre la loi le dit, mais que des puissants qui n’ont jamais fait partie de notre culture s’empresse d’utiliser des fonds publics pour encourager des groupes qui eux-mêmes sont souvent basés en dehors de la province, ça joue dans les comportements traditionnels des orangistes et francophobes de tous acabits.

les gens devraient se fâcher. ils ont le droit.

mais si tu ne vois pas cette nuance, c’est que tu ne considères pas une information cruciale dans notre histoire nationale.

si qs le dit comme ça, c’est qu’ils savent exactement ce que ça va faire: ça va rendre la loi 21 un principe de base de la lutte contre la francophobie, alors que ce ne l’est pas. trudeau le sait aussi.

la seule façon de se débarrasser de cette loi, c’est de se débarrasser de legault.

this is really a point i'm not seeing being made enough.

in the hierarchy of fucks given, bill 21 is relatively low in quebec, yes, even with its majority democratic support. it's seen as a \"compromise\" avec the decades of discussions out of the bouchard-taylor commission. it's not something most people really cling to. it's seen electorally as  \"plus\" for the caq mostly because they are the party who finally put an end on the debate, not because of the policy.

but the not-withstanding clause? that's a huge third rail. quebec would go nuclear from any federal attempt to change it. it would be seen as existential issue, a much much bigger deal than bill 21, and no quebec provincial party would ever support it.

the age of conquest is over, modern empire isn't built on miltaries anymore, its built on hegemony. selling entertainment, fun gadgets, stitching production streams together between disparate legal frameworks and keeping governments off the producers' backs with just enough compliance to make bureaucrats go away. might isn't the means to prosperity anymore, it's intellectual property, so to speak. (not at all to imply that militaries or soldiers are stupid, never at all intend that)

now, it's really hard to quantify the value of militaries without being in a war that benefits the countries who prosecute it. without an invading army to defend against it's really hard to justify the costs. canada isn't any kind of empire and it never way so of course military budgets are hard to sell. canada buys its peace with international aid, not with soldiers.

of course it neglects its military, it hasn't had a reason not to since 1953 when it finally extricated itself from the nonsense of the korean war. afghanistan was a terrific effort to justify because the dividends to canada were limited to- if canada gets involved america won't be mad at it.

people still need to watch the barricades, so to speak, but canada's friends with (nearly) everyone. when alberta had its terrible forest fires even russia offered help at its expense (which trudeau declined, probably wisely). it's hyper easy to grow complacent, and think all you need to do to stay safe is keep selling quality goods to buyers.

i'm rambling, but i guess what it comes down to is canada already has budget problems, and i personally prefer minimum tax rates and i think people tend to agree with me. where they don't, they usually mean someone else's taxes. so i don't think there's a way to square that circle.",liberals

&gt; for canada, guilbeault said nuclear will have to compete alongside technologies like wind and solar, which are becoming the least expensive types of power available.

&gt; “it’s not up to the government to decide which of these technologies will thrive. it’s going to be up to the market,” he said to reporters in glasgow.

how is that controversial? the federal government does not and should not be micromanaging the choices of actual power generating companies across the country. the government is funding the development projects which are necessary to get some viable nuclear proposals, but there is no need to force those proposals into production for a market that doesn't want to use them. if they did then i would expect natpo to have op-eds actually screaming about how the liberals are interfering in the energy market, causing problems with \"unproven\" and \"uneconomic\" nuclear projects (both being real risks for the new-generation smrs).

why didn't natpo use a quote from this bit for their title?

&gt; natural resources minister jonathan wilkinson said the government is supporting early projects, but they will have to prove themselves.

&gt; “we have supported the development work. and certainly i look forward to seeing what that looks like when they are demonstrated at scale and when we actually have a sense of what the commercial economics of those systems will be.”

no, what happened was the liberals had a weak leader (former pc health minister raj sherman), and about 2/3 of their voters defected to the pcs to stop the far-right wildrose from winning in 2012. that left the liberals with 2 seats in edmonton, and 3 in calgary. so at that point, the party's at its worst shape in years, and the pcs have taken over as the moderate/centre-left party. indeed, one of the most prominent members of the liberals even moved to the pcs for a cabinet spot.

two of those calgary mps then decided to run for the federal party in the 2015 federal election (they both won), meaning those seats lacked strong incumbents. then, a few months before the 2015 election, raj sherman announces he wasn't running for re-election. that meant his edmonton-area seat was now open, and the liberals headed into the election with an interm leader (david swann) and only two seats--one in downtown edmonton, and one in downtown calgary.

so in 2015, the liberals were a broken, dysfunctional shell of a party after 4 years of poor leadership, a horrible election, and a lot of defections to the pcs. and the wildrose was in a similar boat--half their caucus, including their leader, danielle smith, had defected to the pcs a few months before the 2015 election, leaving that party a confused mess.

that meant that when the public was looking for an alternative to the pcs, they skipped over the liberals and the wildrose, and went to the ndp, who appeared to have more of their shit together. only one liberal, leader david swann, ended up winning a seat, and in 2019, when he decided to retire, the liberals basically stopped existing as a serious party.",liberals

air canada used to be a crown corp but it was privatized in the late 80s. as part of that there were certain legal stipulations in what is commonly known as the air canada act that mandated certain things such as the hq being in montreal and certain maintenance being done in certain places, etc.

this was done because it wasn't politically prudent to allow what was originally a government entity to close up shop and move from one region another, as that would obviously piss off voters in said region. especially when that region was quebec. also, when it was first privatized the government still had the majority of the shares, so it kinda made sense to have some federal interference since there was government money at play.

what should have happened was the moment the airline was fully privatized (i.e. all shares were sold) the air canada act should have been rendered dead. or as a second chance it should have killed when air canada went bankrupt.
