i think it's fair to say that o'toole is already following points 1 and 2. in his very first press conference after winning the leadership (in part by appealing to social conservatives who were unhappy with mackay, calling himself the \"true blue candidate\"), o'toole described himself as a [pro-choice conservative mp](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/erin-otoole-conservative-leadership-pro-choice-lgbtq_ca_5f45652fc5b697186e2dc577), and promised to defend lgbtq rights. and of course he brought in [a climate plan which included a carbon tax](https://twitter.com/russilwvong/status/1383520928475144195?s=19).

of course the tricky thing for o'toole on both fronts is that his party isn't united behind him.

one more element of o'toole's strategy is trying to win support from quebec francophones. not sure how opposition to c-10 will play into this.",conservatives

you build 500 homes, they go up to auction. lets be conservative and say 10% will get picked up by investors. ok so right off the bat you need to build another 50 houses so that everyone who wanted one can buy it. but it doesn't stop there. sure the investors only bought 50 homes, but they put in bids for 250, driving up the prices for those homes too. if investors are removed from the equation we have less demand, and fewer bidders, so prices go down.

flooding the market with homes is not feasible, as you keep pointing out we have been under producing, so there is no reason to think we have the capacity to build thousands more units each year, much less the financial incentives. remember those people building homes are also selling them, and have every incentive to keep housing prices high.",liberals

&gt;  during the nearly three decades since, the policy has been reduced, first in 2013 seeing the lifetime ban knocked down to a five-year deferral period. that meant, rather than outright refusing donations from men who had sex with men, or the ‚Äúmsm‚Äù community as some have coined it, donations would be accepted only if the donor had not been sexually active for five years.

&gt; in 2015, the liberals campaigned on ending the then-five-year ban altogether. at the time, the party stated that the policy \"ignores scientific evidence and must end.‚Äù a year later, the five-year deferral period was reduced to one year.

&gt; then in june 2019, the second reduction in the deferral period under the federal liberals came into effect, seeing the policy allow donations from gay and bisexual men or trans folks who have sex with men, if they‚Äôd been abstinent for three months.

and here's an article from 2016 saying that the research would likely need to run until 2020: https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-blood-ban-gay-men-1.4608769

so while it hasn't been eliminated altogether, it sounds like they're trying to make the change in partnership with cbs in an evidenced-based cautious approach. you could complain that it wasn't eliminated entirely, but sometimes a policy based on political or values butts up against practicality. and regardless of that, clearly they've been working towards that goal as much as possible in a reasonable way from relatively early on.",liberals

i don't claim to know. but that's what the polls and research is turning up. and lets put that in perspective, they are two voters out of approximately 28 million voters. of which about 15-18 million will likely vote. this isn't going to be a leadership contest, this will be a general election. 

so two opinions, or 20 or even 2000 about one issue isn't going to win any elections. 

and lets look at the reality - while he isn't keeping that promise, he's not just out and out breaking it either. trudeau's tax was 50 bucks a tonne now rising to 150 (ish). and he kept the money and maybe gave some back, maybe, if he feels like it.  erin will drop it to 25 bucks (28? whatever) and you get to keep the cash and spend it on something you choose as long as it's environmentally friendly, 

so he said he'd get rid of it - and he's not. but he's reduced it considerably and is making it so you keep the money, because if he doesn't get elected - the 150 is what you'll pay.  that's just the reality of politics sometimes - if he can't win, he can't do anything and the fact is the public supports a price on carbon. that's life in a democracy. 

&gt; it can‚Äôt just be ignored.

it's pretty obvious it wasn't ignored. but neither can the millions who won't vote conservative if they don't have something. so it's a compromise. do what you have to to get elected, do as much as you can to keep your promise 

now - that doesn't mean that the poster can't do much to send the message that he still doesn't like this and would rather have something different. and it doesnt' mean that he can't tell them he's pissed off about it. but - he needs to get real too. if justin wins - he'll pay vastly more and get less. and then there's the other things like the attacks on freedoms and the insane debt and deficit etc etc, 

politics is about compromise and doing what you can. there is no doubt in my mind if erin could just have no carbon pricing he'd do that. but - he'll lose. and we really need to win or we get nothing",liberals

along comes facebook (and its ilk.  this comment could be about youtube or instagram or many other social media giants).  facebook doesn't care about what is true by consensus; facebook cares about engagement.  if you are engaged, you spend more time on facebook and you become a more valuable product to sell to advertisers.

how do you keep people engaged?  you tell them that their beliefs are the truth via an algorithm.  the algorithm may decide that some people want to be shown reality a, and others want to be shown reality b.  only one reality can be true (i.e. aligns the consensus of the majority), but both groups believe theirs is the true reality and the other is delusional.  when this division occurs around truths that have an objective rather than a subjective truth, society fractures.

if people are divided over subjects where there is no subjective truth, such as whether israel or palestine is more to blame for the conflicts in their region, there isn't a problem.  both sides can continue to yell at each other without changing the outcome.  if people are divided over subjects where there is a subjective truth (i.e. a majority consensus), such as whether the policies of a politician are effective at dealing with an issue, there may or may not be a problem depending on the anger of each side leading to radicalization.  divisions like this are touchy yet can still be tolerated with effective moderation removing those calls for radical actions.  however, when people are divided over subjects with an objective truth, such as whether trump or biden won the election and is president of the usa, or whether the covid vaccine is safe and effective or a poison that kills everybody it touches, there's a problem.  there is an absolute 'truth' position that cannot be changed by believing otherwise, just anger, frustration, and radicalization, yet facebook and its ilk treat these issues like any other.  if the algorithm decides that someone is more engaged if they're shown content claiming trump won the election and a secret cabal is keeping him out of the white house, then those people are going to believe that because as far as they're concerned that must be the consensus truth because it's all they ever see.  acting on those beliefs in public will cause a negative reaction, yet because those ideas have been so reinforced as their truth it will just cause anger and resentment rather than the reevaluation of their beliefs.  once somebody absolutely believes those things to be true, how on earth do you ever de-program them?  telling them \"trump lost!\" is akin to somebody telling you \"the sky is purple!\"  you know the sky isn't purple because you see it every day, and everybody you know says the sky is blue, not purple, so those purple-ites must be crazy!  the only way to prevent society from fracturing in this scenario is to prevent those divisions over objective truths in the first place, but if preventing those divisions negatively affects the profits of facebook and its ilk, then we can't rely on their goodwill to fix the issue and government intervention is absolutely required.",liberals
hijao4z,2021-10-29T03:12:43.000-07:00,"in netherlands ahead of g20, trudeau warns disinformation threatens democracy, global economy so, this is a mixed bag thing. public is better at 99% of healthcare issues, the exception is when the bottleneck of a service is due to cost rather than manpower. 

the example i use is mris, xrays, and other similar items. the main limitation in these fields isn't finding employees with the skills, it's the fact that the machines are prohibitively expensive. this is where private can step in to relieve some of the burden by providing a service to those that can pay. this is because when they set up, they aren't taking a skilled doctor out of practice in a hospital where they cannot fill a gap, they are taking a tech. schools that teach these skills can meet this new demand with marginal impact on admissions. as a result, there is a net gain for the healthcare system. 

what cannot happen, is things like offering private services like surgeries where the bottleneck is a lack of skilled practitioners. if we allow a private hospital to pop up, it will be staffed by members of the healthcare system that we cannot replace so the public system suffers. 

the additional issue, which relates to nursing homes, is that private services need to be conditional on continuing to provide a quality service.  private nursing homes have almost universally proven that they completely and utterly fail this criteria. while they are providing a service on top of what the public system can provide, they are doing it extremely poorly and therefore should not be permitted to continue. the solutions are either increasing standards through inspections and regulations, or nationalizing them.",liberals

pr works well in countries like germany (where i am currently living) and new zealand because they are geographically small with a more dense population. they don‚Äôt have the challenge of accommodating extraordinarily vast diversities in the economy, cultures, and environment. pr in canada would leave important rural areas and communities in the dust.

for anyone interested in this topic, i would strongly suggest reading up on australia‚Äôs system. it‚Äôs not without its flaws but would be much better than what we have now.

basically, the house is elected based on preferential ballots, which does push things to the center but i don‚Äôt think this is a bad thing. it also allows smaller parties to make inroads much quicker.

then they have a pr system for the senate. we don‚Äôt even elect our senate in canada which is bs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs assigned and basically serves as nothing more than a hangover from the previous administration.

hdcj6ft,2021-09-18T02:29:42.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected here are a few of my thoughts about what can happen if this gets a lot of attention:

-ppc voters who are very online will see this and think that trudeau is trying to grab power permanently by changing the electoral system to benefit himself. i don't know how those votes change though, they might think that this is their last chance to stop trudeau and switch to cpc.

-lpc/ndp switchers who are very online could see this and it will remind them of the first election promise the liberals made in 2015 was to get rid of fptp.

all that said, i get why trudeau might talk about this because people are concerned about ppc mps getting elected. i just think it's a really bad idea to talk about this! also ranked ballots and pr are not incompatible (stv is an example of both), but trudeau did mention that pr is a bad idea so that can be ruled out by him, but not definitively imo. there could be consensus around a pr ranked ballot hybrid system.",liberals

ranked ballot has a bad habit of entrenching two party states. but if the liberals play their cards right, it could entrench us with a one party state with the ndp and cpc never being able to get close to forming government.

ranked ballots can be even less representative, especially if you don't like your 2nd choice. now stv can be used to keep ranked ballots, but also provide a much more proportionate outcome. now it's pretty obvious the liberals would never push for that. mmpr or stv are the way to go.",liberals

\"and see that by april we had more people with a single dose than the rest of g7\"

i didn't pick the date, you did. just happens that trudeau sucked at procuring vaccines on the date you picked. this definitely contributed to the 3rd wave.

additionally, the 2019 study i linked showed that for individuals who voted liberal, 43% would put ndp as their second choice. so in competitive ridings, that would lead to more ndp seats would it not?

how is bill c-10 so important that it is worth pissing off their base to pass it, and pass it without debate, and craft it in secret?

if the job demands that people be able to leave their political and religious opinions at the door when on the job, it is reasonable to question whether a person is truly capable of being neutral if their ideology is so strong that they feel they cannot remove a simple piece of cloth.  a piece of cloth that isn't actually mandated by the religion.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;a person should be judged on how they do their job, not on whether they are religious or not.

but can they do the job effectively if they can't disassociate themselves from their personal worldview?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;there is simply no reason to assume that a woman wearing a hijab is a threat to you.

i don't think anyone is suggesting this.

&amp;#x200b;

agreed.  but this smells like a hyperbolic straw-man.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;before politicians take away a person's charter right to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, they need to prove conclusively that it threatens the public. legault has yet to explain how muslim teachers wearing a hijab threatens children more than his suspension of charter rights threatens  muslims, jews, and  sikhs.

this has been covered elsewhere in this thread: in the case of teachers, they must remain neutral on religious and political fronts because they are an authority figure.  this isn't a question of threat.  it's a question of influence on young minds.  would you be down with teachers wearing any kind of political messaging to class?  i think the question is where to draw the line.  why allow certain displays of ideology but not others?",liberals

je trouve que √ßa a vraiment d√©t√©rior√© dans la derni√®re d√©cennie. en 2011, on pouvait toujours critiquer la place de la religion dans notre soci√©t√© et les pratiques religieuses sans se faire vilipender. en 2021, la moindre mise en question cause des explosions m√©diatiques. 

je crois qu'il y a eu un point tournant lors de la campagne √©lectorale de 2015. depuis que harper &amp; le pcc ont pris la d√©cision de s'attaquer aux \"pratiques culturelles barbares\" avec une ligne d'assistance inutile (le 911 existe) dans la campagne dans le but de faire du capital politique, tout autre d√©bat politique touchant moindrement la religion est vu du m√™me angle anti-musulman. pourtant, une majorit√© claire d'environ 90% s'oppose toujours au niqab, par exemple, et la question d'exemption religieuse se pose. 

dans un univers alternatif o√π harper ne touche pas √† ces questions en campagne √©lectorale et mulcair reste en t√™te et d√©croche une minorit√© (au minimum), je me demande o√π on en serait aujourd'hui.  parce que m√™me si mulcair est pour les exemptions religieuses, il n'y aurait sans doute pas le m√™me climat m√©diatique (ou m√™me politique) sur ces questions.

i am born and raised in ontario, so i have a pretty good idea of how bad it is right now because i have been here the entire pandemic.... its hitting the entire province hard, but especially toronto. 

what i do not get is how everyone who is arguing for him to go does not seem to see that they are also exhibiting a very clear lack of personal responsibility.... its like you are blaming him for everything that's wrong right now and completely ignoring that a vast majority of people don't care and don't take it serious, never wear a mask and belive all the conspiracy shit... or a combination of some of those. regardless, those people kept shopping, making excuses to go out for dinner or to a secret party \"because nobody will know and what will it hurt\" all of that is personal responsibility and there is a very clear lack of it from some. 

just to clarify my position here, at the beginning of this pandemic i was not a fan of mr. ford and i was very loud about that. i also very much dislike the conservatives in general. in fairness though,  i have watched him try to be reasonable with people in these press conferences over and over the same message. \"saying he didn't want to impose more restrictions because he felt it was not our way of life and asking people to all do their part like smart people\" 
now everyone is all butt hurt because its all gone to shit but nobody wants to look at the majority who are out in the parks packed together, on the beaches etc.

obviously people will do whatever they want if you just trust them to be good. nobody should be shocked by this and you can blame ford for it but that's a cop out so you don't haveto admit you didn't really try very hard. 

now we have the india variant in ottawa, today india had 315,000 (yes that's the correct number) new cases in one fucking day... thats how fast this new variant moves and its here. we all gotta get our heads in this game or we will loose.

it's also in the states, they found it earlier this month. 5 people with it.

and why am i going on these crazy rants and getting all fired up about this shit all day you wonder? well i'm selfish and i don't feel safe anymore, and i want to feel safe. i'm sick of it. all the people who only care about themselves and wanna watch the world burn are in my opinion the driving cause of this getting worse, not the politicians. people are just numb to it now and that's the scariest part going into what looks to be the worst stage of this pandemic so far.",conservatives

i have no doubt that the process was discussed.

&gt;her majesty likes to keep up to date with what her realms are doing, and while she isn't likely to push for any changes in the process, she might still provide advice.

indeed, but what is the purpose of providing advice (or being consulted) on a process that has completed? the government's own narrative is that the shortlist is ready and that the pm will be making a decision soon. consultation after the fact isn't consultation, it's a briefing.

&gt;i don't see what the problem would be with a second audience. 

no problem at all, provided nobody's time (especially her majesty's) is being wasted. but the unique situation here is that the pm was in the uk and thus available for an official audience with her majesty, rather than a phone call. this circumstance has mattered in terms of the timing of the last two appointments (payette's appointment was announced a week after the pm returned from the uk in 2017 where a visit to edinburgh coincided with an audience at balmoral; johnston's appointment was announced just a couple weeks after the queen's 2010 tour of canada), so the connection is a logical one.

(incidentally, both of those past circumstances included speculation that the pm might have discussed the appointment of a gg, but the government in both instances continued to insist \"no decision has been made yet.\")

&gt;the skulldugery you're suggesting, just doesn't ring true.

i'm not suggesting skullduggery at all, just a bit of spin to frame the narrative. it's a pretty standard comms approach this government uses - make a decision, prime the public and the press for the decision by hinting that one's coming, then make an announcement when the circumstances are right. whether it's a sensible approach or not, it does reflect how the pmo comms folks think. and as i mentioned before, it also provides the government with a bit of flexibility in case something comes up in the vetting stage.

edit: to be clear, i think it‚Äôs entirely believable that the queen wouldn‚Äôt have been asked to ‚Äúsign off‚Äù on a final decision. but it‚Äôd stretch my disbelief a little to far to take it as a given that there was no discussion of any of the names on the shortlist.",liberals

and the government lowered the requirements for immigration this year in order to get even more in. this despite warnings that would lead to declining immigrant economic success. 

*the hard reality is that significantly increasing immigration in 2021 will have distributional effects ‚Äì there will be winners and losers. to identify the biggest winners, you need only identify the loudest proponents: big business, real estate developers, banks selling mortgages, and immigration law firms. but waiving crs standards for the sake of hitting ambitious admissions targets will undoubtedly increase competition for scarce low- to medium-skill jobs in those sectors hit hardest by this pandemic.*

yes, exactly. i don't disagree at all. maybe i'm trying to be too clever by half here. the reason i liked the question was *because* it didn't obfuscate or hide behind \"experts say...\" it exposed, perhaps unintentionally, exactly what this debate is about.

the article i referenced had this advice for how kurl should have approached the question.

&gt;the followup question should have then cited reputable authorities who've stated that these laws are discriminatory.

see, that's how people play this game. pretending like this is an issue that can be adjudicated by authorities as opposed to the people of quebec.

they probably wouldn't put it in these terms, but i suspect that opposition parties and people fighting against the bill disliked the question because it moved the terms of the debate into a territory they want to avoid. and that's whether quebec actually is a nation within canada with the right to democratically choose whether secularism is legally enshrined, or whether quebec's status isn't worth the paper it's written on.

english canada, especially the country's academic/media/cultural class, believes the law is discriminatory. they would prefer to convince quebec away from it, but since most are totally incapable of imagining the priorities of french canadians (how often are quebec language laws the butt of jokes) they're more than happy to use legal coercion if convincing fails.

would i prefer that english canada understood and respected quebec as a nation? yes. would i prefer a bit of self-awareness from my fellow english canadians who seem totally capable of understanding indigenous sovereignty when it comes to decisions made by hereditary leadership. yeah that would be great.

but since that's not going to happen i think quebec voters deserved the opportunity to hear what english canada really thinks. even if it came in the form of a less than professional question from the moderator.

a political analyst in quebec [put it well:](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2021/09/18/unacceptable-debate-question-quebec-election-outcome/)

&gt;‚Äúit was a great opportunity for mr. blanchet to score tremendous points, telling the rest of quebecers, ‚Äòsee we‚Äôre not paranoid, we know the rest of canada looks at us differently and we‚Äôre not getting a fair deal with ottawa, and we are your best bet to protect your interest,‚Äô‚Äù said political analyst karim boulos.

that's why i liked the question, because it made the debate about *something true.* which is pretty rare.",conservatives

some guys at snc-lavalin were essentially courting an evil dictator for contracts which is illegal in canada. the individuals were being criminally charged and trudeau went to the minister of justice and essentially said this is ground to revoke the entire companies business license but if we can avoid that we should. that suggestion was a violation of the ethics rules. that's his whole scandal.

as for we, trudeau recommended them for a government contract. he had been working with/for them since he was a teenager so it kinda makes sense he'd recommend them. when there shady practices started coming to light they did not award them the contract and essentially wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole. so his role in that scandal was he suggested a charity that wasn't chosen.

italy was hit early, but most of their deaths happened long after the initial spike in cases (the surge in deaths during late 2020/early 2021 was as bad as spring 2020 in italy). some other countries hit with a similar spike like italy had reacted more effectively. and it's worth noting that south korea also had an early surge in cases and seemed to do well. as it happened the us very likely had a surge in cases in february, but was flying blind because of their incredible [failures in testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html) (the cdc designed a test that was flawed, and then took a long time to develop a working alternative, while also trying to shut down scientists who were ringing the alarm bells). 

you're right that there are tradeoffs between preventing deaths and other objectives in some respects. some of the stricter lockdown approaches certainly disrupted ordinary life. but there are other measures - like mask-wearing - that can offer protection without disrupting economic activity. where governments offered people and businesses financial support, i think that went a long way to both shoring up a weak economy and preventing deaths. and to some extent the pressure on business is a result of the virus itself and not just government policy. even if everything was opened up, many people would be afraid to go about their everyday lives. economically the g-7 country that fared the worst was britain, which also initially pursued a light-touch approach to the pandemic.",liberals

a bigger issue in canada than elsewhere has been the growing share of the central bank‚Äôs holdings of the outstanding bond market. it currently owns a little more than 35 per cent¬†of the total market of outstanding government of canada debt. governor tiff macklem has said that when holdings rise above 50 per cent, market functioning could get distorted.\"

selling bonds is borrowing money and leaves taxpayers on the hook for the yields on those bonds. if you sell them to yourselves, you collect the interest so it's not debt but we also sell them on the market.

the point of quantitative easing is to increase the money supply and this causes inflation. have you seen the price of houses these days? or stocks? or dogs, exercise equipment? the price of a 2x4 has jumped from less than $4 pre-pandemic to $15 now. this is all inflation. we need to pretend it isn't happening for the system to keep functioning but no one who doesn't have a vested interest in there being no inflation believes there is no inflation.",liberals

h21sixw,2021-06-16T13:40:03.000-07:00,"doug ford has joined the attack on the constitution. why won‚Äôt justin trudeau fight back? a couple observations:

&gt;the judiciary is the branch that interprets the law

all branches of the state bear interpretive responsibilities, not just judges. and a lot of judicial ‚Äúinterpretation‚Äù of the law is actually ‚Äúmaking‚Äù of law - a great deal of charter of rights analysis involves making trade-offs between different values systems and philosophical arguments about what kind of society we want to be, all of which is decidedly in the realm of ‚Äúpublic policy making.‚Äù historically, this isn‚Äôt the interpretive role our system gives to the courts, and it is possible for the courts to step over the line. in that regard, s.33 can just as easily be used to *protect* rights in cases where the court gets the balance (against another right) wrong. i‚Äôm not sure if that means a simple parliamentary majority should be all it takes to use s.33, but democratically you have a problem if you get to the point where supermajorities are voting for things that most of the population wants to see and the courts can still stop it.

&gt;previously enacted laws are invalidated new acts of parliament

right, which in our system is normally not possible. the principle of parliamentary sovereignty means that, among other things, previous parliaments can‚Äôt bind future ones. so if parliament passes a law, and a future parliament passes a different law which directly contradicts the older one, the newer one takes precedence. in that sense, parliament becomes the senior constitutional partner, and the focal point of our sovereignty. in the uk, until 2010 that meant that the highest court in the land was itself part of parliament (the judicial committee of the house of lords). *fusion* of powers is as integral to our system as the division of powers, perhaps moreso.

that said, there are benefits to a strong and independent judiciary. they key is to strike the right balance, and reserve key parliamentary rights for times when it matters. is ontario‚Äôa moment right now such a time?",liberals

hjf4f3r,2021-11-05T00:37:20.000-07:00,"that moment when the european union has more abortion regulations than the usa and canada combined. &gt; how is it possible that it's not a crime to kill a healthy fetus week before term by the sole request of the pregnant woman?

because our supreme court has, in its wisdom, decided that our constitution's guarantee of the \"security of the person\" requires us to allow a woman to receive an abortion at any stage of pregnancy for any reason.  because otherwise, she would not have the right to \"choose her own destiny\" (because she would be burdened with a child), which is a violation of this security of the person. 

therefore, there have been no criminal penalties in canada for abortion before the point of birth since 1988, and it would be unconstitutional for the government to pass any.

there are still civil penalties.  so in qu√©bec, provincial regulations say that doctors can't do abortions after 23 weeks.   but the penalty for this is basically a fine, maybe a misdemeanour if the prosecutor doesn't like you, and the doctor could be disqualified from receiving state insurance.  

(the way the government in qu√©bec gets around this is by referring women to abortion providers in vermont, which has no limit on how late abortions can be performed). 

the result is that  in canada, you can never be prosecuted for killing a child before the point of birth.  the woman can be 9 months pregnant, but if the child has not been born, it doesn't matter.   the abortionist will never go to jail. 

the worst part is that mentioning that *maybe* canada should have some abortion laws is the fastest way to destroy your political career.  a woman running for the leadership of the conservative party proposed banning only sex-selective abortions (i.e. you can not kill a baby in the womb because it's a girl).  this was mostly symbolic (there's virtually no way you could ever prove someone had an abortion for sex-based reasons), but people considered this extremely shocking and controversial, and portrayed her as a right-wing christian fundamentalist for suggesting this.

&gt; that's pure butchery. a neonaticide.

oh yes, it is.  but because the defining pathology of canada is \"not america,\" canada must be the opposite of everything america is.  we must be so progressive that americans are shocked and horrified, and this a source of national pride.  so right-wing, evangelical christianity is the most evil thing a canadian can imagine, and so he wants to be the opposite of that.",conservatives
