it's very upsetting. we could have vaccines being made in canada right about now. instead it's just going into trials (at least the gov't is throwing in a small amount of money for that). so it's 2022 before they can finish and get approval and go into full production.",liberals

this should have been the lesson from the harper years. he clamped down hard on his caucus and party leadership to hold the line on issues that were controversial with canadians.  he knew that he couldn't scare moderates.

instead we have the party membership voting against acknowledging climate change and dozens of sitting mps actually touching the third rail of politics with abortion legislation.  yes, i know the excuses and talking points for all that stuff.  but at the end of the day, voters aren't political nerds and don't give a shit.  those are the headlines they will see.  disciplined parties know this and never let such motions reach the floor in parliament, or allow such motions in a convention (without a confirmed count in the background).

this is all ramping up the abc vote and scaring progressives right back into the liberal fold, away from the ndp and greens.  the liberals are campaigning substantially on the left because they don't fear the cpc taking the centre at all.  they are actually more worried about losing votes on the left.  ironically, if the cpc was closer to the centre, the liberals would be campaigning closer to the centre too.",liberals

h5pm006,2021-07-18T13:10:59.000-07:00,"nova scotia ndp promises major social supports if they form government - leader gary burrill says rent control, $15/hr minimum wage, sick pay all to be immediate priorities &gt;rent control is a well known economist nightmare of a policy. decreases supply, and so harms everyone except those lucky enough to get in under the scheme (i.e. usually those who are privileged under some dimension - either long time residents, or those who are politically connected or willing to do other things to jump the queue...)

\"rent control is terrible\" is probably one of the most harmful truisms in contemporary society, perhaps because price-capped rent control is used as an econ 101 example of how price ceilings can distort markets (which nyc did with mixed results). reality is far more nuanced, obviously - adam smith and karl marx shared their disdain of landowners who extracted perpetual profit with no work from themselves. and there's nothing that says that a theoretical perfect market equilibrium is what anyone should strive for, specially not in the housing market as it behaves absolutely nothing like a theoretically competitive market even when regulation-free.

leasing residential is one of the few business where you can get huge amounts of pure, unadulterated cash at predictable intervals. that's because of the sheer power landlords command over tenants, who are often poor, illiquid and have their livelihood tied to the specific property in which they inhabit.  land is also an asset that lasts through generations even though it's typically priced with mortgage timeframes in mind - as in, incumbent or inherited home owners will almost always face situation where it's profitable to rent because the hypothetical break-even point assumes holding a relatively recent mortgage.

and yet \"conventional wisdom\" says rent should be able to be increased infinitely, even though *no other major household expense works like that*. when you buy a mortgage, you agree to an interest rate and have a fixed principal - likewise when you buy major ticket items like cars or sets of appliances. most businesses operates on accounts receivable of 30/60/90 days and being able to access low-interest loans. you see the pattern everywhere of taking on debt for later payment and paying at long-term fixed rates... except for rental payments, which *must* be *pure fucking cash right now at whatever price* or else *the market will literally implode*.

rent control evidently doesn't have to be price caps, but simply limit the yearly amount rent can be increased in a year-to-year basis. bc is a funny situation - the bc liberals maintained a modest rent control rate cap of inflation + 2% throughout their reign, and the policy was occasionally blamed by right-wing circles in the relative lack of rental supply coming through in the province. yet the construction of new rentals has increased under the bcndp, despite them tightening rent control to inflation-only as well as implementing a pandemic rent-freeze. because from the perspective of rental providers, the runaway house prices have meant they can sit on valuable equity while extracting cash from it even if they can't get every penny possible from tenants - the opportunity cost of renting + maintaining equity vs selling real estate has become much important than the operational cost of maintaining a rental.

so i don't understand the fundamental proposition that *any* sort of rent control is harmful. if you were to cap increases at a rate that rarely exceeds average rental price increases (say 5-6%) it's still a *massive fucking improvement* for tenants because they get to have some price certainty, much in the way literally anyone else spending significant money in society gets to have, without having any meaningful impact in the average landlord's decision to rent or not.",liberals

people tend to distract from this by pointing out the good things that lesage, lévesque, bourassa, etc. did, mainly stopping the systematic discrimination against francophone quebecers by anglophones.  they passed the charter of the french language, which made sure francophones were not discriminated against for speaking their own language in their own province.   they also get credit for taking away power from the church on the subject of schools (i am not confident that this was a good thing).

but really, the french language stuff did not happen sooner because l'union nationale at the time was just very corrupt, and their voters were in rural areas where there were no anglophones (so they didn't think preserving the french language was a priority).  the pq voters were originally a lot of the more educated, urban francophones in the province around montréal, who encountered this kind of discrimination regularly.  

i think the \"grande noirceur\" narrative of early 20th century québec is so popular because it was in the interests of the two largest québec parties that ruled the province after that period (the liberals and the parti québécois) to promote this idea that they had saved québec from this awful, oppressive regime.

edit: i also just want to say that, in a funny way, québec had a better infrastructure to deal with multiculturalism before the modern, artificial importation of french-style laïcité.   we used to have religious denomination school boards until the late 1990s.  we originally had protestant and catholic school boards, with a jewish school board established later.   i doubt we would have had the argument about bill 21 if we had just allowed a muslim school board to operate also, instead of abolishing the denomination system.",liberals

but house prices are an issue in the discussion. failing to build up and out is costing new homebuyers hundreds of thousands of dollars. you're fretting that we might spend thousands of dollars in additional taxes. you could build sewer lines and transit lines multiple times over for that cost disparity. 

&gt;imagine opening a 'pay what you want' restaurant that sold only caviar, truffles, and wagyu beef. that restaurant would be pretty popular, but it's unlikely that enough patrons would properly value the price of the ingredients and pay enough to cover the cost of a meal, let alone turn a profit, but that's exactly the situation our cities are in today.

more accurately, we're running a restaurant where we're charging every single person $5,000 / plate and you're worried that charging them only $10/parking space means we are only covering the 70% of the valet's wage. the amount of cost we are creating as a system far outweighs the cost of suburbs, and any imbalance on the suburb tax structure can readily be made up with marginally higher taxes.

&gt;there are suburb designs that aren't car dependent and actually cover the costs of their utilities, but they've been legislated out of existence.

plenty of suburb designs cover the costs of their systems, they haven't been legislated away.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-election-spending-1.5622721

also the max  changes with the length of the campaign. i don't think the libs changed that - so the longer it goes the more the richer party has an advantage. 

it can be a little bit confusing and misleading -there's the fed amount then the in riding amount and they do need to put the money up front and get it back (most of it) later so they need it in hand, and - it makes a big difference if their party is left broke afterwards due to loans and such and that's even more true if it' a minority gov't. 

so money does matter. not that much because honestly people are only so much swayed by ads and the like, you can't just 'buy' an election. but planes cost money and adverts do cost money etc etc. and they won't want to give the cpc any advantage at all. 

your idea about august is interesting - it seems a little unlikely just because covid won't likely be put entirely to bed at that point. it's also a time when people don't normally want to think about politics and it can piss them off to force them to. but it's also a time where some of the liberal's key demographics are less available - getting kids in their 20's out to vote and to campaign and door knock etc in the summer is not that easy.

&gt;lpc isn’t losing to any one party. both the ndp and cpc are chipping away at lpc support in almost equal amounts. attacking one (cpc) won’t stop the other. even if it works a bit it’s a stretch to say voting lpc has appeal for ndp supporters this time. 3/n

&gt;in 2015 voters were inspired by trudeau. in 2019 they were disappointed by him. now, many previous supporters are done with him. his negatives are highest and he leads o’toole on most likely to have hidden agenda. further underscored by when and why election called. 4/n

&gt;where we are is at critical point of election where voters decide if they want change in gov’t. that’s what i’ll be watching most closely. once they do, tend not to go back. doesn’t mean given vagaries of fptp, incumbent won’t win. but becomes matter of time after that. 5/5

h19ykex,2021-06-09T23:17:42.000-07:00,"ucp threatened on 2 flanks as ndp leads and support surges for wildrose independence party, poll suggests raj sherman.

after taft came swann, who was a nice guy, and a solid organizer, but not really charismatic. he was booted by the party and replaced by former pc mla raj sherman, who was pretty much all ego and swagger, and promised the party great things while failing to deliver.

sherman came in at the same time the pcs elected redford and the wildrose under smith was on the rise. so redford and her team decided their path to victory ran straight through the liberal party. they swung to the left, portrayed themselves as the only bulwark against the \"lake of fire\" wildrose, and proceeded to eat 2/3 of the liberal's vote. stephen carter ran redford's campaign, and had her run *juuuuust* to the left of the liberals, and managed to grab the support of major unions, including the alberta teachers association. because why vote for diet pc when you can vote for the real deal?

sherman then held on to leadership until *just before* the following election, in 2015, when he stepped down and announced he wasn't running again. the leadership was then handed back to swann on an interim basis, and swann moved back into the leadership to find the whole thing was a mess. and then two of his other mlas--hehr and kang--decided to jump ship and run federally.

so swann went into the 2015 election with just himself and laurie blakeman in edmonton centre as incumbent mlas. the liberals were a mess, their fundraising apparatus was in shambles, and they couldn't even recruit a candidate for every riding. and so, progressives skipped over them and went for notley, who presented a much more professional and confident face.",liberals

if s.33 can be casually invoked at whim for any reason, it can certainly be used to go after anti-lgbtq religious institutions, to institute \"cultural defamation\" laws, to ban social conservative protests and speech that is \"upsetting\" and even impose the human rights code on social conservative institutions that were previously exempt because of s.2 of the charter. we can shutter canada christian college and confiscate its assets. we can ban anti-abortion protests or advocacy of any kind from provincial space. we can make any insinuation against lgbtq's, cultural or racial minorities or anyone else we want a statutory tort with severe civil consequences, stripping away the shield that s.2 gave to religious iterations of this.

the pcs were polling around 45%+ for 2 years, a clear red flag.  imo wynne's liberals should have acknowledged that and moved more to the centre, at the very least, instead of moving further left.

ultimately the value of a multi-party democracy is that political parties can give voters a variety of distinct options.  the greens and ndp are both on the left side of the spectrum, so i think the ontario liberals should distinguish themselves by being a centrist party overall, rather than trying to mimic the ndp.  and they could still lean left (or right) on certain issues, while being mostly centrist.",liberals

gu2k6iv,2021-04-10T05:01:59.000-07:00,"bell: kenney sinks in poll, ucp covid wrangling, election threatened klein had a weird 90s.

he was benefited by very high natural gas prices, so there was a ton of money coming in. but hampered by low oil prices and ridiculously high interest rates (the norm for the early 90s).

so klein took one of these as \"we are in terrible straights\" , and slashed the public service. hospitals blown up, wages slashed, infrastructure delay, etc. his only goal was balance and debt. it's a drastic shift from the lougheed era of centre politics, to centre right.

then the province turned around, and klein faced challenges from the liberals. as such, his focus on debt repayment and balancing switched to minor infrastructure improvements. by the time the province was booming out of control, he paid down the debt and out came payments for everyone.

this legacy meant no debt but, massive infrastructure debt and poor trust in the public service. as such wages skyrocketed for public service, and now they are 20% then other provinces. in retrospect, he just kicked the can 25 years down the road and now we have these massive projects to pay for since the province doubled in population.

it's an illusion of \"fiscal\" . he did stop the deficit, but we are paying for it now through things he forgot. not to mention, he put all his eggs in the oil basket: and the basket is broken.",liberals

gu2p8j7,2021-04-10T05:45:36.000-07:00,"liberal delegates endorse a universal basic income, reject capital gain tax hike it will almost undoubtedly be modeled after the crb, not cerb. the liberals themselves admitted that cerb was a bandaid measure at one point, and it's part of why it morphed into the crb instead. (not the only reason mind you, which i am sure some will be keen to point out.)

any mention of cerb by people today is mostly them just not understanding the difference between cerb and crb, as i have come to notice. many people i talk to about crb tend to still think it's cerb.

the crb makes more sense to model after, even if it still needs some tweaking as well. it allows you to work at the same time, albeit with some restrictions that need that tweaking i just mentioned. it also allows you to make a pretty decent income total while still collecting. 38k aside from the benefit. not massive numbers by some people's previous income standards, but as far as helping people get out of the poverty hole gets, it's a pretty good approach. if you can make 38k or more a year, you probably don't need that kind of assistance anymore. if you do, it may be time to reassess your situation in life. or maybe not. depends on the person really.

the tweaks i mention that need to happen are things like upping the amount you can make per 2 week pay period on an average against your prior earnings. because i had a bad year in 2019, i can't make very much without risking losing the crb. that's a big problem for many people apparently. to put it into numbers for you, i only made shy of 16k in 2019 due to unforeseen circumstances. this means that at most i can only make roughly 150$ a week. rough numbers. the exact for me turns out to being something like 148.8$. that means i can only make a maximum of just under 600$ a month, or i lose crb. if crb were a bit more like ei, they would just reduce your benefit upfront. i personally don't like that method, but this method with crb isn't much better. they do the 50c on the dollar part later on if you make over 38k aside from the benefit. i like that part. the end result of that is you have to make something like 80k or so before you pay back the crb in full. (at least according to my numbers. again, this is just a rough estimate, it was more like 78k\\~ or so when i last calculated it out.)

so i figure they would be wise to make it 50% of your prior income, as that part is fine; but with the caveat that if you made less than x amount of income, you can claim the whole or larger portion of the amount. 75% perhaps, as that would fix my situation perfectly with trying to work while hours are limited and low. i picked up a job that is supposed to turn into a full time job once things reopen. but i have to deal with low hours for the first month or two. with crb, that's perfect... sort of. hence my issue with it. i can only work 18 hours per two week period for crb. since crb is bi-weekly and the  boss pays bi-monthly... they don't quite line up easily enough to make this all work hunky dory without some big caveats and concerns.

that 18 hours is the result of figuring out what is the maximum amount of time i can work before i lose crb for that 2 week period. if they allowed for more unique situations like mine where prior income was randomly low for a single year or two, i could easily be working 24 hours or more per two week period. still not full time, but crb isn't meant for full time work so much as it is meant for those who are stuck in part time right now. (as i understand)

a big reason why i even took the job because i legally have to. i am legally obligated to search for work, and i found some. now the crb is punishing me essentially for having found work. work i could not refuse without penalty to my crb benefit. (for those who don't know, yes this is a thing. you lose a few weeks of benefits.)

had she resigned in late 2017 or early 2018, they could have rebranded and put up a real fight. the pcpo losing patrick brown and the clusterfuck that followed harmed them and if the olp had a refresh they might have been able to take advantage of that more.

i mostly liked wynne as a premier. i think much of the public hate for her was fuelled for sexism and and misplace anger—much of what people were mad about or claimed was her fault were more structural issues dating back to harris and the more immediate scandals were from the mcgunity years. mcgunity resigned before they really heated up and wynne was left to deal with the blow back. women in politics have a much more difficult being able to shake that kind of backlash and it stuck with her until the very end—when most people couldn’t even member why they hated her in the first place.

h0wpgxm,2021-06-06T23:47:08.000-07:00,"politicos predict a september federal election, but if not, expect october 2023 calling it in august would be a very ballsy move for the libs. historically people punish parties who call 'unnecessary' elections, elections where it's been called for political opportunism rather than the parliament is legitimately unable to continue. 

there's been some recent cases which suggest that people were more ok with it during covid. but - with covid coming to an end, i'm not sure that would hold.  you just get free of the covid rules over the summer, you're just starting to get back to normal and live your life, and now you have to deal with an election nobody was calling for? that may not go well for them. and there's no reason to call an election when the parties aren' t even sitting in parliament or doing any work. 

and i think frank is a little optimistic that we'll be mask-free and covid restriction free by august. things will probably be better but i doubt that we'll be back to normal much before september. 

i guess trudeau could try to offset all of that by saying \"the covid spending is running out in september - if you vote for us again we'll extend it more\" and kind of put a financial 'threat' out there. 

we'll see i guess but i think it would hurt his chances to call it in august.",liberals
h0wpv4s,2021-06-06T23:50:22.000-07:00,"trudeau says ford trying to 'deflect' criticism of ontario's covid-19 response by slamming ottawa while i do agree that it is possible that ford could win i do want to say that he's burned a lot of goodwill he had before the election. so far he's pissed off:

* small business owners (covid lockdowns)
* young people (ohip+ changes)
* students (osap, online learning)
* poor people (minimum wage)
* people who are following government
* welfare recipients
* people who want a responsible handling of covid
* people who want to do what they want

anecdotally, i do know of a few people who voted ford the last election who absolutely despise him now. he's burned a lot of good will and basically all of the popularity bump he saw with covid is now gone. luckily for him he still has some of the working class, upper middle class, and family vote which does help him in the gta and could give him another win. however, the vote against him is waiting for whichever candidate has the best chance of kicking him out and i wholly expect the-anti ford vote to crowd around either the ndp or liberals once the election is called and the platforms come out. 

i think the liberals have the best chance of receiving the anti-ford vote, mainly because they're polling so high with basically no leader.",liberals

the chinese government is centrally planned with the state tightly controlling monetary policy and forcibly installing party loyalists on the board of any organization they wish. the chinese and the ussr governments are both capitalist in the sense that they use fiat currency as a medium of exchange, but beyond that the label is not applicable.

the political continuum is shaped like a horseshoe with extreme ends having many similarities that their moderate counterparts do not. restriction of personal freedom is a hallmark of both the authoritarian right as well as the authoritarian left.

do you think i am lacking knowledge?  or do you think i just fail to agree with you?

i don't think it's sophistry to say that fns basically are ethnically defined \"nations\" (not in the nation state sense but in the people with a common ethnic background sense) 

i also don't think it's sophistry to say that the expectation of these nations and their people is that they be supported by the multi-ethnic society that is the rest of canada.  perhaps it is fair expectation of any canadian that their society and fellow citizens should support them.  but these fns also have the expectation that they not have to support anyone else - that their members have different and explicitly superior rights, and that their members don't have matching obligations

for say a white or black canadian they are intrinsically going to be part of the nationstate of canada that is obligated to support the members of the fns.  they can't really get out of this obligation because they don't have the right ethnic background.  they can't just say they renounce their canadian citizenship but they will keep living here.  

and for an indigenous \"canadian\" they are intrinsically going to be part of the nation that is supported by everyone else.  they can't lose or give this up even if they move to the other side of the world.  it come's as part of their birthright.

you need the following:

1. every credit and debit card company has to agree to provide customer information to link the purchases with specific customers.
2. you need some form of coordination between the gas company and the credit processors to track the volume of gas bought in addition to the price so the rebate can be processed.
3. you also need some way to track the purchases in cash - is this done on a voluntary declaration and audit mechanism?
4. even assuming you have all this, you then need all the institutions to then have a mechanism to deposit the funds into some kind of secure system to store the funds.
5. the funds then need to be monitored and you need a system to determine what's \"green\". how \"green\" does a thing have to be? is it something you can lobby to be included on? is it open to political favouritism? when i make a purchase do i know ahead of time if i qualify, or do i have to buy it and then seek a reimbursement?

that would be why c-10 addresses itself to activity on the internet when it does act as a broadcast medium, and not when it does not.

&gt;if i have videos on my online-store web-page demoing a product, would that count?

define “count”. it may technically fit the legal definition. there is effectively zero chance, however, that it will actually be subject to regulatory requirements.

&gt;removing the user-generated content protection was silly.

“users” on sites like youtube include major record companies, hollywood studios, and other massive multinational corporations. there is effectively zero chance that individual users posting personal videos will actually be subject to regulatory requirements.

&gt;even if just looking at actual streamers, its more akin to a virtual video store (which were never regulated for cancon or had to pay into production funds) or movie theatre chains or a juke box (in the case of music).

each of those things have been treated differently for regulatory purposes in canada and around the world, so that kind of simplistic, blanket statement really doesn’t make sense. audio and audiovisual content on the internet already falls under the legal definition of “broadcasting” in canada, so there’s just as good an argument, if not better, that it’s less like a video store and more like what it legally is.

&gt;everything is on demand, and there is no limited \"airwaves\". people will watch what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.

nothing in c-10 prevents people from watching what they want when they want.

&gt;if it is about production, why is youtube or spotify or any pure streaming company that is only a distributor, and not a producer, being caught up in this? they don't make their own content (youtube did but like google often does they abandoned it).

it is not just about production, it is also about discoverability. radio stations never made the songs they aired, but were still subject to regulatory requirements.

&gt;no streamer in the music space is a producer, spotify's competitive advantage is its recommendation algorithm. that's gone if the discover weekly playlist and daily mix playlists are forced to put 30% canadian content as the radio is forced to do.

there is no reason to believe that “spotify’s competitive advantage is its recommendation algorithm.” it’s eminently arguable that spotify’s competitive advantage is as a legal source of streaming music with a massive catalogue where you can enjoy virtually anything you want.

i also question why a recommendation algorithm and canadian content obligations for (a minority) of canadian content are mutually exclusive, but even if they were, spotify wouldn’t lose a competitive advantage, because all services they effectively compete with would almost certainly have the same obligations.

&gt;it's also important to note, with both youtube and on music streaming, anybody can get their content on the service. their is no upfront payment to the creator, they have to chose to put their content on the service. payment is based on streams. so with these services, just making content and getting it on a service does an artist no good, it needs to actually be watched/listened to, to be remunerated, and no legislation can force that.

you’ve just argued that recommendation algorithms play an important role in spotify’s model; yet now you seem to be arguing that they don’t, because nothing “can force that”. which is it? set aside whether you agree with it in principle or not for a moment—by your own logic, if legislation can force changes to the recommendation algorithm, then it can have an effect on the creators that it boosts. you may disagree that it should, but you can’t claim that it’s both effective and ineffective and assisting creators at the same time.

&gt;netflix, prime, disney+, hbomax are both distributors and content producers... why should their distribution arm fund the competition (other productions) of their production arms? especially something like disney or hbo where they aren't going to carry their own non-branded stuff. if it is not an hbo and disney production, they aren't going to carry it.

it would be their own stuff. they would not be forced to fund their competition. your statement is based on a false premise.

&gt;the broad-tent services are fragmenting as distribution rights expire. more and more companies are going direct with their content... cutting out the middle-men, which bell and rogers, and corus are. which means (at least in english canada) bell had better do a lot more content production if it wants to compete when the rights to all of its us stuff expires and is not renewed. crave can become the letterkenny streaming service...

you are correct—bell, rogers, and corus have made money on being middle-men, and that market is disappearing. but the challenges of a very small market (canada) means they cannot compete with a service that is based on the much large american market, or the world market. so crave will not become the “letterkenny streaming service”, because a one-show streaming service is not economically sustainable. bell, rogers, and corus will do what they’ve been doing—or been trying to do—already: close down content arms, lay off canadian creators and other canadian employees, and try to sell off their media operations to international players, with the result that canadian content is no longer being produced by them and canadians have fewer jobs.

&gt;and to that end, as more and more services start to carry just their own stuff, who carries this cancon that is being funded? its one thing to pay into a fund to help make it, its another to force them to license it and carry it when its not made by them.

again, it is their own stuff, and it will be made by them.

&gt;we are going to pay for a bunch of content that no one wants or watches... why?

you just argued that bell could maintain a service with letterkenny (which is cancon). now you are arguing that nobody wants or watches cancon (which includes letterkenny). which is it?

“nobody wants or watches” canadian content, except for the millions of canadians who do, except for the streaming services like netflix that are already paying millions of dollars to commission it, and except for the international bodies that bestow awards upon it, like emmys for schitt’s creek and tatiana maslany.

in my opinion, your attitude is the result of a canadian [inferiority complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_cringe) that secretly—or not so secretly—believes that canada has little-to-no worth culturally, has no talent, no stories to tell, and does not deserve a space on the national or world stages. i disagree on many, many levels, but i do wish that people who have such low opinions of canadian culture and/or creators would get out of the way so the rest of us can support and celebrate our artists and ourselves.",liberals

in what way exactly do you think its harmful? to individual everyday people?

its kind of rich hearing this when you consider the habit of right wing politics to rely on some \"other\" to vilify. i think you're trying to paint this somehow idealized version of right wing politics which ignores the increasingly extreme elements making it into mainstream discourse, on top of brushing aside the historical 'vilification' that right wingers have engaged in and caused actual harm to a number of communities (see lgtbq+ for example). it seems you dont like the branding instead of maybe evaluating if there is a propensity for conservative thought to lead to violence. 

&gt; it does dissect it from the ideology itself since the ideology has nothing to do with it.

yes it does though. you cant just pick and choose what you consider right wing so that its convenient in this exact moment, especially given right wing politics shift in the past few decades to increased extremism as mainstream. like with the example i gave, it is directly connected to religious conservatism (see right wing politics), these people believe (wrongly) that abortion clinics are **literally** killing children (even the ones who dont blow up clinics have engaged in plenty of 'intimidation' of civilians btw). their decision to commit violence has nothing to do with the right wing, thats why its called terrorism, but the who it is against and why they do it is the ideological driven part. a right winger likely opposes abortion, a right wing terrorist apposes abortion and is willing to firebomb clinic about it. thats why we add the word 'terrorism' instead of just calling it \"right wing politics\"",liberals

“▪ xenophobic violence
xenophobic violence is defined as the fear or hatred
of what is perceived to be foreign, different or strange, which leads to racially motivated violence. this has traditionally been referred to in the canadian context as white supremacy or neo-nazism.


▪ anti-authority violence
anti-authority violence is defined as the opposition to, or rejection of, the authority of the state which leads to anti-government and violence against law enforcement. the 2014 moncton shooting is an example of anti- authority violence.


▪ gender-driven violence
gender-driven violence is defined as the hatred of those of a different gender and or sexual orientation which can lead to violent misogyny. the 2018 toronto van attack is an example of gender-driven violence.


▪ other grievance-driven and ideologically motivated violence
some ideologically motivated violent extremists act without a clear affiliation to an organized group or external guidance. they are nevertheless shaped by the echo chambers of online hate that normalize and advocate violence. more than ever, the internet allows individuals to not only share their extreme views, but also their manifestos and details of attacks. all these activities can inspire others to conduct attacks of their own.”",liberals

gnuzksv,2021-02-17T14:38:49.000-08:00,"trudeau said canada committed genocide. why won’t he say the same of china? by robyn urback.

in canada, i think we're accustomed to thinking of the term \"genocide\" as encompassing cultural genocide, because of the residential schools. but on the international level, that's not necessarily true - people think of \"genocide\" in the more traditional sense, as mass murder with the aim of extermination.

the economist, 
[“genocide” is the wrong word for the horrors of xinjiang](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/13/genocide-is-the-wrong-word-for-the-horrors-of-xinjiang):

&gt; by the common understanding of the word, it is not. just as “homicide” means killing a person and “suicide” means killing yourself, “genocide” means killing a people. china’s persecution of the uyghurs is horrific: it has locked up perhaps 1m of them in prison camps, which it naturally mislabels “vocational training centres”. it has forcibly sterilised some uyghur women. but it is not slaughtering them.
&gt;
&gt; ...  until now, america’s state department had applied the “genocide” label only to mass slaughter, and even then it often hesitated, for fear that uttering the term would create an expectation that it would intervene. it did not call rwanda’s genocide a genocide until it was practically over.
&gt; 
&gt; america’s political rhetoric has thus undergone a dramatic shift, which has profound implications for the world’s most important bilateral relationship. by accusing china of genocide, it is sending the signal that its government has committed the most heinous of crimes. and yet at the same time it is proposing to deal with it over global warming, pandemics and trade.
&gt;
&gt; ... mr biden is right to decry china’s abuses, but he should do so truthfully. the country is committing crimes against humanity. by accusing it of genocide instead, in the absence of mass murder, america is diminishing the unique stigma of the term. genocide should put a government beyond the pale; yet american officials will keep doing business with the regime they have branded genocidal.",liberals

&gt;in the present convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

&gt;(a) killing members of the group;

&gt;(b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

&gt;(c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

&amp;#x200b;

|you are talking about east jerusalem, also most palestinians were not kicked out of east jerusalem in the war in the 1960's they are still living there. east jerusalem's population is still majority arab.

they were kicked out, and not just of west jerusalem, of the surrounding areas in the 40s through 60s and later.  in fact, they are still removing arab families out of their houses in the 20s right now, it literally kicked off the last conflict.

&amp;#x200b;

this is what the un did, it basically put all of jerusalem entirely deep into palestinian territory.

everything else, israel basically took through a series of wars of dubious legal basis and later ended up dispossessing the arab citizens of their legal owned land.

&amp;#x200b;

|as i said, west jerusalem was recognized as part of israel at the same time as tel aviv. it is not internationally disputed. also i would be open to putting our embassy for india in kashmir if kashmir happend to be the political hq for india, which it isn't.

&amp;#x200b;

this entire statement is false. tel aviv was given to israel by the un.  israel took jerusalem through a series of wars thereafter.  jerusalem is disputed, even obama was telling israel they must go back to the pre-1967 border.

that puts jerusalem entirely back into palestine.

i think you'd be open to many ideas that are not in our best interest, which is why i oppose it.

&amp;#x200b;

israel may have a valid concern in occupying territory terrorist will launch missiles and attacks from.  however, it doesn't mean we should start building embassies on those occupied territories, as ultimately, they have to go back to palestine once that terrorism stops and peace prevails.  israel cannot just steal land from arabs in the territory and expect for us to endanger our diplomats for them.  the issue isn't just israel taking or occupying the land from palestine.  it is ignoring and undermine the rule of law and property rights of the palestinians in those occupied territories.  ie. palestinians with deeds to their houses literally thrown on the street and their property rights totally ignored.  in many cases they are outright murdered during this evictions in cold blood according israeli military own officials who've given such accounts on video. we don't want to be in the middle of that situtation.",conservatives

&gt; wilkinson called the plan unserious, repeatedly referring to it as a carbon tax and comparing it to \"petro-points,\" a redeemable points loyalty program from the oil and gas company petrocanada. 
&gt; 
&gt; \"if you think about, you now have to create these separate accounts for every canadian, you have to track their use of gasoline and natural gas and propane … and find a way to flow back into these accounts the money that is associated with a price on pollution that will be different in different jurisdictions,\" wilkinson said, calling the proposal \"incredibly complicated.\"
&gt; 
&gt; he also said the $50 per tonne cap isn't high enough to make a difference.
&gt; 
&gt; \"it's capped at $50 …  and you can talk to any economist, if you really want carbon pricing to be effective at reducing pollution, it needs to go beyond $50,\" he said. \"this is just not serious.\"

she then adopted behavior that was totally unbecoming of a leader, and i'm not even talking about her claims of racism, yet, that are without a doubt probable, we'll get to that in a moment.

here is what happened:

1) israel resumed settlement of palestine.
2) there were calls from her party for her to come out and condemn this as per democratically determined party policy.
3) she did not
4) her advisor publically threatened, no, declared that 'we will work to defeat you' to atwin, one of those who called on her to condemn the settlement. by the way, atwin was an elected mp.
5) there were now cries for paul to fire the advisor.
6) she declined to fire him, citing 'difference of opinion'
7) atwin crossed the floor.

she didn't cross the floor because paul is black, or a woman, or jewish. it's because she failed as a leader to uphold the positions of her party and allowed her advisor to openly threaten party members or work towards defeating her own elected party members.

you can't do that in canadian politics, especially when your party has 3 seats.

so now we come to race. there is no doubt in my mind that she has faced bigotry of many types. she is a bald, black, jewish lady. no doubt she has faced immense hurdles. everyone knows that.

she comes up on stage, on national tv, and declares that she has faced racism, it's been hard to get to where she is, she had to crawl on broken glass to get there (finger pointing the whole time at others flaws or her own party's flaws, when she broke the glass, or at least made no effort to clean it up.) 

she claimed that trudeau was a fake feminist, when he has the best record on feminism in politics. she claimed he pushed out strong women and named them, but we know it didn't have anything to do with gender or race, and not everything boils down to that. and by the way, if it does our beloved multicultural canada is fucked.

so juxtapose her with jagmeet singh. you think he stands up on stage and talks about how hard his life has been in canada, or running as mp and leader of the ndp? how hard it's been as a turban wearing bearded sikh man?
finger pointing is not how jagmeet does business, this is.

support in the form of contracts on work received is a symbiotic partnership. a company that is riddled with delays, inefficiencies, financial problems, and a legacy family that holds the company hostage is another thing. 



first, bombardier is laughingly lagging behind their aerospace peers in all metrics (one only has to look at their stock price over any extended period). for instance, bombardier stock returned 23.56% over the past 5 years (without factoring dividend re-investment for their peers). compared to 111.15% for airbus, 67.22% for boeing, 47.92% for lockheed martin, 69% for northrop grumman, and so forth. in terms of actual core company performance, two easy metrics to gauge operational capabilities is ebitda margins, return on investment capital (roic) and return on assets (roa). between 2015-2020, the average ebitda margin of bombardier was 3.7%, when in the same period the s&amp;p 500 aerospace company components on average earned an ebitda margin was 13.5%. that is a huge difference! average roic for bombardier was 3.8% (2015-2020), their peer group averaged 23.5%. average roa for bombardier was 0.8%, their peer group earned an roa of 5.1% between 2015-2020. bombardier is a garbage company, held hostage by the founder’s family though the dual share structure. as such no outside shareholder with a competent plan can come and turn this company around. quebec should not need to give emergency loans and equity investments into bombardier just for them to keep going and honor their contracts.",liberals

second, you have red tories backwards (this is a common mistake that has sadly become more common because we are forgetting our political history). the quintessential red tory in recent canadian politics is david orchard (the quintessential red tory pm was diefenbaker). what made red tories red was that they supported the welfare state, albeit in a more paternalistic way (e.g. we need a strong state to protect the nation).

while i agree that the ontario pcs have often been more focused on fiscal conservatism, i'm not sure that really captures ford nation. ford *is* very fiscally conservative, but that wasn't how rob or doug won such a big coalition of supporters.

rob ford was a master of populist politics - he was adept at dividing people into two bifurcated groups (often in ways that were ancillary to politics, like weight), and associating his group with the people against entrenched elites. institutions like city council and the toronto star fed into it too.

often that involved playing to cultural conservatism too, but you sound different notes in toronto than alberta. like, rob anders out in calgary used to brag about being a virgin, because it made him such a good christian. instead ford would brag that he got \"plenty of pussy at home\" when he was accused of sexual harassment. you don't have to go religious to be a homophobe either - ford would do this big kabuki play about not going to the gay pride parade, be the sole vote in opposition to shelters for lgbtq people, and say things like “if you’re not doing needles and you’re not gay, you won’t get aids, probably.” it's a more secular macho brand of cultural conservatism.

doug ford is somewhat more conventional than rob, but you can see him playing the same kind of game. the decision to single out francophone education spending, the crusade for $1 beer, or the shell game over the notwithstanding clause is about reinforcing the stark distinctions between the virtuous people, and the corrupt elites (with the implication that those on the elite side are sellouts).",conservatives

the similarity between the spd and the lpc is that they are both establishment centre-left parties.

to emphasize this, keep in mind the spd ran this election on a wealth tax, increasing taxes on high earners, reducing means-testing and a 'citizens wage'.

a minority can too if you have a dancing partner and the liberals did. between the ndp,bloc and yes even the cpc (they voted for a lot of liberal bills) the liberals have always had someone to make sure bills pass.

conservatives: small business incentives, boost mental health spending, suicide prevention hotline.  emergency preparedness plan for pandemics, wind down covid stimulus, invest in opioid treatment.  paying 50% of wages for 6 months for new hires, 5% investment tax credit for business, infrastructure and internet upgrades.  child care tax credit, job training plan. 5 billion in green energy research funding.  increased pipelines.  increased disability supplement, larger low income benefits.  investing in power grid to make it more green, investment in climate solutions.  hiring 200 rcmp, and creating a foreign interference task force.  more military spending, more veteran spending.  3 billion to improve seniors homes and open up immigration for long term care workers.",conservatives
