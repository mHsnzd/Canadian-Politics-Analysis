&gt;in order to remain nonpartisan, neither the clerk nor any member of the clerk's staff is permitted to reveal the outcome of a ruling ahead of time. it's also against normal practice to negotiate the timing of a ruling's release with just one party which could have given it a strategic advantage.

hdf0ue0,2021-09-18T13:03:13.000-07:00,"ppc spells trouble for conservatives in ontario battlegrounds this is why i have mixed feelings about the rise of a prominent far right party in canadian politics. the cpc will attempt to reabsorb these ppc voters at some point, and it can only do so by pandering to the far right. to some extent we see it already. meanwhile, those who \"identify as conservative\" find it almost impossible to vote for anyone to the left of the cpc, so there's less incentive to keep any moderate policies since abandoning them won't lose voters. in the short term it splits the conservative vote. but longer term it will pull the cpc and its supporters further to the right, and the centre of gravity of canadian politics will follow. it could be similar to the tea party's long term effect on republicans.

whether it plays out like this depends on how many voters there are who actually waver between liberal and conservative. if there are enough, things could go better.",conservatives

hdf3jsn,2021-09-18T13:23:45.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected i agree with basically everything you're saying, except for how bad ranked ballots would be. it would give a boost to the liberals, but i think the strength of that boost has been pretty overstated.

just looking at how the 2019 election might have turned out under ranked voting, according to this article trudeau still wouldn't have won a majority.

[https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/who-wins-election-2019-under-a-ranked-ballot-system/](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/who-wins-election-2019-under-a-ranked-ballot-system/)

they don't have perfect information, so this isn't how it exactly how it would have gone, but i would argue that this actually overestimates the number of seats the liberals would win. the method they used doesn't take into account how much strategic/abc voting there currently is under fptp, so i would expect the gains to smaller parties like the ndp, greens and ppc to be even larger, and the gains by the liberals to be smaller. and considering that they only gained 9 seats under the overly-optimistic estimate, i think the amount that ranked ballot would favor the liberals has been overstated.

i still agree that pr would be far better that ranked ballot, and if we are bothering to switch systems, we should obviously switch to the best option, but i would still much rather be voting in a ranked ballot system than fptp.",liberals

but my guess is that you can't possibly operate that way. right now, you could donate both of your kidney's. the backup in people who need kidney's is massive and people die all the time on the waiting list. if your objective function is truly some sort of \"societal welfare\", then i suppose you could kill yourself, and at the very least your kidneys could save two lives, as well as whatever other organs could be harvested.

the whole notion of equity is that the same rule or benefit has different impacts on different people. i think your example works, but i can give a few other silly ones, if it would help. if you're interested in further reading, i'd suggest looking into gender-based analysis or equity.

more upsetting, failing to account for diversity can be measurably awful in terms of outcomes. women are more likely to die of a heart attack because of a failure to recognize differences in symptoms between genders. they're also more likely to be hurt by a seatbelt, and black women are significantly more likely than anyone else to suffer complications in childbirth. any number of horribly sexist or racist practices have been justified by saying \"it's the same rule for everyone\", without giving any consideration to the propriety or importance of the rule.

here, with bill-21, discrimination seems to be the whole point. part of my own bias coming into it is that i see absolutely no social benfit in regulating personal religious garb by a teacher or a police officer. so to me, it's cruelty for cruelty's sake.",liberals

since late february our supply of vaccines has been steady from pfizer. they temporarily slowed production and shipments because they were expanding their european facility to be able to make more vaccines more quickly in january and early february. 

we’ve had bulk shipments from astra zeneca arrive periodically. but moderna has had issues with their european plant, so supply from there has been less so. we can’t get from the american plant because of their america first policy, which was also preventing supplies needed to manufacture vaccines from be shipped elsewhere. for example, the us sat on tens of millions of astra zeneca doses and refused to send production materials to india so they could increase their az manufacturing capacity.",conservatives

now there's going to be both small and micro left wing parties in canada, which doesn't bode well for electoral success.",liberals

that doesn't sounds right to me. if there was only one seat, it would be perfectly **unproportional** (the conservatives would have 100% of the parliament and all the other parties would have 0%).

the effect of increasing the number of seats is ambiguous, it depends on the geographic distribution of votes. as a rule of thumb, more seats is probably *slightly* more proportional.

the ways you can improve proportionality are by:

1. adding top-up seats which are distributed to maintain proportionality
2. creating multi-member districts with multiple winners.

method 2 can be taken to the level of a single national district with 300+ winners, which might be what you had in mind.",conservatives

hh6mj1h,2021-10-18T11:56:49.000-07:00,"it’s irresponsible for justin trudeau to equate the far right and far left in canada &gt;a competitive capital gains tax was designed originally to help encourage people, institutions, and organizations to make investments in the economy, in hopes of garnering a return. these investments help generate tax revenue for the state (province, state, federal government etc.), create jobs (people involved in making whatever investment happen, which pays even more tax, increases consumer spending etc. makes the world go round), it may provide services long-term if it was a public sector investment as well and the list goes on. to specify, i can use more clearer examples to help you understand what i am saying. first example, the government decides to spend billions on infrastructure to build more go lines in the gta. they hire private construction companies who employ a lot of people who help build these go lines. the government collects tax back from the company who made money and as well as the workers who work for the company. on top of all of that, they are left with a service that the public can use - at a cost - which provides revenue for the government to help employ more people to maintain it, run it (etc. etc. etc.). this is one example of an investment, but it is a public investment so capital gains may not be applicable but you see the layers of the process.

i am aware of how an investment works.

&gt;maybe a better example is building a home, a company hires people, where people work for them, and then they sell it (using a real estate agent who pays tax) and in the end the developer makes a capital gains profit. if the capital gains tax is increased, maybe a lot of these opportunities are no longer opportunities because their venture is no longer profitable. and that is why we need capital gains to remain competitive. this also applies to the stock market, but it is more blurry because of things like the tfsa and rrsp that are designed to help canadians lower their tax burden and grow their investments.

this is not an argument against raising capital gains tax, it is an argument for more progressive tax policy as it pertains to the development of new homes. this also ignores the reality that a lot of developers are currently choosing to build luxury homes and apartments for better margins, a development type that in reality helps very few average canadians in the long run even though it may provide temporary work for some- while all work employs people, not all work is equally productive or progressive.

&gt;here is a piece from the us senate joint economic committee studying the impacts of capital gains taxation throughout us history. on page 2, in the executive summary they say: \"the historical evidence suggest that capital gains tax reductions tend to increase tax revenue. when capital gains tax rates were lowered in 1978 and again in 1981, revenue climbed steadily. conversely, when the tax rate was increased in 1987, revenue began declining despite forecasters predictions it would increase. for instance, capital gains tax revenue in 1985 equaled $36.4billion after adjusting for inflation, yet $36.2 billion was collected in 1994 under a higher tax rate. in other words, tax revenue in 1994 was slightly less than it was in 1985 even though the economy was larger, the tax rate was higher, and the stock market was stronger in 1994.\" below is the study, you can read all of it if you want, it is pretty insightful.

&gt;https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b3116098-c577-4e64-8b3f-b95263d38c0e/the-economic-effects-of-capital-gains-taxation-june-1997.pdf

the economist who is credited in the study is [shahira knight,](https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=36878) a lobbyist for the investment &amp; securities industry. she played a major role in the [tax cuts and jobs act of 2017,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_cuts_and_jobs_act_of_2017) a tax plan that was [widely opposed](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reforms/) by [economists.](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/tax-reform-2/)

the obvious bias and lack of impartiality of the study aside, it *was* part of the previous consensus on capital gains taxes- a consensus which is now criticized for its holistic assumption that capital gains taxes always creates inefficiencies in investment.

&gt;\"the preferential treatment afforded to dividends and capital gains is another example of tax provisions where the official rationale has little to do with the actual effects. the argument has been put forward that the u.s. should encourage savings. but the savings of most americans (through their pension funds and 401(k) programs) already receive preferential treatment. when taxes on capital gains and dividends were lowered, the benefits were extended to investments made prior to the enactment. these tax benefits were simply windfall gains. tax revenues were reduced, without any concomitant increases in investment.

&gt;in the end, the special treatment did not have the benefits promised. instead of household savings increasing, after the enactment of the bush tax cuts, the savings rate plummeted to new lows.

&gt;there is, moreover, no justification for taxing those who work hard to earn a living at a higher rate than those who derive their income from speculation.\"

https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ri_reforming_taxation_white_paper_201405.pdf

&gt;to conclude, investments make the world go round, literally. we want companies, and the public - me and you - to make investments to help drive the economy. capital gains tax increases may reduce the number of opportunities because of profitability - it will reduce the number of profitable opportunities to make investments. when we want to encourage people to invest their money, not sit on it, we incentivize it through the capital gains tax. that is where its power lies.

economics is not as simple as \"tax go up gdp go down\".",liberals

another example is a white woman who accused someone of being racist towards me (when they weren’t) because she disagreed with what they were saying. these kinda things happen often too. 

then there’s the benevolent racism. trying to give poc freebies as if we’re incapable of accomplishing things on our own. a big example of this is when i saw woke peeps circulating this preposterous idea that black people aren’t good at math and should be graded more leniently. there was a whole thing about how math and science are supposedly racist. and no, they weren’t talking about the atmosphere in academia lol. they were actually talking about math and the scientific method. funny thing is that they don’t realize this is the saaaame thing that the far-right believes: that somehow poc are intellectually inferior.

i’ve seen people create these romanticized ideas of our cultures and then behave as if poc are just these angels who can do no wrong. this is dehumanizing because white people are allowed to have a full spectrum of human emotions and flaws but we’re being put on these pedestals, which will inevitably crash because we’re human to and we make mistakes. anytime you do see a scenario of a poc or an ethnic group engaging in harmful practice, you just hear these woke folks blame white supremacy even when it’s irrelevant. as a result, we suffer. especially women and children. a good example of this is honor killings and fgm in the uk. the fact of the matter is that these practices are disproportionately present in certain ethnic communities. if you can’t identify the problem, you can’t fix it. but their government has become afraid of being labeled racist so they just don’t do anything about it. as a result, it’s girls and women that are suffering. if white women were facing the same abuse, something would be done. but when brown and black women face this abuse, they’re treated as second class citizens because “it’s their culture. it’s racist to criticize”. 

i find benevolent racism to be so much more insidious. first they love bomb you and make you believe they’re the good guys who really truly understand you and are on your side! then they use you for their personal political agendas, treat you as less human, basically perpetuate the same harmful myths that the far-right does, and then give themselves a pat on the back at the end of the day. and this results in an internalized victim mentality in poc, especially the younger generation. and i hate to use “victim mentality” but i can’t think of another word at the moment. i’ve seen so many young poc being told they’re perpetual victims and the whole world is against them and basically nothing will ever change and they should feel unsafe. this becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and now i see a lot of kids feeling this way. i even started to feel this way for a while. i kept telling these people that things really weren’t as bad as they were making it sound, and they basically told me that i didn’t know the issues that affected my own community lol. benevolent racism is so insidious because you can’t see it. it’s not direct and you don’t easily see who the enemy is.


and then there are those who feel like they have license to be fully racist towards those poc that they vehemently disagree with. i’ve seen black and brown radfems getting abused nonstop. i’ve been white people calling them british slaves and “uncle toms”. i’ve seen black women being compared to males when transactivists debate gender, despite the fact that black women have explained numerous times how this is racist and to be left out of the narrative. i’ve seen horrible racism directed at these women and when you call them out, they justify it by saying these women are “terfs”. so basically white wokes have full license to be racist, misogynistic, and dehumanize woc if they disagree with their views. 

oh and then there are the white wokes who try to “teach” me about my own culture lol. i’ve seen them using historical examples of things from my culture to further their agendas, i’ve called them out, and then i’ve been lectured about my own culture lol. because they’re so busy creating these romanticized myths of our cultures. 


i’ve come to the conclusion that these people often don’t care about actual poc issues. they just wanna feel good about themselves. i just remembered another example from my city. there’s a neighborhood with a large population of a certain ethnicity and gun crime is high. so the people from this actual community want law enforcement to step it up and give harsh sentences. but what do white woke folks do? they speak over this community and demand that the justice system be lenient solely based on the ethnicities of these perpetrators. like obv it’s a diff story when it comes to sentencing for petty crimes. poc are punished more harshly and other circumstances need to be taken into account, but these activists can’t distinguish between petty crime and serious violent crime. and they ignore the wishes of the actual community affected by it.

oh and then there are all the leftists who call poc white supremacists when they disagree with them. this happens a lot. i was called a white supremacist because i liked bernie sanders more than elizabeth warren lol. speaking of that election, the antisemitism with the left is through the roof too. comparing every minor inconvenience to the holocaust, just like the far right does. i’ve seen people compare bernie sanders (a jewish man who lost family in the holocaust) to nazis. these were warren supporters. oh and the way they defended warren with her whole native scandal. they compare everyone they disagree with to white supremacists, which is really really insulting to those of who actually have suffered the impacts of white supremacy. like the mere notion of these comparisons just shows such a lack of compassion, empathy, and touch with reality tbh.

yes, but you need to understand the intricacies of how a capital gains tax is involved in investments.

no, it is an argument against a capital gains tax increase because it would apply here to the developer. it can also be applied beyond the scope of the development of new homes.

fair enough, she would have a stake in coming to a certain conclusion. but we can verify with other sources to see if her conclusion is in any way accurate, and it turns out, it is. there is a balancing act to be played out here that i recognize what you are saying, but a 50% inclusion rate here in canada seems more than fair to me. do you think it should be 75% like the ndp said, or higher?

this is an investment guide, not a macro-economics source.

&gt;https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/rethinking-how-we-score-capital-gains-tax-reform/ (go to \"how far can you stretch a tax?\")

did you even read this yourself? from this exact source:

&gt;on the other hand, the authors posit that these behavioral effects are overstated, resulting in a potentially severe underestimate of the revenue at play from capital gains tax increases. they offer three reasons to suggest that elasticities on capital gains taxes are overstated, which highlight the need for more scorekeeping transparency:

&gt;* first, most existing research on capital gains taxes is focused on short-term effects of rate changes; that is, what will taxpayers do, say, in the year following a change in rates. the new rates, of course, persist over time, and the current short-run focus misses the medium- and long-run revenue capture that would occur in years two, three, four, and so on. 

&gt;* second, revenue estimates may understate the substitution between capital gains and other forms of income, such as dividends or wages for finance professionals and executives. 

&gt;* and third, the uncertainty about how scorekeepers incorporate dynamic effects into various capital gains reform proposals complicates apples-to-apples evaluation of alternatives. 

&gt;* broadly speaking, then, while people certainly can, and do, defer capital gains to avoid taxation, they eventually realize far more of those gains than scorekeepers assume. this raises the question of how many more revenues could be gained by raising the capital gains tax rates to, say, the level of income taxes—or roughly doubling the rate from 20 to 40 percent. the authors calculate that such a change could raise over $1 trillion dollars over time. 

so basically restating what i just said in my last post about how the position you present in your posts is not a consensus among economists- it's really disingenuous to present it as such.

you also did not respond to the stiglitz paper i linked, i wonder why.

&gt;again, you aren't reading critically. a capital gains tax specifically, is directly related to investments, which does impact gdp. increasing the capital gains tax will impact investments, pretending it doesn't, is just not true. those sources also note that too.

no, it is not. setting the rules for his own department is his literal job. there is an obvious conflict of interest in someone overseeing his own investigation. it is not inappropriate to insist that no one oversees their own investigation. vance gloating that he is untouchable is honestly a fireable offense on its own. 

&gt;the civil service, investigations, and judicial procedures are all supposed to be absolutely independent of political interference

that's not political interferences it is precluding interference by the person being investigated. he's not directing a particular finding he would be stopping retaliation against the people doing the investigation. but apparently having an ethical competent leadership is a bridge too far.

&gt;that is absolutely true as well. so saajan stepped into this with harper's rules in place and with harper's guy in place.

vance made most of the changes under trudeau, and spent most of the time under trudeau.

what's more the cds can be dismissed for any reason at any time. he does not have a fixed term, and he spent far more time reporting to sajjan with sajjan and trudeau covering for him than the six months he spent under harper. 

&gt;vance was a harper loyalist to the end. there was absilutely no love lost between vance and the liberals, 

he backed them railroading norman, they protected him against an investigation and were only stopped from protecting him when vance was forced to step down.

he was plainly trudeau's and sajjan's guy. if he wasn't he would have been replaced, he wouldn't have been protected, sajjan wouldn't have run and hid from the ombudsman and would have actually managed his file.

but i guess the lpc talking point is to pretend that somehow ministers can do nothing ever under any circumstances, in order to justify an absent minister.

that is not that much compared to production increases - and more importantly, the transport route of those pipelines is a significant factor here.

the sole largest reason for this is our bottlenecked coastal egress. we can't do anything with most of our production except for ship it out to the us. and when you have one primary buyer for something who also produces that same thing... they get to dictate the price more or less as they have such purchasing power over us it's almost a hostage situation (relative to their own product, both wti and wcs move up and down in response to things like opec cuts, etc).

i'm guessing it's because the election is scheduled for june 2022 and the law extended the ban on third party spending from 6 months to 12 months (so starting now), so they want the law in place for next election and the only way to do that is to use the nwc. it reminds me a bit of the last case where they threatened to use the nwc to make sure the next toronto election would occur under the new rules if courts didn't correct the ruling quickly enough. due to the threat, the court of appeals treated the appeal in priority and rejected the previous ruling in record time, so they didn't need it.

the social contract came on the heel end of regan-thatcherism, with all the devastation it had wrought plain for canadians to see. it was elected on the work of organized labour, as the party of labour, and with full view of the anti-union and anti-labour fervour devastating workers across the anglo west.

in that context, for the party of labour to not only run on a budget-first governing priority - a priority it set for no reason other then the political calculation of hopeful reelection - but to achieve its aims by unilaterally imposing wage cuts on hundreds of thousands of ontarians, this was uniquely egregious in the history of canadian working class political movement. the forced days off - an experiment worthy of its dystopian title, *the social contract -* have been etched into the political imagination of ontario and canada for good reason. 

chretian and martin were influenced by regan-thaterism (&amp; mulroney) in their further deminishment of public services. they were also influenced by bob rae &amp; the ontario ndp itself. while public service attacks were nothing new in 1993, rae demonstrated that even a party elected with the effort of organized labour couldn't be stopped from waging austerity. the option for workers was to choose between the lesser of evils, and no one had to promise them anything. rae (&amp; the saskatchewan ndp under romanow) set the narrative for the next 30 years of public sector relations, becoming a model for an ndp machine that demands loyalty from unions when in opposition, then balancing its political position on the backs of workers and unions while in power. the manitoba, alberta and bc ndp have all followed in this tradition.

that's the rub, right? when folks think of what the rcmp do they think of hollywood style violence. having been on a coroner's inquest jury for a police-involved death, it really opened my eyes on _how completely incorrect_ the rcmp are as a tool for dealing with a significant portion of their calls: domestic disputes and mental health. 

_i will never, ever willingly call the police to come to my aid._ their training is _too poor_ to trust them not to make things worse.

it's an education problem, isn't it? tories need to shake the vision of the rcmp officer standing against ne'er-do-wells and think of the rcmp officer charging into a house, weapon raised, to confront someone undergoing psychosis.

&gt; trouble is, nobody has figured that out yet and government investment really isn't moving the needle. but i'm all in on nuclear. nuclear nuclear nuclear. 

and [several conservative provinces support nuclear](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alberta-3-other-provinces-to-sign-agreement-to-explore-small-nuclear-reactors-1.5386817), too! it's a start.

is it taboo? this is how paramedical, dental and pharmacare work _right now_.

i don't think a universal option necessarily means that a private option cannot also exist; the private sector wouldn't be a threat if the public sector were adequately efficient and funded. efficient, first.

&gt;  i remain skeptical. i think the tax credits lever should die out, to be honest.

eh, i think that's how they should operate: provide credits/grants/loans to invigorate the creation of a necessary industry, and phase those out over time. think of the government as an angel investor.

hjyog45,2021-11-09T02:04:02.000-08:00,"conservatives dominate twitter and facebook. so why are they complaining? this is a remarkable example of shifting the goal posts, so let's be clear about one thing first: **absolutely nothing you said disputes any of the claims i made.**

instead, you chose to shift to discussing different claims, almost all of which have been deliberately framed in ways to convey nefarious connotations that may or may not exist.

let me be clear: i do not trust big pharma. i am deeply opposed to capitalism in our healthcare system (and generally lol). it sets up all sorts of negative incentives and it's a terrible place for a market (there is effectively no upper bound on the price somebody will pay for their own life and as a result any health market is subject almost exclusively to power dynamics rather than price dynamics).

all of that can be true, however, without changing the claims that i made, which is probably why you elected to simply ignore all of my claims and make a bunch of new ones.

the claim i made was that there exists an objective truth, that truth has to some extent been credibly described and understood, and actively rejecting understood truths is lying. i demonstrated that with one body of such truths.

the fact that you are unable to refute those truths and have shifted to making unrelated allegations about covid vaccines demonstrates a) my claims were pretty unassailably right, and b) exactly the problem we were discussing at the start of this thread: people willingly distorting true information to serve ideological purposes and what to do about them. 

it's actually really useful because while i do believe that there's a role to play for information sharers and platforms to moderate objectively false information, the natural response by people interested in sharing false information is to do, well, exactly what you just demonstrated so clearly: shift the goal posts to \"asking questions\" in order to obfuscate that they can't assail the true things and cause confusion and chaos so people lose track of the true stuff. and that is much harder to moderate, because people do have a right to ask questions and seek information and debate interpretations. by simply avoiding the actual truth to whenever it comes up, you can escape and \"true/false\" moderation. i don't have  a good systemic answer for that other than strong critical thinking skills for individual internet users.

but here is the thing to keep in mind about asking questions: **questions have answers.** if you are asking questions to pursue those answers, that's a very worthwhile thing. if you are asking questions to sow doubt and avoid losing a debate, well, you can do that too. but it isn't what i would consider particularly ethical, particularly if the discussion in question has very real health risks for participants who take your subtext claim of \"doubt the vaccine!\" to heart.

when you do that, you're not debating or discussing. you're push-polling.",conservatives

it's perfectly fine to have broad sweeping debates about reality in principle, but when the rubber hits the road you need actionable, objectively true information. when i got my pilot's license i had to learn to navigate in a way that accounts for the curve of the earth or else i'd be off course every time i used a map.

so these fun debates are fine on  reddit or at an afterparty with your 8th drink or whatever, but when conveying \\*actionable\\* information it needs to reflect consensus reality.

h1fjajf,2021-06-11T04:22:15.000-07:00,"the notwithstanding clause isn’t meant to be safety net for political blundering you're right, and that's why i personally don't talk about \"activist judges.\" it's a loaded term, and many of the people who complain about \"judicial activism\" are, as you said, just mad about the outcome of a particular case. at the same time, we shouldn't be too quick to dismiss concerns about judicial power.

the american court is currently very conservative, so conservatives are comfortable with judicial power. progressives, meanwhile, are becoming sceptical. in the 1960s, it was progressives who championed judicial power and conservatives who were sceptical. the *lochner* era of 1897-1937 was similar to today: a conservative court facing progressive criticism of judicial power.

my point isn't that the canadian courts are in immediate danger of minority capture--they're not. i'm just saying that things can change. we should assess judicial power from the perspective of how we'd feel if it were used against us. it's worth noting that, in the 1980s, many progressives were sceptical of the courts' ability/willingness to enforce the charter. the courts didn't have a great record on individual rights (they were, for example, generally hostile to workers' rights legislation), and there was serious doubt that they'd take charter rights seriously.

so, i agree that there are major differences between canadian and american courts, but i don't think the comparison is unhelpful.",conservatives

i'd be interested to see data on any other jurisdiction that has taken on this sort of change. would property value actually decrease much if at all? we're not replacing like-for-like in a proposed massive rezoning.  

people who can't afford a detached house in vancouver (most people) would move into more affordable housing. that would appear to me to be a separate demand pipeline. those people were never going to afford a detached home anyway and weren't looking to buy one. if anything, my assumption would be that removing single unit dwellings would drive up the price of the remaining single units. 

property value would increase in that scenario, where either you are selling to a large developer for lots of $$$ based on the overall income they can generate from making your house into a townhouse/condo, or your selling the increasingly scarce resource of a detached home.

the only way i see prices dropping for homeowners is if the new developments actually negatively impact the neighborhood, which i don't think is much of a risk.
