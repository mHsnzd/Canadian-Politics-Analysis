it's not something you can disagree on unless you wish to deny historical facts. the ccf (forerunner of the ndp) was a [christian socialist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j._s._woodsworth)that advanced the rights of the poor, as were the christian socialist and christian democrat parties that set up the scandinavian model in places like sweden and norway; christian socialism led the way on forcing the state to accept gay marriage. compare that the anti-religious atheistic, homphobic  socialism of stalin, mao,  ho chi minh, and pol pot. it's pretty clear which one is the progressive force in the world.

\\&gt; is prejudice against strict moral ideas, such as those of the major religions, unacceptably intolerant?

it is when it leads to people running over muslims in the street.

\\&gt; do you think your comments reflect an anti-conservative prejudice?

no. conservatives always oppose progressive policies and are the last to accept them, whether they are religious or not. again, that's just a fact.

i have yet to see anybody or any news outlet blaming french canadians for this... all of the criticism is ultimately directed at the government of canada -- at the state, the nation. the catholic church too, but let's not forget that: 

a) they're christianity's and probably the entire world's biggest organized religion with blood already all over their hands 
and 
b) that lots of anglo-canadians are also catholic; it's not at all uncommon for people with german, irish, scottish, or italian background -- all of which are some of the biggest ethnic groups in the country still today.

not sure what headlines you've been reading, but again, i've yet to see a single one specifically directed at quebec and/or french-canadians. all i've seen are either directed at the church, or the nation, and by far and large they're directed at the latter. but maybe you're one of those quebecois who lives with a persecution complex.",liberals

but, perhaps more problematic for this argument is that it assumes, inexplicably, that a cpc or hypothetical party forming government would somehow be incapable of creating such a law without the law already being on the books. as pm they would be more than capable doing so, and using it to whatever horrible ends you might imagine. if anything, if you paid any attention to the sort of things the trump administration got up to, its clear that many political and even legal norms have very little strength if someone is willing to bull on through them and no one is willing, or capable, of standing up to them. 

this of course goes back to my first point: don't elect people who will abuse power, because nothing is going to stop them from abusing power in the first place.",liberals

gs1o96r,2021-03-23T23:33:04.000-07:00,"np: majority of canadians are feeling politically homeless, poll finds i don't think our relatively small size is an argument to not do enough - it's not conducive to credibility on the world stage. future growth in emissions is mostly going to come from developing countries as they increase the size of their middle classes, and with us having mostly developed, we need to take a leadership role and accept that we can't have developed ourselves and then tell other countries that they can't develop to the same standard of living simply because they came late to the party.

i do agree that what we are doing is not enough, but i think these things have to be done incrementally and with majority agreement. activism and polarizing debate has not really got us anywhere, even though it feels good. on the carbon tax, i am glad that something concrete is in place and that it has a long-term trajectory that people can plan around.

the approach to carbon emissions has shifted in the last 5 years or so from having less focus on conservation and severe emissions reductions and more on capture and sequestration of constrained emissions. who knows if that will be possible on a large scale, but i think that the global warming advocates got tired of being criticized for flying around the world in their private jets and living in big mansions sucking down resources simply to keep the lights on, so the channel has been changed to one that is more permissive of consumption, balanced with offsets and sequestration.

however, this position is also more practical when you look at the trajectory of the issue - when have emissions ever come close to targets? and we're told this is urgent. this approach still requires us to keep a lid on emissions, which is what the carbon tax hopes to enable.

if climate change was seen as a critical issue by the majority, we might see o'toole do what boris johnson gambled with in the uk around brexit - that is, to strip the dissenting conservative members of their entitlement to run in the next election and replace them with people who were onside with the new program. it is starting to feel like that kind of situation to me, but it would be a very un-canadian thing to do.

a couple of reasons he wouldn't do this:

* the hard right is stronger in canada (particularly in the west) and more liable to fragment the conservative vote than it is in the uk.
* climate change is not seen by the majority of canadians to be as critical an existential issue as was brexit in the uk.",conservatives

hc14xpo,2021-09-07T16:49:17.000-07:00,"gun control advocates unimpressed with o'toole's policy change on liberal gun ban i agree that addressing the root causes, (specifically poverty) is important, but it's all too often short-formed to \"let's make more opportunities for teens living in low socioeconomic conditions by helping them access jobs\".

i work with youth from different backgrounds, but i would guesstimate that around half have a criminal record. this would prevent them from getting a job.

the other issue is that when i've asked whether a teen/young adult that gets remanded to my work from jail if they want to look for employment or enroll in school or other training, the answer is usually \"nah, i make more money selling drugs.\" or a similar answer.

i have a feeling that very few would choose to bust their ass at wendy's or mcdonald's over the lucrative freelance work of selling drugs/robbing people/trafficking women. that is if those industries would overlook criminal records.

tl;dr - there isn't an easy answer. cutting or privatizing public services won't help. a focus on community policing and greater access to mental health help, and addictions help would go a long way to reduce crime in general.",conservatives
hc15gwc,2021-09-07T16:56:27.000-07:00,"gun control advocates unimpressed with o'toole's policy change on liberal gun ban well my reasoning behind putting semi-autos in restricted isn’t so much about the registration and atcs, and more about the increased training, storage requirements, and background checks that come with it. i do think there is a practical or realpolitik effect of having the increased friction of going through the hoops to legally own one having an impact on total ownership numbers, which would have a real safety effect of reducing the number of available rifles accessible to be stolen. it’s a deterrent so to speak, but it’s also truly about having more agency and insight on who’s owning these weapons and the data in which to tackle illegal weapons issues. we didn’t get rid of the registry for restricted weapons so there’s probably a good reason. 

restricted license holders don’t go around shooting people; i can’t even find a recent instance of a restricted license holder committing a violent gun crime, so there’s something there that’s working with the restricted system that we should leverage. handguns are the top, and semi-autos are the second most used class of weapon, both making up for nearly all gun related violence, and sporting rifles taking up a minuscule portion of that, so putting our two biggest offenders in restricted is purely based of evidence.

the atc is simply a hack using our existing system to continue to allow people who want to hunt with semi autos to continue to do so since currently you cannot hunt with restricted weapons. a modification to the existing atc system would allow the rcmp to selectively allow semi-auto rifles for hunting but continue to deny currently existing restricted weapons such as handguns for these purposes without having a major overhaul of the restricted category; it’s just a low overhead approach to the problem. we could bring back some semi-auto rifles that have been previously banned and allow them for hunting and target shooting use as well since we wouldn’t be populating the unrestricted category with rifles that fit that risk profile previously mentioned.

also full disclosure: i too am a left leaning gun owner. i think canada’s gun control system is really not that bad and the unrestricted/restricted category system makes sense. just a few tweaks need to be done and it could be done without totally pissing off both sides. 

if you think i’m totally off base here or this wouldn’t work, please, tell me your opinion.",conservatives
