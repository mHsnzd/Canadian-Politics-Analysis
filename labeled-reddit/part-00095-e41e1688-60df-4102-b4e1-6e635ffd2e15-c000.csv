2) deficit. the money printing isn't true, it's money printing or deficit, you don't need both. the government thinks that eventually cerb will create enough jobs in the future to balance out inflation (imo that won't happen soon enough and the problem is that there was such a big deficit cerb couldn't be funded by a deficit and cerb was funded mostly by money printing).

which is factually incorrect. they refused produce a report and to transfer documents in the 2020 ontario case. also, the attorney general (or as you put it in your highly partisan and completely fabricated attack, \"trudeau\") didn't sue anybody, they were the [defendants in that case](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2020/2020onsc366/2020onsc366.html#_toc30344548). they simply responded in a manner they obviously thought was consistent with the previous supreme court of canada ruling which, despite their disagreement with, they are still bound by.

and if you were to actually read the rest of my comment (and maybe the article you linked and the one it links to) you'd notice that that is addressed, and what you're saying is still completely misleading because you are simply trying to push a narrative instead of trying to objectively present the situation.

i'm looking into australia's system.  it's different from our own, but i\"m not 100% sure how it works quite yet.

our election isn't a single election, it's 338 elections.  the liberals don't lead the vote in each and every riding.  those that have the ndp in the lead would still have the ndp in the lead.  i think a lot more people would be willing to put ndp first as well (like myself) as strategic voting would no longer be needed.

i don't think you can cite a single country as proof of what becomes of a particular voting structure.  i advcoate for proportional representation all the time, and people constantly refute it with examples of countries with proportional representation where it \"leads to bad results\".   most commonly cited examples i've gotten are israel and italy.  but there are a lot of countries with proportional representation, and it's wrong to say that individual countries with poor governments can have those governments traced directly to proportional representation.

likewise, a country that uses ranked ballots, i don't think is right to say ranked ballots cause their issues.

ranked ballots are a step in fixing the election system.   they eliminate (or strongly remove) strategic voting, which i think is a very important thing to do.  i would take that over not changing anything at all.

the fact is, if we are going to get a change in our election system, it's going to come from the liberals.  i would prefer they went to proportional, but i'm done with our current system, personally.",liberals

and do you know what happens when the ndp are leading the liberals and cpc 40% to 35% to 20%? those 20% cpc votes go to the liberals. now sure the ndp will win some seats. but as a trend across 338 seats? it will benefit the liberals significantly. more than they benefit now. 

and over time those less seats mean less power. it means less resources as their is less chances to win and get donations as people don't think they can win.

do you know why we only use one country as an example for irv? because australia is literally the only country who uses it for their parliament. the reason israel is a bad example is because they use pure closed list pr. which no one is recommending. and there are also dozens of examples of countries who use other proportional systems without much issue. 

and it is fair to say ranked ballots causes the 2-party system. because we can go look at their elections and see how the system leads to the results. it is mathmatically verifiable. and experts have. it is why experts recommend against irv. it is what they told the committee for the report. it will statistically favor the liberals. they have the data to back it up.

ranked ballots doesn't eliminate strategic voting. it forces voters to vote strategically. the ridings where the ndp are 3rd place will still be 3rd place. but now they are forced to pick between liberals and cpc anyways and then told that this means they support the liberals because they like the cpc even less.",liberals

they engaged in the entire committee process in bad faith, and engaged canadians in bad faith through their loaded survey. and in the end, all we learned was that the liberals never wanted to work with the other parties and only wanted ranked ballots.

he said there was one incident of him in blackface,  as a grown adult. then a second video showed up, and he didn't want to confirm if there was more.

hbtc5o0,2021-09-06T00:56:58.000-07:00,"voters should look carefully before swapping trudeau for o’toole ok, i hear you.  but i think your last paragraph sort of proves my point.  trudeau is good looking and successful, which can be triggering for some men.

to your first point about obama, clinton, and jfk, i would argue that the us is different than canada in the sense that they tend to admire people with star power, whereas in canada we have tall poppy syndrome and tend to tear down anyone who stands out.

i completely agree with your point about wealth inequality increasing in the last 6 years, but i think it's important to remember that this is happening world wide, not just in canada.  trudeau can't exactly control global markets.  however, i think the liberals have tried to minimize the wealth gap by increasing social supports, such as the child tax credit and the affordable daycare program.  these initiatives help to keep the middle class afloat.

i completely understand the anger and resentment that young people are feeling, especially in the face of rising housing costs (i feel a little of that too sometimes).  but, the blame is misplaced if you think that trudeau is responsible for global market forces.",liberals

hbtcsc1,2021-09-06T01:01:39.000-07:00,"the poll thread - monday, september 6, 2021 something i did not realize before, but when the discussion around electoral reform and possible pr was going on, [the cpc wanted a referendum to happen](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/electoral-reform-election-2019-1.5304383)

their official position was that they did not favour any one of the possible voting systems in particular, but they insisted it should be a referendum (which is the most appropriate in my opinion, as the entire purpose of having electoral reform was to try to reflect the will of voters in a more fair and accurate manner anyways)

in fact, trudeau and the lpc alone were the ones who ruled out a referendum, ruled our proportional representation and killed the whole thing, simply saying that a new system hadn't been chosen.

in the future, they were only open to other voting systems than proportional representation.  even *the bq* were in favour of the referendum, who arguably have the most to lose in a pr system of voting. 

i think it goes without saying why the lpc was against pr and a referendum, but to me it sure hurts their image if the cpc and the bq were willing to have a referendum, especially because *the lpc were the ones who promised change in the first place*. i guess that change was limited to what they deemed acceptable and couldn't possibly be given to voters as a whole to decide.",liberals

\\- he then refused to allow an investigation into his own actions of sexually assaulting her

\\- his excuse for blackface? \"i grew up too rich to realize it was racist\"

\\- he mocked the handicapped man who was asking him to keep his campaign promise; \"you're asking for more than we can give\"

\\- he gave millions of taxpayers $ sole-sourced to a charity that employed his mother and brother, without sending it to tender

\\- he ordered his attorney general to produce his desired results at the snc investigation, and when she refused to lie, he first kicked her out of the cabinet and then kicked her out of the party

\\- while prime minister, he accepted paid personal vacations for he and his family to the private resort of a billionaire lobbyist

\\- he openly and strongly defended a sexual predator, whom seven people came forward to accuse of sexually harassing four women (one so badly she attempted suicide, another so badly she filed a human rights complaint)... why did he defend the predator? because he didn't want to lose the seat, which was considered a safe riding for the liberals.

as a leader he's been hit and miss, but overall i feel he's done a reasonable job especially when faced with a very diffiicult crisis and difficult choices (not to mention a very, very difficult trump admin).  i do appreciate that he's typically pretty measured in what he does, even when he had a majority and could have pushed through almost anything.  he doesn't seem hardline about anything which i find to be a quintessential canadian quality, even if i would like him to be more urgent on issues like climate.

the trudeau hate i see on social media seems to mostly be reflexive.  like some some deep-ingrained value that is assumed to be a given, and from even before he became pm.  sort of like the reaction you'll get to \"socialism\" from a us conservative.  it's automatic, and not likely to change for any reason because there is not a lot of reason for it to begin with.",liberals

the resentment towards trudeau is more related to the economic conditions in canada.

while i agree wealth inequality and housing prices prices has increased world wide, canada has had one of the worst increases and the government hasn’t really done much to minimize the gap. remember that just a few weeks before the election, the liberals voted against the conservative housing motion without even bothering to draft their own alternative motion to be less partisan.

if canada was at least doing better than the us when it comes to housing prices, most canadians would be satisfied. however, our housing prices are much higher than the states and the housing increases are amongst the highest in the world. 

with the economic policies, the liberals have been artificially propping up the homeowners in expense of people who do not own homes who are usually lower income. inflation impacts people who do not own assets far more than asset owners.  increases in housing also increase rents in canada which are also amongst the highest worldwide. you wrote about daycare but for a lot of young people, they do not even feel financially stable enough with housing situation to even consider having children. if your definition of middle-class is people who own homes, then yes the liberal party’s economic and social policies have helped to keep the middle-class afloat at the expense of the lower-class.",liberals

&gt;even with this favourable interpretation of their policies, the ndp’s aggressive ghg target and unwillingness to give a break to trade-exposed industries (even in the absence of globalized carbon tariffs) results in a significant reduction of industrial output and employment, especially among the trade unions that tend to support the ndp. it’s hard to imagine that an ndp government would implement such a policy. but if it were to, the gtech modelling reveals an implicit carbon price approaching $500 with a major gdp loss of 6.5 per cent in 2030. an ambitious target combined with economically inefficient policies is devastating to the economy.

it is, of course, completely appropriate to worry about the economic impacts of environmental policy, but that's a different worry than whether or not the policy will have the desired environmental impact. 

as for myself, i've been listening to economists claim that even the mildest left-wing policies will completely destroy the economy as they cheer on policies that have lead to a completely unaffordable gigafied economy that is hurtling towards an environmental disaster. so, it's a bit hard for me take an economist seriously when they claim that this or that will have a negative impact on the economy.",liberals

really wish singh would've brought his platform to ontario where it's the appropriate jurisdiction for much of it rather than treating canadians like idiots. but then he's got plenty of supporters on reddit that make grand displays of not understanding the mechanics and jurisdictions of governance in canada on a daily basis so i'm sure that will work out for them as their war chest is at a historic low for the party going into an election they don't want simply because they can't afford it due to lack of fundraising support, in part because the leader keeps maintaining a platform which is constitutionally unfeasible and a base that treats canadians as idiots as much as the party leadership does.

well, there are two points to this:

the first is that there's a difference between debt for investment and debt for consumption.  using deficits to finance cerb or daycare or pharmacare might be very, very good things, but they're not the kind of asset that provides a \"return on investment\" that's a clear win.  you have to make some intricate economic assumptions to argue that a fairer economy is in fact a bigger economy (with more tax revenue at the same rates, providing said return on investment).

the second point, however, is more fundamental: there's a difference between good policy and popular policy.  despite deficit spending since the 2008 recession, we've failed to take the opportunity to make real investments of the kind that might be worth it, such as high-speed rail in the windsor-montreal corridor or serious levels of government-funded research or transformational energy investments (small nuclear reactors, huge renewable farms, your choice).  

some of this has to come down to the political environment, and it doesn't seem to be a popular call to pay money now for projects that won't provide benefits for years.  we also sacrifice a lot of flexibility at the altar of national unity; we can't drop $100bn on ontario without making equivalent investments in quebec, the atlantic provinces, a prairie province to be named later, and so on.

&gt;referring to a country which was a product of colonial construction as genocidal, when it was created as a mash-up of several adversarial ethnic groups that were simply pasted together because of colonial structures, undermines the understanding of genocide. were conditions for ethnic violence a result of colonial oppression? almost certainly yes. so we see the labelling of rwanda as a genocidal country, without the necessary framing of the colonial structure that provided this environment for this to flourish, as genocidal is a rule 3 violation. there is a lot of nuance when dealing with these subjects and we expect our users to explain this distinction when making over-arching statements that entire country's are genocidal.",conservatives

here is an example of a company working on a 10 minute ev battery swap.  i concede that you have to be using the company’s own proprietary batteries, but this gives an indication of how easy it can be.  

i don’t know why you’d think swapping an ic would be easier than an ic battery, so let’s compare.  you mention cooling, for an ev battery that is probably a fan into the battery compartment, but for an ic you’re draining the rad and then dealing with a bunch of hose clamp connections (plus there’s also a fan). you mention the complex controller, well for an ev battery that is one wiring harness whereas most ics will have a minimum of half a dozen wiring harnesses and often more.  not sure what the point about packaging is.  with an ic you’re also de-coupling the tranny, power steering lines (plus dealing with the fluid), brake lines (plus dealing with the fluid), a/c, and on and on. the link below says that you can get your prius battery replaced by a company that will come and do it in your driveway for $1,000. 

although not all evs are designed with rapid battery replacement in mind, it would be an easy design change (remember the startup that can do it in 10mins).  no amount of design work could make an ic swap that trivial.

once i had a broken arm. they refused to x-ray me, said it was a sprain. i went back a week later when i still couldn't rotate it. 

one other time, days after the first time i ever made out with a girl, everytime i stood up i got a shooting pain in my abdomen . my friend said blue balls maybe, but it wasn't in my balls and ejactulation didn't fix it. i went into the emergency room. waited 4 hours. doctor stuck his finger in my ass and told me to take advil. pain went away the next day thankfully, but still no idea what it was. 

once after i peed, it would sting and blood would leak out. no blood with the pee, just blood after i felt the sting. i took a piss test, and i told my doctor 'look i was a virgin until i married, and so was my wife and we never had sex with anyone else after either, i do not have an sti, please test for something else', i said it at least 3 times, so no misunderstanding. they said 'got it'. days later the receptionist calls back and say 'congrats the test was negative', i'm like 'for what' 'sti's' they says. i'm like i already knew that! but by this point the problem went away. at best, my wife nicked me with a tooth (early into marriage, and that was still new to her) at worse, a tiny tiny kidney stone cut me on the way out. i haven't had kidney stones since. 

i get it sucks for the states to have really expensive health care, but at the same time i rather our health care have a profit motive and diagnosis me properly because they checked for issues aggressively, than do the half assed approach because it isn't in their budget.

as for biden, my point precisely is that within a capitalist economic framework, especially the united states where there is virtually no distinction anymore between corporate policy and public policy, the substantive change needed to save the environment or at least make it somewhat livable is impossible to achieve, or at the very least incredibly difficult. that is my point more broadly - we cannot achieve meaningful and effective climate protection under capitalism, because capitalism thrives on resource extraction which necessitates pollution, and it always will.",liberals

which is all fine and dandy, but if doing so hikes the prices of domestic resources, we're going to import from abroad. populations in ontario and quebec don't care where their fuels come from, they just want it as cheap as possible.

if we're going to go after emissions domestically, we must also enact equal penalties on imports.

i'm not sure how that would work with trade treaties though.

if you are in charge of targetting resources to fix a problem, and the problem is only happening in x part of the country, why would you want to be sending resources to y part of the country to address said problem?

&gt;it doesn't make sense to allow smaller countries like canada to emit more per capita than the u.s. or china just because they have fewer people

what if a country is the only country in the world to be able to manufacture x product that the entire world depends upon. but x product is very carbon intense. does it make sense to allow that country to emit more because it is an exclusive producer? this phenomenon can be perceived in our existing supply chains.

&gt;the agument that canada does not have to worry about its emissions because it is a small country and doesn't is self-serving and is just an excuse to do nothing.

no one is arguing that canada should not worry about its emissions. i'm a bit flabbergasted that that is what you managed to summarize through all this. the original comment pertained to including all north american countries into standards so that we change as a continent, therefore impacting emissions to a much further extent than if canada did it alone. integrating climate change solutions into our supply chains as a whole is a better solution than simply having a carbon tax.

an uninhabitable planet would lower our gdp even further.

&gt; if we considered canada's geography, we are a netcarbon sink. 

and if we consider the planet as a whole, we need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. since being neutral due to our forests isn’t enough. we need to reduce our emissions so we’re actively sinking carbon and reducing the damage. 

&gt; i find it odd this bill seems.to ignore that by focusing on aggregate emissions without natural carbon capture sources in the view this is a global thing- without also considering how miniscule our contribution is on a global scale. 

everyone needs to stop peeing in the pool. us included. 

&gt; if canada was to get to zero emissions, it would be more than made up for in the next two years by emerging economies.

these are not correlated and is patently false.
