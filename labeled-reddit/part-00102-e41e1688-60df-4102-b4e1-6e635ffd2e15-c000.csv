could you clarify where you're getting this from?

from what i gather, pretty much everyone including gladu is against coercive conversion practices involving those unable to give their own consent. however the bill also revokes the ability of anyone else to voluntarily consent to such. additionally, there have been concerns about how such a law could be used to attempt to criminalize pastoral discourse:

&gt; gladu said supporters of the petition want the government to narrow the definition of conversion therapy so it doesn’t exclude pastoral care and voluntarily sought counselling and prayer.

&gt; “this petition came forward from members of the faith community in sarnia-lambton who agree that no one should be forced to receive conversion therapy, but were concerned that the overly broad definition of conversion therapy would infringe upon their rights of religious freedom and freedom of speech,” she told the journal.

&gt; the government of canada website says the bill would not criminalize private conversations involving teachers, faith leaders and school and pastoral counsellors. gladu wants that included in the legislation.

&gt; “the liberals refused to amend the definition of conversion therapy to protect the freedoms of others, and the bill is currently in the senate for debate,” she said.

could you explain to me why the government should *not* amend the bill to enshrine this as a legal guarantee?",liberals

citing previous elections or school openings are not compelling to me, because schools host the most resilient of the population, and there’s likely no data from previous elections that can be useful here. 

the “fog of war” prevents us from having a clear understanding of what is safe and what isn’t. 

but what we know is that delta spreads even among the vaccinated, that we’re at the start of a delta surge, and that the elderly vaccinated get the least protections of vaccines of any age groups, and that the elderly vote more than the young. 

and if it turns out that the elderly are the least likely to employ novel voting methods, the probabilities are on the side of the election being a forum for at least one elderly contracting and subsequently dying of covid.

biden's overspending on relief is higher and the us is experiencing more inflation. canada's is still pretty bad and we're experiencing very bad inflation. but not as high as the us. 

our capital-based system is predicated on the idea of equivalent exchange, where the money received is approximately equal to the value of what was given in exchange (work, goods etc). a hat for a cat or a cat for a hat, but nothing for nothing. 

when you dump hundreds of billions (or trillions in the us case) of unearned dollars into that system, dollars for which no value was derived, you create a false economy and you badly upset that system. inflation is the predictable and inevitable result.",liberals

&gt; in the us social conservatives probably would not take seriously a woman, especially a woman of colour, even if she's on their side ...

alaska gov. &amp; later vp candidate sarah palin was a favourite of the religious right.

gov. nimrata \"nikki\" randhawa haley, the daughter of punjabi immigrants who was raised as a sikh, won two terms in south carolina.

although it depends what you mean by \"social conservative\" - the term is often used for two distinct groups, a) people who think abortion is heinously wrong and should at least be restricted, if not banned, and b) people who think multiculturalism is bad and it's important to restrict immigration in order to defend \"western values\" or (in some cases) to preserve the white majority in the population.

i'd consider:

- kenney and lewis as social conservatives in sense a) but not in sense b).

- gallant a social conservative in both senses a) and b).

- legault and bernier as social conservatives in sense b) but not in sense a).

- o'toole to not be a social conservative in either sense.

in fptp systems they often end up supporting the same parties because both are opposed to progressive/liberal policies, but they shouldn't be conflated.",conservatives

&gt; that ability to turn her natural enemies to mush remains ms. freeland’s signature talent as she moves closer to the top job. 

this brings something to mind for me:


when i briefly got to chat with chrystia freeland a few years ago, i had one question: given that our government has been selling military equipment to a misogynist dictatorship like saudi arabia, while applying sanctions to a developing democracy like iran - where women have greater rights, such as being allowed to drive - doesn't that contradict our values and interests?

her response to me was that she opposed those policies behind the scenes, and i remember being quite pleased to hear that at the time. now, in retrospect, i wonder how often she tells people that she secretly agrees with them despite publicly supporting everything trudeau does. heck, she might even be telling the truth every time she says it, but i'm willing to bet that she has told a *lot* of people, off the record, that she either opposes or doesn't fully support current government policy.

i would like to think she's being sincere, and that her coronation will bring about significant change but it's probably naive to think her premiership would lead to anything other than continuity of the status quo.",liberals

to this day, china hasnt been stopped, chinese economic rise has only continued. eu trade with china still climb. africa and south america continues to enjoy chinese investments unhindered. central asia is falling to china now with the us military withdrawal, and russia-china relationship is warming because the us pushed to isolate china. japan and korea are still sitting on the fence and mindng their own business. nothing has changed for the better.

so, while you love taking damage for the us, what do you have to show for it? short answer is, nothing.",liberals

what i don't understand is the blind willingness to attribute it to the ndp when every other program has been amended, extended, or altered with the public service and stakeholder input as the driver. there's no evidence to suggest anything otherwise. it's literally just something jagmeet kept saying and people starting believing. trudeau is on the record pre cerb saying we had to act now, decisively, and figure it out later. that's what they did and what they showed they did by fucking up a few things at first but changing them to be right.

h3xq78t,2021-07-03T03:00:50.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] and government involvement in healthcare is a conservative plank? look, conservatives like the invisible hand to do its thing, and it is working beautifully for those who own a home. for everyone else, they get a invisible slap in the face, but the markets are technically working. so i do not see how conservatives wish to solve this without increasing government involvement in another industry. 

but lets say the federal government throws money at the problem. what are the federal governments paying for? redevelopment? new developments? with new developments, are they going to help cities cover the costs of supporting new neighborhoods? probably not.

first you need to understand, new neighborhoods do not pay themselves off for a couple of decades. the city, town has to plan how to provide services like garbage, water, police, fire etc. not cheap. you can offload some of the cost onto the developers, but that increases the cost of homes. usually it is older neighborhoods covering the costs of new developments over decades. it is a huge problem in fast growing cities which usually causes cities to increase property taxes to support new developments (if they happen too fast). 

the more affordable and sustainable root would be to encourage densification of older neighborhoods. the city of calgary is attempt this but is getting a lot of push back from community associations who want nothing to ever change. you have to fight nimbyism. this is were the provinces can get involved and force cities and towns to develop plans which promote densification and discourage dedensification. 

from personal experience (maybe you know a different group of conservatives), conservative mla and city councilors have been against pushing denisification let alone getting involved. in fact, they seem to not have any thoughtful plan on urban development and leave the problem to cities. the provinces can help, but they do not as it might lead to political suicide. conservatives seem to encourage new developments over redevelopments from experience. so conservative \"rezoning\"  would solve one problem while create a couple of new ones.",conservatives

the 2000s saw a hard swing right, purging the quebec/ontario/atlantic and moderate mulroney and clark conservative old guard. it didn't help that the provincial parties collapsed in the same timeframe. the old ontario machine was discredited, after the fall of mike harris, and atlantic canadas, a former rich area for pc votes, were driven out of the party by the reform/harperite crown as well. a generation of women were run out of the party as soon as they reached leadership positions: deborah grey, belinda stronach, and last but not least rona ambrose.

the party needs another purge and another decade to rebuild all the bridges, in ontario, in quebec and in the atlantic provinces that have been burned in the past decade. they need to accept that women can be part of their leadership and not sabotage them at every opportunity. they need to build bridges to the immigrant and minority communities as well: the benches of the conservative parties are overwhelmingly male, white and protestant, particularly on the front rows. they've got a lot of work to do.",conservatives

(i'll ignore indigenous mps for this point, they tend to be distributed more evenly with the bias towards smaller cities and rural areas. read \"minority\" as \"visible minority\" as the government defines it.)

as a point of comparison, let's look at 2011, which was a very different dynamic from this year. harper's 2011 caucus had 40% more mps, but had over twice the minority representation. why? because there were less total seats, and he did very well in the suburbs. similarly, the ndp had 14/103 minorities in the orange wave, which is higher than the proportion right now of 3/25.

meanwhile, the liberals, supposedly the party of choice for immigrants, had a pitiful two minority members in 2011 - hedy fry and ted hsu - of 32.

it's very common for the rights of one group of individuals to bump into the rights of another. so our law addresses that. it basically looks for the lowest level of infringement to resolve the issue. 

this is the often incorrectly quoted horribly misunderstood and only somewhat accurate 'you can't yell fire in a theatre\" point. you have the right to free speech - up to the point where your right interferes with someone else's right to life and security. in such a case, the right to life would be seen as being more important and more of an infringement so the right to free speech is infringed on instead. 

in the case at hand - driving a vehicle in a reckless and dangerous manner infringes on the rights of others to life and security. infringing on your right to require you to drive at a lower speed is a lesser infringement than someone else being in serious danger of losing their life. 

with regards to passports, for it to be reasonable the argument has to be made that allowing people who are unvaxxed to intermingle with others who are vaxxed somehow represents a violation of other people's rights that are so aggregious that the trampling of the unvaxxed rights is the lesser of the two. 

i personally seriously question that it is.  but - that's the bar it must meet and it's really not complicated at all as far as how you choose.",liberals

the specific dog whistle i was calling out was that there are \"deserving poor\" and \"undeserving poor\". because, when we create a barrier to re-entry to society you instill despair into the population which leads right back into the better-worse cycle most people find themselves in in that situation. 

the issue is more complex than good and bad canadians (having actually done direct support of both children and adults in multiple capacities at a social work level). the issue is that when you make anti-poverty programs gatekept, you end up criminalizing poverty which is so expensive. you end up with worse health outcomes which is so expensive (i don't just mean drugs, i mean things like pneumonia and frostbite etc). housing is a basic human need, and by criminalizing poverty without an eye to full cycle solutions, we're just spending time and resources ensuring the homeless population only grows. we've been trying the \"good canadians get help, bad ones get almost nothing\" approach for literally decades and doubling down on it at this point is basically leaning into a feeling rather than a fact. 

if we were being smart we'd be investing into the population we have rather than outsourcing that to other countries. i live in the cheapest 2 bedroom apartment in my city, and if my wife and i were working for minimum wage it would take 55% of our take home pay combined. 

at this point,we've disproven the welfare queens time and time again. in my province, the \"undeserving poor\" who can't work (like my brother, who is autistic, or my late mother in law who had fasd and schizophrenia) get approximately $600 a month. basic one bedrooms are 1000, rooms are $600-800. the system is just broken and it's not efficient as we spent billions on policing that would be unnecessary if people had actual places to live and were given access to proper mental healthcare and their medications.",conservatives

but for all of its faults, the cpc does not demonize immigrants. erin o'toole has never attacked canadian democracy, and it is hard to imagine him supporting something like the 1/6/2021 terrorist attack on the capitol buildings. and the cpc has helped prevent the emergence of a trump style party in canada. it is the conservatives that deprived bernier of his seat in 2019. kenney flirted with an anti-lockdown politics, and at times the federal cpc seemed to consider it, but the cpc hasn't pushed conspiracy theories about covid-19.

that doesn't mean it is impossible for the cpc to move in that direction. trost is closer to being a trump-style republican, though any party is likely to contain some members who represent extreme variations of its ideology. though trost actually replaced an even worse mp (jim pankiw). and the cpc membership came very close to nominating maxime bernier in 2017 and leslyn lewis in 2020.  

still, i think it's useful to talk about the cpc as it is, instead of demonizing it for being something that it is actually fighting. i know many of us have the fantasy of the old pc party coming back. but that might simply open the door for an actual trump-style party to emerge on a wave of anger.",conservatives

disallowance is a bit of a pandora's box situation that nobody really wants to touch at the federal level because of the legal and political battles that would likely follow. indeed, i'm sure that legault's opinion on disallowance is \"bring it on,\" because it would allow him to launch legal challenges to better define the scope of if disallowance is still applicable in this case and additionally it would unite opinion behind him allowing for an even harder line against the federal government. barring legault, or any premier, deciding to print their own money a la alberta social credit in the 1930s, we won't see disallowance.

this i agree with. of course trudeau has done some good things but compared to what he promised us, both in policy and the type of person he'd be as prime minister, he's definitely disappointed. so he can call us cynical if he wants but he's the one who made us feel that way.

that being said, gurney is a conservative (as he's admitted and presumably is why the rest of the article is whining about guns) so i'm not sure why he's pretending to care about trudeau's lack of progressiveness. the policies the left wants aren't things he'd support anyway so, while i agree to a certain extent, i am suspicious of his motives.",liberals

this was the big difference i was missing.   quebec doesn't seem to allow fired without cause...or more accurately they handle it very differently, end result is similar but i'm not sure there is an established english translation for the process (in a way that it is commonly available and understandable).  i also don't really expect the news  breaking article to be the one to explain it (the differences are quite nuanced and the poor translation (which is a huge disservice to quebecois who listen to english media but is good enough for roc) covers it well enough for now)...i fully expect a few articles   and interviews explaining these  differences next week but those haven't happened yet.

the complaint from the ndp is that despite all of the \"sunny ways\" rhetoric coming from the liberal party, there really hasn't been any radical change in the policies coming from the government. there have been small changes here and there, but nothing crazy. even while legalizing cannabis, it was done in a very pro-business way, and the government has been really slow to pardon people with past convictions haunting them.",liberals

[trudeau never really shook the election call issue](https://mobile.twitter.com/davidcoletto/status/1439739195866636289)

&gt; calling this election in the first place has made it harder for the liberals to connect with more than half the electorate.

[people expect the lpc win](https://mobile.twitter.com/davidcoletto/status/1439696450636627968)

&gt; but the possibility of a cpc win does move switchers to the lpc - problem? few think cpc is actually going to win.

&gt;more want a liberal gov't than a conservative one, but few want a majority either way... fragmentation is high, higher than any point since 1997.

another reason why the lpc might not want to be ahead in the polls since people would rather vote another way than give them a majority

but it really is a hell of an attitude from canadians that we simultaneously deserve hundreds of billions of dollars in net transfers from alberta over the years, but they don't deserve our help in this recent downturn.

how about we send just 25% of the net transfers back to alberta? i'm sure they could do with $100-200b of money back, and we would still have collected several hundreds of billions of dollars from them over the years.

of course we won't do that; we like their money too much. but have some sense of perspective. we are benefiting from alberta, not the other way around. if alberta was part of the us they'd have all the pipelines they could dream of, and all the guns and republicans too. in a concrete example, if alberta opts out of cpp - something they have the right to do, like every province - it will immediately raise all of the rest of canada's cpp rates by a pretty significant amount, because alberta is also a big net contributor to cpp.

the cold reality is that if canada said \"we're cancelling your equalization payments, but you also no longer get any federal services\" - what do you think alberta would say? something along the lines of \"great!\"

alberta could have the exact same tax regime it has today and also have one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds if they didn't send hundreds of billions of dollars of net equalization to other provinces for the last 60 years.

things are not always as they seem. i have a problem with a few progressive opinions. i'm voting cpc next election but it has nothing to do with their energy/environment stance.   
as a matter of fact, my industry is directly reliant on the o&amp;g industry for petroleum products and i still support the shift towards nuclear/renewables.  


agreed that 100% renewable is end-game goal, but unfortunately not feasible at the current point in time.   
that's why i called nuclear the best \"possible\" route. only because wws simply can't meet/maintain our current consumption. we just plain don't have the storage or the grids for it. 

nuclear would ideally be the bridge between o&amp;g and 100% renewable, while the tech advances. but some people with their heads in the sand can't come to grips with the fact it is impossible for us to make the 100% transition to renewable as of yet. 

really it comes down to nuclear vs. o&amp;g and pick the lesser of the two evils. because one or both **will** be required to spearhead us into the 100% renewable path.",conservatives

* ndp point out how it leaves may of the most valuable canadians out and how 10% is not nearly enough, it should be at least 75%.
