&gt; an office created to oversee the acquisition of new jet fighters is pressing the department of national defence to start afresh on its f-35 lightning purchase and consider whether canada needs to buy a different plane.

&gt; it's not an option the military or the prime minister's office relish discussing publicly as ottawa refines its strategy for dealing with fallout from the auditor-general's hard-hitting report on the $25-billion purchase.

[...]

&gt; the harper government promised on april 3 to hit the reset button on the f-35 purchase, but much of a seven-point plan it unveiled to address criticisms in the auditor-general's spring 2012 report amount to ensuring it has clear cost information and sharing it with canadians.

then, when opposition parties (yes, not just the cpc) tried to look further into it, the government released documents that they were forced to... except they:

* did the redactions themselves, instead of letting the independent committee law clerk do them

* claimed that the law clerk did the redactions

then they **shut down parliament for an entire month during the worst financial and health crisis the country has faced in nearly a century** to avoid accountability.

gnsmb6s,2021-02-17T02:53:03.000-08:00,"john ivison: erin o'toole must triangulate on federal carbon tax i read that eric grenier article when it was posted a week ago, and actually thought that it was not particularly convincing at that time.

i have no issue with the facts and graphs and figures - they do indeed show that at this moment ab does provide a disproportionate share of dollars to the cpc when compared to provincial population.  beyond that the article does suggest that:

* if the cpc tweaked their platform a bit to appeal to non ab voters it is likely they would lose some support (votes and $) in ab - i agree
* because the cpc typically wins ab seats with large margins, they could afford to lose some ab support and probably not lose any ab seats - i agree

so now the question becomes if the cpc trades some ab votes for some non ab votes, will they actually lose $?  or, in other words, are ab cpc donors more generous with their dollars than (eg) on cpc voters?  on this the grenier article doesn't really say anything.

i had a look at the 2019 election results.  in that election the cpc earned 6.23 million votes.  of those 1.44 million (23%) came from ab and 2.28 million (37%) came from on.  the other information i provided was from 2020 (so not a direct comparison), but interesting to note that 44% of cpc donations come from on.  to me that says that trading some ab voters for some on voters might not actually affect $ at all, while it stands a non-zero chance of increasing the crucial seat count numbers.

and on other thing to consider is this:  does the political party with the largest budget actually achieve the largest seat count?  iow, would the cpc really fare worse if they 'had to' get by with a smaller budget?  what, exactly, is that money buying?  maybe the cpc would increase their vote totals if they 'had to' get by with fewer advertisements.",conservatives

what is the threshold to get funding?  and how does someone get to that threshold?  does ~~madmax~~ max bernier and the ppc get the same funding as the green party?   

&gt; my point in general is that parties spend so much money on campaigning, advertising, etc. what for? we could save so much money if they just stopped doing those things. 

we don't actually spend that much in comparison with other countries,  campaigning is important as it raises awareness,  i would argue a big problem is campaigning has taken a centralized approach in the last 20 years where everything is focused on the party leader, instead of on issues and how those issues would be addressed.   without campaigning how do you engage with those who are not politically engaged regularly?  campaigning allows opposition parties a chance to actually challenge the incumbent which has a huge advantage in the ability to spend tax payer money on initiatives leading up to an election that help secure votes. 

&gt; why not have a centralized website with sections dedicated to each party? the parties can post a bit about themselves and their platform. then it's canadians' responsibility to visit the site and inform themselves. maybe have sub pages dedicated to each mp so they can write a bit about themselves. 

that is basically facebook, people can do that already.   i ask you in the last election did you look at each mp(p) in your ridings page?  my wife has voted ndp the last 3 ontario provincial elections,  she doesn't know who andrea horwath is by name, she knows that her picture is the party leader and that is it.  she votes with her union recommendation more than from a personally researched point of view,  this isn't uncommon at all. 

and i again would ask what threshold someone needs to reach to be allowed on the website to get equal representation about a riding?  does a first time independent get the same visibility as an incumbent? and the same funding?

&gt;  something like that would only cost a few thousand dollars to do. 

far more than that just from a opsec point of view, beyond the massive costs in bandwidth and peak loads during the election.    managing over 300 individual pages isn't a intern level of management. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; politicians can still have social media accounts, and they can still join publicly funded town hall / televised debates. right now it feels like parties are spending so much money just to **inform about/advertise** themselves.

and the process seems to have worked for the last 50+ years. it just seems that the process didnt include talking to past subordinate employees about the workplace environment but evidently that hadnt been a problem yet. but that doesn't mean the existing process wasn't already rigorous.

also, this issue of workplace treatment is itself new. only nowadays in 2020 is it a mainstream opinion that employees have rights and should be treated properly. so, in that respect updating this gg review process to include this consideration is really just updating it to keep up with changing cultural norms. i don't think it's surprising that this presumably was not part of the review process before.",liberals

i can agree with this sentiment. it is easier to divide along already existing social fault lines than it is to create brand new outrage.

&gt;you can focus on the pest at hand or go look at the root. if china &amp; russia can so easily destabilize and provoke violence in the west this says much more about us then it does them.

well no one is claiming that these societal problems aren't already present, they exist in every nation. but at the same time we must be cognizant that these fault lines are being exploited as much as possible by nations which do not support five eyes, nato, or other nations which go against their interests.

should we ignore these threats until it is too late? [csis is already aware of the ongoing threat,](https://www.csis.org/features/countering-russian-chinese-influence-activities) so the only question is how long will they maintain the status quo before they feel actions are necessary for national security reasons.

&gt;when people marched on parliament calling trudeau a communist, when the anti maskers came and yelled at police to arrest the \" traitor\" trudeau there was nothing foreign about that. 

hmm i would disagree. you can not make that claim unless you know something we don't? i would not doubt that foreign interference led to the radicalization of some canadians, such as with canadian-born [isis members](https://globalnews.ca/news/7299184/woman-arrested-toronto-trying-to-join-isis/) or the recent [incel attack](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54895219). online radicalization is a potent force, and i would not doubt that we have not seen the last of these individuals who are radicalized by social media.

i believe foreign interference is much more prevalent than we think it is. the only reason why we don't notice is because these actors aren't exactly honest about their intentions, nor do they broadcast their efforts loudly.

&gt;like many other problems the west projects onto its enemies this a problem of their own making. i ain't no trudeau fan but you don't see me ramming into his gate.

no doubt you are much more aware of these issues than most, therefore you are probably not as susceptible to online radicalization as others. however, while the west has problems, let us not pretend that these things aren't happening. csis even admits that online radicalization is a problem, and i am inclined to believe the canadian intelligence agency myself.

gkuh0h9,2021-01-26T01:44:41.000-08:00,"lynn beyak announces her retirement from the senate i know that the nature of the senate doesn't need unanimity, but i was using it as the most obvious example from the constitution. 

imagine if anyone else but the british parliament created this rule. if the prime minister at the time, pierre trudeau, simply decreed that the senate's existence would require all provinces and the commons to cancel, and those provinces and the commons didn't provide such agreement to this limit? it would be a politician creating a rule that is deliberately designed such that their successor cannot get rid of it just as easily as they made the rule. same with how the senate was easy to amend, just get a majority of the house of commons and the house of lords to vote for it, after 1911, it would be the commons alone in the uk, to amend the rule just like how easily they made the rule. but all of a sudden, the existence of this entrenched senate was made without the approval of as many provinces as it took to make the senate.

i know that constitutions are supposed to be hard to amend, but you still need the amending formula to be based on something the people can realistically alter. ireland is another westminster country like us, and it adopted it's current constitution, which requires a majority vote in a plebiscite to amend as part of its rules, and was adopted by a majority vote in a plebiscite in 1937.

this is common around the world. in france, the constitution of the fifth french republic was adopted by a majority vote in a referendum and it can itself be amended by majority vote there or by 3/5 votes in both houses of the french parliament. this is supposed to be obvious but somehow it isn't. 

the fixed election date does limit the gg's powers by forcing them to issue writs for a given date, it's just that it's also possible for the gg to issue them at other times. it also probably has constitutional implications given that the governor general had the privilege to dissolve the parliament on their own decision but now is bound by mere statutory law. 

the prime minister can be clearly bound to do things by statutory law. if they were a doctor they couldn't share medical information about their patients to the governor general (which seems like a weird example but it applies in other ways too, such as the security briefs which the pm is entitled to have but not necessarily others have, and so the pm cannot share it with others based on statutes prohibiting such conduct). all the statutes i'm thinking about here are going to do is to make it so that the information the prime minister knows is embargoed, and that they can't tell others nor can others tell it to others on the pm's behalf, leaving the gg in the dark except for what advice the advisory committee on senators could tell them.",liberals

gmlmzm8,2021-02-08T01:23:15.000-08:00,"let's talk immigration. &gt;substantial integration and assimilation only occur amongst second generations, and strong identification with canada mostly begins with third generations.

[polls don't actually suggest this is true, at least for **naturalized citizens**](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/immigrants-the-proudest-canadians-poll-suggests-1.1225782):

&gt;*whatever canada is doing, it seems to be positively influencing immigrants' views of the country, the survey suggests: __88 per cent of respondents who were born outside canada said they were very proud to be canadian, compared with 81 per cent of those born here.__*

those who have become citizens are proud to be so. it is something they had to earn. ***civic nationalism*** is strong.


&gt;we cannot consider ourselves a native english, and native french, speaking country when the native speakers are on decline. 

[the most recent censuses would seem to suggest this isn't a problem.](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/as-sa/98-314-x/98-314-x2011001-eng.cfm#a3). to quote:

&gt;*outside quebec, the share of the population with english as mother tongue remained relatively unchanged, going from 73.3% in 2006 to 73.1% in 2011.*

&gt;*the proportion of the population reporting french as a mother tongue in canada declined between 2006 and 2011 from 22.1% to 21.7%. however, this decrease is smaller than what would have been expected given the volume and composition of international immigration during the period 2006 to 2011, in particular immigrants with a mother tongue other than english or french.*

&gt;*while canada is increasingly diversified linguistically, its two official languages—french and, to a greater extent, english—exert a strong pull as languages of convergence and integration into canadian society, especially as languages of work, education and the provision of government services to the public.*

&gt;*canada's linguistic duality is reflected in the fact that 98% of its population reported that it was able to conduct a conversation in either english or french. similarly, either english or french are spoken at least on a regular basis at home in canada by 94% of the population. these two languages are used most often at home by 89% of the population. the same situation was observed in the 2006 census of population.*

it seems immigrants integrate extremely well into canadian society and language rates are very stable. the vast majority of the population uses english or french at home. i don't think your fears are actually born out by the statistics we have currently available.

&gt;why are there special loans, and scholarships, for certain races?


i personally don't like it, but it is specifically allowed under the charter right after the section which guarantees equality rights:


&gt;*subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.*

it gives constitutional protection for any affirmative action program for the protected grounds listed.


&gt;this problem is compounded when population growth is entirely driven by immigration


a big problem is that without immigration we have a shrinking population, and a aging one. a poor combination, and one which leads to serious economic decline. government uses skilled immigration to counteract this problem, which is nothing new.

canada invented the idea of a points based immigration system in the 1960s. we started using immigration policy to drive economic expansion in the early 1900s when we used it to populate the western provinces. immigrants have ***always*** been about 15% to 20% of the population. our first prime minister was born in glasgow, scotland. most immigrants came from the british isles until the early 20th century. you had waves of migration from eastern europe to the west in the early 1900s. next you would get people like my great grandfather arriving shortly after the first world war from italy, and others from southern europe. the next waves arrived from eastern europe again after world war 2 and it slowly shifted to asia. today the majority come from india, china and the philippines. immigration has always been a part of canadian history, and a tool used by government, which gears it toward the current needs of the country. it is a tradition that goes back over 120 years to the times of wilfred laurier. 


if the cpc wants to win, we need to embrace the conservative immigrant communities which exist in places in the ***suburbs*** of major urban centres. for example, doug ford's riding is 70 visible minorities, mainly easy asian. he won over 50% of the vote there. downtown areas of places like toronto are a lost cause. however, there is an inherent conservatism in suburbs of many, many cities. they are sick of high taxes on the middle glasses and ridiculous, socially progressive policies. they want fiscal constraint. taking a nativist attitude will let the liberals paint us into a fatal corner though.",liberals

absolutely true.

i did indicate that i thought the probability of a crisis is not high, so i'm not thinking about a normal election call, or the normal passing of legislation in a minority government.  the two scenarios that i'm thinking about are the equivalent of the harper prorogue incident, and also, form just this past 2019 election this idea that the party with the most seats gets the opportunity to form government.

yes, we have the cj, so technically we are covered - there is a person to make the call.  yet we also have the fact that the harper prorogue was atypical and did create a fair amount of hand wringing, but still completely legitimate.  do we really want emotional people to have extra cause for hyperbole and exaggeration and disingenuous claims of an illegitimate process?  or assume there is an election and trudeau falls short of a majority but this time the cpc gets x more seats than the lpc.  clearly the ball is in trudeau's court to decide if he wants to try to test the confidence of the house.  do we really want emotional people to have extra cause for hyperbole and exaggeration and disingenuous claims of an illegitimate process?

under the 1997 supreme court decision, first nations in bc still have aboriginal title - basically, they're the landowners. but canadian law still applies!

besides the courts, the other avenue is politics, but the 2019 federal election appears to have settled the issue. [gary mason](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-a-pipeline-fight-with-quebec-may-be-looming/) interviewed john horgan shortly after the election:

&gt; there are a couple of things that struck me about my conversation with the b.c. premier. the first is his apparent resignation that the trans mountain expansion will go ahead. while his government certainly poked sticks in the wheels of the project in an effort to thwart its progress, his words now suggest it’s too far along to stop.

trudeau does not select appointees based on merit or qualifications. diversity is the only qualification you need. 

tbh, if he wanted an astronaut that people could deal with and was diplomatic, chris hadfield was far more qualified and his demonstrated his ability to deal with people individually and in large groups. but he’s just a straight white male. payette was already well known as a bitter shrewish thug to deal with. anyone in ottawa who dealt with her knew that. the subordinates, from the space agency who complained made it well known. 

i know employment at the cbc isn’t chosen by trudeau but cbc has the same mindset. when they chose to replace peter mansbridge with four poc, they unconsciously shut that it took four minorities to do one mans work. and the national is now just a jumble of mishmashed “reporting” if you want to call it that. 

look at the appointment of judges by trudeau. same thing except there is a lot of liberal cronyism involved. we’re you aware to be appointed as a judge in many canadian (not criminal courts) you don’t even need a background in law. immigration courts are the biggest dumping ground for unqualified judges. hell some of these “judges” have been pretty corrupt and they were appointed by both parties.",liberals

gj6z97w,2021-01-13T12:00:40.000-08:00,"u.s and them — january 13, 2021 as far as the social idea of free speech though i think it frequently comes down to competing speech. it very much is a zero-sum thing, because something being \"socially censored\" is really just one position being massively less popular. if something becomes so unpopular its being pushed out of the overton window then there i don't see an inherent way around that.

fundamentally i feel like almost all of this is some people equating free speech with respectability. but the free speech right to make a claim doesn't include the right for the claim to be considered a respectable position, because whether the latter is true is really just a matter of *other* people right to speech.

as you identified, it gets tricky with massive platforms, because they have a huge amount of influence, but i'm not sure this situation is actually that complicated, or even unprecedented. pre-internet we lived in a world with more highly editorialized media, and that fact didn't prevent people for pushing for social change, so things becoming a bit more editorialized now won't either. furthermore, it's still much cheaper to create your own twitter competitor now than it would be to create a competing broadcast news network then, and that you might not be able to have amazon host it still doesn't change that.

but tons of minorities have been able to advocate for themselves while at an inherent disadvantage due to their size. the rest of society is *always* massive to us. it's just the nature of being a minority. we didn't get acceptance handed to us. we had to put in the work, and we still have to. so me seeing all these right wingers expressing concerns about the free speech implications bothers me a little bit.

at the end of the day i feel like there's no way around the issue of influence beyond \"if you're concerned that society might consider you speech abhorrent you *have* to convince other people that it's not\", and if you fail you fail. that goes to social conservatives and everyone else, and if it ends up that twitter starts trying to censure my own speech i'll have to do the same thing; advocate for myself and convince other people to do the same. there simply *isn't* another option.

no, there's nothing \"unscientific\" about that. see, again, you are using that as code for \"i disagree\". you can't do any sort of assessment without an objective function. pretending that your objective function is \"objective\" and \"scientific\" is lieing to yourself, plain and simple. you have an objective function, and someone else has another objective function. there's nothing scientific about one objective function vs another.

how do you \"objectively\" measure an 80 year old losing their life vs a 20 year old? hint, there isn't a way. it's not a scientific process. yes, qaly's exist, but there's no reason why that's inherently \"right\". i could just as easily claim that each life lost is worth the same. everyone interjects their own morality into this. you are fooling yourself to believe otherwise.

&gt;prisoners aren't being vaccinated as part of a moral crusade.

ok? that as nothing to do with science.

&gt;once you accept that stopping the spread of the virus is a worthwhile goal

again, nothing to do with science. science measures the impacts or perhaps measures what is possible. establishing the objective function is not a scientific endevour, and the quicker you understand that, the quicker you stop harming the definition of \"science\". 

i could say \"i don't want any vaccines to be given out, because i hope everyone who is old dies.\" there's nothing \"anti-science\" about that.",conservatives

our hydrogen strategy is just another part of the larger parcel of what is effectively climate denial. we may very well need hydrogen as part of a transition strategy, but just like natural gas, the moment you see fossil fuel companies perk up their ears and applaud 'climate action' like this you should be wary. when they're on board, it's usually a sign we shouldn't be.",liberals

indigenous people are *still* suffering from the actions of our government from 150 years ago, 50 years ago, 25 years ago, and even today. because we aren’t a medieval or crusading society anymore, and we no longer believe in the “white man’s burden”, it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to right the wrongs we’ve made in the past, especially if they still have palpable consequences.

 if the government really was going to treat all canadians equally they would take heed of the concerns of indigenous people to the same extent they heed the concerns of albertans or quebeckers.",liberals

canada has a major china-problem, and it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with ideology. western politicians fear to say anything about china, ignorant to the fact that china itself is a multi-ethnic (albeit widely assimilated) nation. 

our nation is in bed with a fascist han-supremacist regime that indoctrinates its people with false renditions of history, a nation that persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, a nation that infringes on the land and seas of other nations, a nation that is actively implementing economic imperialism throughout the world.

australia and the netherlands publish their data on this, as all childhood transition runs through their national health care programs. guess what percentage of kids on puberty blockers go on to transition as an adult?

if you guessed \"80%\", too low, try again. 90%? still too low. it's about 95% in australia, and 97% in the netherlands.
