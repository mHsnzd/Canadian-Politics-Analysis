similarly, the actual position of the governor general is a creation of royal prerogative, so the \"office of the governor general\" can only refer to the powers and privileges granted by the constitution to an individual carrying out the government of canada on behalf and in the name of the queen (which is the definition of \"governor general\" in the constitution and throughout canadian law, which is why the provisions apply equally to the administrator right now).

any interpretation of \"office\" which doesn't include the powers and rights accorded to that office is incompatible with canada's constitutional structure. of course, there are powers which are granted or limited by ordinary statute which are within the powers of parliament/the appropriate legislature, and there are concurrent powers held by parliament, like the ability to legislate a process for non-prerogative pardons, but the fundamental powers and rights of the office such as promulgating laws, issuing orders-in-council, appointing executive officers, etc... can't be changed without resorting to section 41.",liberals

and powers must logically be able to be amended by the parliament alone, like the ability to restrict dissolution of parliament because the parliament of canada itself is able to amend the executive and legislative branches, actually the house of commons can do it alone without the senate if the senate waits six months without assenting, and powers like restricting the dissolution power and appointment power would fall under that. the governor general actually has to propose money bills, but that would clearly be something that the parliament could amend alone as it only is about the federal government and the way it internally works and is not about the relations between the provinces and the feds or the basic idea of judicial review or human rights or a less partisan head of state. ministers alone can appoint people to positions, not even the governor general has to sign some of them, and advance search minister and appoint in the advance search function under just acts and you will find there must be the power for people other than the gg to appoint people because ministers can appoint some people directly.",liberals

what it looked like: \"we promise a 25% drop in prices\"

what they actually said (approximately) \"we promise these plans back in 2015/2016 in the 2-6 gb range will be lowered as new plans people can easily switch too.\"

the carriers completely came through.  plans that were $65-$85 for 1-3gb are now $25/1gb and $35/3gb through the flankers. 10gb was $15-$200, and now it's $50.  data overages were replaced with throttled data. that's one heck of a drop.

the problem is, they made the ask to weirdly specific.

prices per gb have shot way down, but the end user prices are still very high, so people just ignore all the progress we made.

then the mvno debacle and other anti-consumer started peeking out of the crtc, making it look very bad.

the main thing about québec politics, is that there is the normal right-left spectrum, but then there is also the federalist-separatist and the multiculturalist-nationalist spectra. québec in general is quite nationalist, but not necessarily separatist (relative to the past). politically, left-right wise the politics of the populous are probably somewhere around the pq and the liberals, but on the question of independence and nationalism, the caq is officially not separatist but they are nationalist. as such, they can shave off more conservative plq voters as they aren't separatist, but they can also shave off a number of pq voters because they are nationalist.

fiscally speaking the province is in much worse shape than in 2018, with the latest projections not showing anywhere near a balanced budget within the next decade - even with planned austerity measures. so the only way they can cut taxes - which i’m sure they’ll do - without putting the province in a bigger hole is by raising taxes and fees elsewhere.

also the pandemic has aged the ford government much faster than normal, seeing the province so active in the lives of people is bound to make voters think hard about another mandate. 

however, the pc’s have managed to amass a big war chest, and with a weakened liberal party and a very left-wing ndp serving as opposition, they still have good odds of winning. 

in terms of the ndp, i’m not sure what they hope to gain by attacking del duca right now of all times. nobody is really paying attention to politics with the re-opening going on, and the attack ad gives easy ammunition to the liberals to hit the horwath with during the campaign on how she was more focused on him than holding ford accountable.",liberals

however, the us has weaker arrival rules than canada, and has parts of the country that risk being hotbeds of covid and thus hotbeds of variant development.  both those reasons are both reasons that re-opening with the states needs to be negotiated.  for example, at least we need to know how much the us is doing to detect new variants, and make a plan to slam the border shut if any new concerns are detected.  and that negotiation takes time.",liberals

&gt; look at wilson-raybould for a good example of what working as an independent while generally aligned with liberal principles looks like.

the difference here is that she became independent after a massive public scandal that got her media attention and the public largely took her side. and even with those elements in her favour, she barely held onto her seat as an independent and she may lose it in the next election as the media coverage is over and voters' short term memories kick in and constituents vote for their usual party.

they're pro-capitalist, pro-corporate and anti worker's rights - see the huge upwards wealth transfer in the pandemic through the cews and the strike busting legislation they've brought twice as examples. they're also aggressively pro free trade, which is considered part of centre-right ideology. their only real climate policy is a carbon tax which is a pro-market conservative plan. they continue to subsidize corporations and the oil industry while opposing any sort of wealth tax or tax on high earners or corporations, indicating that they want to maintain the class structure. they also don't seem to have any interest in expanding ei beyond the pandemic, improving the social welfare of vulnerable people like those with disabilities or in ltc, or implementing any sort programs such as pharmacare or dental care to improve things. i know they have their childcare program supposedly planned but i think anyone who isn't a die-hard liberal knows that is a promise meant to entice left-wing votes (because the liberals campaign as if they are centre-left) but not something they will actually do. on foreign policy, they are pro-israel, just like the tories, and continue to sell arms both to israel and saudi arabia, despite promises to stop. 

obviously their spending prior to covid was not part of a rw ideology but, aside from that one thing, they really don't have policies that are much different from tories. imo there's little daylight between trudeau and harper except that trudeau is better at talking like a progressive and has better pr.",liberals

the media has successfully convinced many women that they are oppressed/second-class, that we live in a patriarchy, that there is a glass ceiling, that there is a gender wage gap etc., and this influences women to vote for economically interventionist parties and not to trust free markets or small government. they have also convinced women that the conservatives are out to control women's bodies and that criminalizing abortion would be the first item on the agenda (which is not the case obviously). that is why the media and the other parties play it up so much, and why every single conservative leader tries to denounce social conservatism. also, unfortunately, most canadians are more aware of american politics and society than canadian politics through the media and they associate conservatives with republicans, who do actively try to limit abortion and are actually socially conservative.

there has been far too much abuse of judicial discretion when it comes to sentencing already and this has been reflected in numerous polls where canadians think sentencing is too lenient. https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/crime/rr01\\_1/p2\\_1.html

courts are also subject to the confidence of the public just like everyone else and yet there are almost no paths for the canadian public to properly exert what should be considered appropriate sentencing in these matters. mandatory minimums instituted by the parliament would seem like reasonable ways to make sure judges are sentencing within what the canadian public at large considers a minimum standard of punishment for the crime. but now the court seems to be trying to say that they are some higher power that feels that they know what is more societally appropriate punishment than society at large. judicial activism at it's worst in my opinion.",liberals

a liberal minister changing the rules in the middle of an ongoing investigation into a recent2ly conservative-appointed deputy minister would be the epitome of innappropriate political interference. the civil service, investigations, and judicial procedures are all supposed to be absolutely independent of political interference. so yes, intefering politically to change the rules in the middle of an ongoing investigation would have been totally inappropriate and sajjan would have had to resign if he tried that. 

&gt; leaving those rules in place compromises the investigation so long as vance is the cds.

that is absolutely true as well. so saajan stepped into this with harper's rules in place and with harper's guy in place. snookered. if he changes the rules with harper's guy in place, vance gets off because he's not given due process. if he doesn't, the whole system remains in the chaos he found it in.  the fact that is now entered the realm of a criminal investigation outside the military vindicates sajjan's decision to let the investigation take its course. someone under vance had a lot of guts to break the chain of command, take some initiative and do the right thing.

&gt;you car try and make cars more environmentally efficient but your not going to get rid of them outside of a major city like toronto anytime soon.

the goal isn’t to get rid of them, it’s to eliminate them from your day to day commute due to extremely negative consequences of using cars as a form of mass transit, they take up far too much space relative to how much people they transport, their emissions pollute cities and the noise generated by them is why so many people thinking cities are loud, among a billion other reasons.

regardless, you don’t need massive urban centres to support mass transit. there’s tons of low cost options to choose from such as light rail and trams, and a population in the low hundreds of thousands is usually enough to support a really solid transit network.

i think that the western sahara situation is abominable and i say so whenever that topic arises or makes the news or i am reminded of it. but that doesn't occur that often. 

moreover, criticizing morocco's behaviour is totally acceptable in virtually all sectors of society aside from those in which moroccan nationalists or pan-arabists form a majority.

on the other hand, i see evidence of israel's malfeasance regularly and i also see disproportionate effort from media and politicians and others to excuse or support it and to actively silence and harm people who speak about it.

on a tangential note, re something that is similar in some ways albeit dissimilar in other important ways, think about the attention to the probable attempt at a cultural genocide in china. china's actions (at least those that are well-documented) are not as bad as what the burmese military was doing to the rohingya nor as bad as what is happening to tigray people in ethiopia. the degree of attention it has been receiving, especially from farther-right conservatives who don't seem to mind anyone targeting muslims otherwise, is obviously politically motivated in many respects. but that doesn't mean that even what china admits to doing (e.g. putting people in camps bcuz beards) is cool, that it doesn't deserve attention, that we shouldn't talk about it, that it isn't a big deal, etc. and it does not mean that it is appropriate to go around demanding that anyone criticizing china's actions spend as much time criticizing ethiopia's.",conservatives

the greens committed a number of political missteps here, most notably paul not immediately addressing her advisor's comments. zatzman should have known far better than to say what he said - the heat of the moment overwhelmed his political instincts and it's likely that paul sympathized to the point where she was blind to the political calculus. to date she still has not said that she denounces his opinions. and the internal politicking of the green party being brought to light enlightened me on a few issues - i like the greens but i'm starting to understand that lack of party-wide discipline is what's keeping them from any significant leadership in parliament. 

paul's blizzard of press conferences in the following days did not help, as her accusations came down relatively quickly and were wide-ranging - accusing the pm of not being a feminist fell flat simply because there are so many competent and capable women in his cabinet, but also because it blindly ignored the agency of jenica atwin - blaming trudeau for her decision is pretty hypocritical. admittedly, her issues with the greens is inside baseball, but in her interview on the house, chris hall raised comments she made in a letter to the effect that she wouldn't touch atwin with a ten-foot pole. paul immediately shut down the conversation without so much as acknowledging the letter or its contents. very concerning. 

another interesting point here is that the liberals are classically much more pro-israel than the greens. if zatzman's comments were that offensive, why go to the liberals? 

as rosemary barton pointed out, this entire situation looks strongly like convenient cover provided by the liberals for atwin's defection. it is strange that the liberals have suffered zero fallout for this - indeed, trudeau's name really isn't even in the conversation besides paul's vitriol towards him. it gets even better for the liberals because it is conveniently hiding mumilaaq qaqqaq's *extremely* unsettling reasoning behind leaving parliament. 

paul was the leader of the party and chose (and will still choose) to run in a central toronto riding, against the guidance of her advisors. i recognize that she's in a rough spot as the first _____ to ever ______, but her decision-making doesn't really make her look like a politically savvy leader. the fact that party infighting has become public dirty laundry really does bolster that.

if we are trying to form a working theory of what is going on here, we have to examine possible explanations and figure out how likely they are.

let's say, for the sake of argument, that there is a non-zero background probability that criticism of a black jewish woman politician is motivated by animus towards at least one of those groups. i think that's a reasonable assumption. if we had no other plausible theories, then this could be our best guess.

however, we have extremely good evidence to believe another theory about what is  happening: that annamie paul has done a fairly bad job of leading her party and things are going to hell in a handbasket as a result.

we have mp atwin leaving for the liberals and saying that ms. paul wouldn't reply to her emails requesting support. we have ms. paul refusing to discipline a staffer who called for 2/3rds of her caucus to be unseated (!). we have the ongoing communications nightmare that is her refusing to do anything but angrily attack seemingly uninvolved people. we have the fact that a politically inexperienced person seems to expect the liberal party to save her by not accepting mp atwin as a liberal. 

we have leaked audio of meetings where she dismissed reports of edas threatening to deregister by saying she can afford to lose people because more and more are joining every day, which is arrogant and mistaken.

she's attacking chrystia freeland for being a token woman who's only there to make trudeau look feminist. this is some crazy shit.

so given all this other extremely good evidence for the view that she's underperforming to a degree not seen in a federal leader since *at least* stockwell day, (maybe some bloc supporters can chime in here, i don't know much about what happened after duceppe stepped down), it seems reasonable to dismiss this other explanation as less likely.

it's probably wrong to say that, from the perspective of the lpc, only the ndp's voice was responsible for shifting their mood. the leverage that the ndp wielded was that they made statements which were similar to the statements being made by many stakeholders across the country. the liberals could ignore the ndp's requests and deal with other parties, sure, but that would risk them looking incredibly stupid across organizations such as businesses and unions, and even just lay people who would eventually be the ones that need to use these programs. 

tbh though, i'm not sure if the ndp is the only party that called for these cerb modifications. they might've been the most vocal, but i could totally see the greens or blocs making these requests as well.",liberals

&gt;the government took heat from opposition parties and canadians who were left out under the initial rules, which said that in order to qualify for cerb, an individual must have lost all income for 14 consecutive days in the first month, followed by zero income for subsequent months.  
&gt;  
&gt;that omitted many students whose summer job plans are falling through, and people who are working reduced but regular hours. trudeau also has promised to make a change so that essential workers, such as those working in long-term care facilities, aren't financially disadvantaged by working instead of collecting cerb.  
&gt;  
&gt;the ndp, which had called for a universal $2,000 benefit, pushed for the expanded eligibility.

it's probably not solely the ndp that offered this criticism and that some credit should go to the other parties as well, but to say that the lpc wanted to do it anyways isn't supported by the evidence",liberals

&gt;it's such a strange argument: \"the government doesn't care about you, which is why they did something we said would be good.\"

how is that a strange argument? what purpose would, for example protesting, ever serve if a government didn't need to be dragged kicking and screaming to enact a desired legislation? the entire reason why governments do anything good for people is the fact that they have to face reelection eventually. toeing the line between acting in self interest and doing enough to make people want to vote for you again is pretty run of the mill politics. if you want more out of your government than the bare minimum, it takes a lot of effort",liberals

if you look at the insights west poll, wanting a change in government, voting against another party and voting against the liberals because they called an election (this actually was its own category) was all highest among *ndp*. 

so why is this significant? well for starters, the environment in bc is more likely to push this sentiment. covid cases and fires… an election probably wasn’t what you were thinking of. but i think there’s another significant factor that’s more significant to bc. 

the ndp have a presence here, and it’s a lot harder to convince voters to vote strategically for the lpc when the ndp start to become the dominant alternative to the cpc.

so it probably has gotten to a point where the scale tipped, and people jumped to the ndp (or even the cpc). the sentiment against the lpc as well as the ndp being a viable choice means it’s harder to convince voters to vote lpc. i’m curious if this would (or even will) be a factor in other regions where the ndp are a more viable choice.",liberals

this is the breakthrough the ndp should have been waiting &amp; preparing for - becoming the defacto non-cpc option they are provincially in the west but also on the federal level. i am very keen to see if they can make inroads in alberta, saskatchewan and manitoba as well (less keen on them picking up much east of that).",liberals

i have to take a bit of exception to this bit of analysis. there are so few ‘star’ candidates because the vast majority of seats that are available for liberals are not generally considered to be ‘safe’ seats - meaning that ‘star candidates’ are usually less inclined to roll the dice.

the examples mentioned in calgary and edmonton can be won, and probably face better odds of going liberal this year than they did in 2019, but it doesn’t mean that vips want to risk it. even ottawa centre, which is far safer than those two ridings, still requires *a lot* of hard work to keep.",liberals

a lot of my points still stand regarding carbon taxes and the priorities of liberal governments when it comes to subsidization and support for carbon-polluting industry. the biden administration for instance hasn't done anything substantial to reduce carbon emissions during his administration, nor has he reversed any of the trump-era cutbacks to environmental regulators, and has put his full support behind the continued practice of fracking. i will give him kudos for shutting down the keystone pipeline (i think it was that one anyway...), but other than that it has simply not been enough.

the same sorts of things ring true in countries everywhere from france to japan - governments that could be described as 'liberal' have not been taking decisive and collective action against climate change, specifically because it would require an acknowledgement that capitalism, their preferred economic and social system, has failed to self-regulate to the point of cataclysm. mechanisms like carbon pricing may mitigate pollution and force companies to internalize their externalities, but it will not come anywhere close to actually bringing emissions to a level that would avert the worst of the crisis. at this stage, the two options we have are to work collectively to bring pollution down to those levels at whatever cost, or just let it happen. anything less than a well coordinated highly ambitious plan will fail at this point.

as for the liberals in canada, if you still vote for them as a self-identified liberal, despite the fact that their policies are again insufficient for dealing with these issues, then you may not be affirming that you agree with their policies, but you are saying you at least tolerate them. in that sense, it calls to question how much you are against \"corrupt politics\" when you support their continuity via your party of choice.",liberals

thats your counter argument? your rational would include such takes as \"people trained exclusively to analyze specific system in a vacuum say that system is great\"

&gt;innovation is a partnership between private firms and governments. governments help train scientists, provide patent rights, allow for tax credits, but in major developed economies, private firms undertake the bulk of research and development.

to neoliberals, yea that's the optimal relationship. where companies are absolved of risk but stand everything to gain. again you're simply stating the nature of the system we live in. there are critiques about how and why things are done, not an objective retelling of said relationships. also i mean literally the first line in that link *\"global innovation is being driven and financed by firms whose priorities may not reflect those in wider society, writes dani rodrik, professor of international political economy at harvard university.\"*

&gt; who began writing the code to implement page's ideas. page came up with the idea, and unfortunately for hassan, he didn't stick around to reap the result of his work and skil

there are always idea people and implementation people. they are supposed to compliment each other, the value connection is so hilariously off base however. one needs the other.  

&gt; there is no free lunch - they have to monetize their efforts and as if targeted ads are what we get - then so be it

its funny because thats the kind of shit that gates used to (still does) say about software development, even though he directly benefited and learned via that collaborative sharing process 

&gt; carnegie didn't \"just\" make money off the backs of labourers.

i mean he did, he was a hypocrite for being a \"champion of the working man\" while hiring the pinkertons to smash skulls during the homestead strike, when workers were striking against wage cuts. he got into steel when he was already very wealthy, and while he clearly innovated, he also innovated the way many capitalists do, which is about reducing labour costs, safety conditions etc. he used insider connections to get many of the contracts that would continue to make him wealthy. but again, laborer's generate the value, without labours, whos building and smelting that steel? him?

&gt; the value of repetitive labor is commoditized, anyone can do it

all labour is skilled labour, the idea that ceo's or upper management is some unique ability beyond the factors of any other labour is a hilarious lie to justify a system of inequality. 

&gt; but they value of managing giant corporations or even small businesses is scarce. value, in part, is determined by scarcity if you can provide a skill others can't, you are getting paid.

scarcity can be artificial, considering ceo's have little impact on the overall well being of a company, they simply occupy a space. again you're discussing the system as it is, not as it should be. theres no reason things have to be a certain way, just because. most people who defend capitalism, dont do so as it being equitable, they simply protest that a vertical hierarchy is necessary (probably nothing to do with thats how they were raised and indoctrinatorated.)

&gt; i work in the financial service industry, at a canadian pension fund. i don't seek riches or lord over others, i just want to live a decent life.

but clearly your empathetic bubble doesnt extend very far

&gt; my parents lived under a marxist regime, and they would never willingly live in one again.

really, where was that? i'm curious which country's industry was owned by the workers? because i dont think you know what marxism is if you think anything resembling socialism has been implemented. but becareful how you look at prosperity, historically it has come at others expense, the british were prosperous, i wonder why...

&gt; does capitalism have problems? yes, as would any system created by flawed humans. but i haven't seen anyone invent a better system and i think history is living proof of that

capitalisms is the reason our planet is in this mess. the idea of an egalitarian system such as socialism or communism being somehow not better comes from a fundamental lack of knowledge on the subject. if you dont need to lord over others why defned a system that does? why defend a system that benefits our worst instincts as a means to an end? there is a reason ceo's are exponentially more likely to be sociopaths, the system rewards it. it prioritizes self interest above all else as a means to survival.",liberals

the author's other argument is that this is an american thing, not a canadian thing.  and while our federal elections have proven that currently, our electorate isn't as swayed by it as americans are, it'd be wrong to suggest such populist and divisive politics aren't gaining foothold here.  you can look at alberta, the prairies, or even rural ontario.   the rise of groups like ontario/canada proud.   the yellow jacket bullshit.   the discussion anytime native rights gets brought up.   yes, we've done a better job at fighting it, in part because i think we've had a good look at the shitshow that it's caused in the states, but that doesn't mean it's not a threat here.",conservatives

&gt;trudeau assured the support of new democrat mps by announcing tuesday that his government is extending the $2,000-a-month canada emergency response benefit for another eight weeks.

&gt;in return for extending the cerb, ndp spokesperson melanie richer said new democrat mps will vote in favour this evening of the supplementary spending estimates — some $87 billion in planned, primarily pandemic-related, government spending.

&gt;but the government made one key change, ensuring that unemployed canadians will receive $500 a week in benefits — the same as they’ve been receiving under the cerb — rather than the originally proposed $400.

&gt;singh had been adamant that the ndp would not support the throne speech if it did not first see legislation guaranteeing there’ll be no reduction in the benefits received by jobless canadians.
