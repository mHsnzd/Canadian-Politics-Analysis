&gt; but if a rebound to a pre-recession [employment] participation rate is to be the trigger for cutting back stimulus spending, the government has a problem, at least politically. the participation rate edged past its prepandemic level last october – and it blew past that mark in march to reach a 45-year high.

[…]

&gt; nevertheless, he says, the liberals seem intent on stimulating demand in the economy, even though there is every reason to believe that consumer spending will roar back as vaccination rates rise and health restrictions ease.

the situation ten years ago occurred through events *with-in* the economy. while the current situation was induced *from the outside*: the economy is/was put into a coma for health reasons, and not because things slowed down by themselves. this is the reason why in the us the cheques that were sent out should not be called \"stimulus\", but rather should be thought of as \"disaster relief\". the point of them isn't (shouldn't) be to get the economy going but rather for people to be able to survive until things can be opened again.

it is questionable whether any help will be needed to kick start demand to get things going, which is what keynes says is needed after a slow down. so it is questionable whether extra government spending will be needed in 2021 and 2022.

of course spending on infrastructure generally can be useful if things need to be replaced, and investment by government in the country is/can be a good thing, but that is separate from getting the economy going again.",liberals

however, tvo did do a great [article](https://www.tvo.org/article/why-accessing-medical-abortions-is-so-difficult-in-ontario) about this which covers some good points/examples. 

&gt;however, a recent globe and mail investigation found that doctors aren’t prescribing mifegymiso at the rate they could be: “in eight provinces where detailed data was available, at least 69 per cent of the 10,092 mifegymiso prescriptions dispensed last year came from abortion clinics located mainly in large urban centres. interviews with clinic employees, physicians, researchers and abortion-rights advocates across the country suggest that many primary-care providers avoid prescribing the abortion pill.” as a result, people often still have to travel to access a medical abortion.


________________
&gt;some medical professionals, though, are still reluctant to prescribe it. the globe and mail spoke to one alberta-based doctor who had to prescribe the drug after her normal clinic hours because her colleagues didn’t want to be connected to abortions. lyndsey butcher, executive director of the shore centre, in kitchener-waterloo, told the globe that wait times for mifegymiso can be from two to three weeks long because few area doctors will prescribe it.",conservatives

gziq7vk,2021-05-26T00:52:48.000-07:00,"belarus closing canadian embassy as pm trudeau condemns regime i do agree that one reason why hamas continues to be able to recruit new members and stay in power is because many palestinians feel that israel is giving them no choice... and they're not wrong, but also not wholly correct either.

we have a situation where one group of people live in a land where all their neighbours want them dead. they've had to fight hard and be the toughest, and have to continue to show no weakness or invite another invasion.

the other side was displaced from their lands by a foreign power (*not* israel), and wants their land back, and is attacking the people currently living on that land.

over the years, both sides in this conflict have struck painful blows and more deeply entrenched the feelings and desire to fight.

at this stage, both sides feel the other is the aggressor, both sides feel justified in attacking each other, etc.

i will note that israel absolutely has the capability to wipe out palestine completely and no one could stop them if they chose to do so. so in some respects, they're exercising restraint.

where your analogy breaks down is that there have been brokered peace agreements in the past. hamas and palestine aren't being completely ignored, and they have broken previous peace accords. 

all of which is to say... it's complicated. horribly complicated. to have peace, you need to be able to reach a compromise, and hamas has on many occasions stated that they will not rest until israel is wiped off the map... and it's hard to find a common ground and compromise with such a goal.",liberals

hj16meo,2021-11-02T03:04:36.000-07:00,"elections canada probed how many canadians have a 'conspiracy mindset' i disagree, and here's why:

* most conspiracies have origins - sometimes it's rumours getting out of hand but sometimes they are spread maliciously by bad actors - including foreign governments - to sow confusion and chaos, or achieve political goals.
* people aren't doing research and coming up with conspiracies themselves that question official narratives, they're being fed misinformation through social media platforms. we need to identify who is behind the theories and understand their goals - as well as how they're spreading through social media. is it ads? algorithms? p2p? their involvement in various organizations? their associations? did somebody sell their data? 
* there's a bit of a domino effect that goes on. people subscribe to one conspiracy, then another, then another, until they're steeped in bullshit. there's a whole alternative market for information that promotes the spread of wholesale misinformation through various channels. the irony is that the conspiracy theorists consider anybody who believes the official narrative to be mindless \"sheep\" when 99% of conspiracists are really just following different, less reliable, completely unaccountable shepherds who have lots of ideas but no real proof or evidence. again, people are spreading misinformation, they're not coming up with it themselves.  
* the \"intensity\" of the information can cause real danger. there's probably no real harm to believing the moon landings were faked, but there is a huge amount of harm believing that liberals are a bunch of pedophiles and child killers harvesting adrenochrome - like the guy who drove his truck through the gate at trudeau's residence believed, or the armed guy who was going to rescue the kids in the basement of that pizza shop that didn't even have a basement at the end of the day. gullibility plus guns plus paranoia is causing real deaths. look at all the deaths and injuries in dc because of the completely unproven \"stolen election\" conspiracy.  
* vaccine conspiracies are directly contributing to deaths and hospitalizations at a massive cost to society, to families and to the economy by dragging out the pandemic in all kinds of ways. also, people who have bought conspiracies about covid vaccines are way more likely to refuse other vaccines as well, with the result that we could be looking at a resurgence in polio, measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox, and all kinds of other nasty shit that we had pretty much eliminated thanks to enough people trusting in doctors and medical experts for herd immunity to work. 
* the loss in trust of our institutions - media, government, doctors and scientists - opens the door to all kinds insurgent behaviour, as well as making it impossible to get people to agree on one cohesive narrative. we're in an insane situation where conspiracists don't actually have to defend their theories or provide any evidence, people can say anything they want, but everybody else suddenly has to defend their facts and research and professions. people don't have to provide evidence of people being chipped with 5g transceivers, for example, but now society has to prove they aren't? the burden of proof has somehow fallen on the institutions that have been telling the truth all along - which we know for the simple reason that it would be impossible to keep these secrets among so many people. the sheer number of people who would need to keep their mouths shut for any of these conspiracies to exist is staggering and completely impossible.",liberals

the overall global stimulus levels are likely a secondary factor, with larger economies like the us giving free money to consumers who did not need it. those people are likely using that money to drive up demand for limited supply that is even more limited by the supply chain issues. the canadian stimulus being quite targeted would have a less significant, although non-zero, impact due to people using that money to cover their basic needs rather than expanding demand.

this is purely conjecture and doesn't appear to be based on fact - it's as if they expect people to have the memory of a gold fish and not remember the [railway blockades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_canadian_pipeline_and_railway_protests) from january to early march 2020 where virtually nothing was done by police to deal with the blockades? some examples from the news [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srw0df0njc0) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwhj_h6rkmw). they were essentially allowed to continue until they fizzled out. other than the rcmp action to break up the actual protests against the pipeline i haven't heard of anybody being arrested &amp; charged outside of bc for these sorts of protests when they were literally shutting down canadian infrastructure moving goods and people around the country for a couple months.

also we had quite large blm protests the summer of 2020 when we were in the second covid wave. trudeau even attended one himself [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-anti-racism-parliament-hill-1.5600803). rcmp weren't breaking those up, or the protests in support of palestine in toronto. you can look at the crowds [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/palestinian-protest-mississauga-1.6032005) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek99mkhkhyk). the rcmp weren't rushing in brutalizing people in either instance - even though they were in violation of provincial gathering limits at the time (blm ones were for sure, palestine ones i can't remember so well what the ontario restrictions were). so this narrative doesn't add up cbc is pushing here based on some people's opinion. you don't just get to pick and choose what protests you like and don't like otherwise you end up looking like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpbrvwe3xfk), a complete hypocrite.


&gt; in february 2020, after the rcmp enforced the second court injunction, removing the wetʼsuwetʼen blockades and arresting wetʼsuwetʼen land defenders, solidarity protests sprang up across canada. many were rail blockades, including one blockade near tyendinaga mohawk territory which halted traffic along a major canadian national railway (cnr) line between toronto and montreal and led to a shutdown of passenger rail service and rail freight operations in much of canada. the eastern ontario blockade was itself removed by the ontario provincial police. blockades and protests continued through march in bc, ontario and quebec. discussions between representatives of the wetʼsuwetʼen and the governments of canada and british columbia have led to a provisional agreement on the wetʼsuwetʼen land rights in the area. 

from another section of the wiki.

&gt; throughout february and march, solidarity protests and blockades were held across the world. most in-person actions were halted in mid-march due to the covid-19 pandemic, but online solidarity rallies continued.

&gt; on june 5, the bc prosecution service issued a statement saying that criminal contempt charges for 22 members of the wetʼsuwetʼen nation and their supporters would not be pursued. additionally, coastal gaslink issued a statement that they would not pursue civil contempt charges against the protesters.[32]",liberals

btw: what would it take for alberta to qualify? if its resource revenues fell to zero and its non-resource fiscal capacity declined 12% (to just below ontario’s level), then it would start to receive adjustment payments.
what happens if quebec electricity prices increase by 1 cent per kwh? its resource revenues increase significantly (hydro quebec produces well over 200 billion kwh of power per year, and this is a resource revenue). its equalization payments consequently fall to less than $12.3 billion. ontario, meanwhile, would qualify for $741 million in adjustment payments.

hi9iubr,2021-10-27T02:26:31.000-07:00,"elections alberta posted incorrect information on equalization referendum, law experts say they aren't the same rates, they produce the power at roughly the same costs. they also have to deal with mainland and island generation and distribution whereas quebec does not. this is a complicated and costly endeavor and there is a related increase in distribution costs. manitoba also produces hydro power through a mix of reservoir hydro and run of the river. they also have a larger portion of their power generated by natural gas and coal and end up with slightly higher rates than quebec with the larger costs involved in run of the river and fossil fuel electricity production.




it is not subsidized. no money is given to hydro quebec and it turns profit year over year. they also increase their prices every year to maintain a profit. it makes no sense to say how different jurisdictions have rates set if their systems and methods of generation are different. we don't compare our royalty rates to texas or alaska or nigeria or saudi arabia because we have some of the world's most expensive oil to produce and we feel that these costs should not be borne exclusively by the industry. this has a variety of causes, some of which are related to regulatory decisions, some of which are just inherent problems with oil sands, and some of which are because we just have greater concerns about catastrophic failures or safety than other governments. we also lower royalties so that industry can get back to investing in projects after the last 8 years of shit oil prices. quebec has cheaper electricity because it costs less, they are the texas to our oil industry. similar labour standards, different production costs. it is literally market forces at work; places that can produce something at a lower cost just do that. forcing quebecers to take a massive increase in electricity prices because other provinces can't generate electricity as cheaply as they can would go over about as well as the nep did in alberta.





honestly consider my question: why should quebecers pay through the nose for electricity that doesn't cost them as much money to produce? if so, should alberta intentionally throttle its oil companies by charging royalty rates that make it unaffordable to produce albertan oil? after all, other countries have x rate, why shouldn't alberta charge its correct rate?





asking these questions don't make sense because resource related industries inherently have these problems. that's why resource revenues are structured differently in the equalization formula. not because laurentian elites are out to pick the pockets of albertans, but because there's no good answer to \"what is the objectively correct price to charge for this resource?\" trudeau sr. thought he had the correct answer to that question when he brought about the nep. he was wrong. we would be wrong to force the same elsewhere.






edit: even if quebec was forcing consumers to pay electricity rates out of step with what it costs to generate power and turn a profit, they'd still be receiving equalization from the feds anyway, because they earn less on average than most canadians and have a corresponding lower tax base per capita.",liberals

hazskcs,2021-08-30T09:52:52.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] as i said in a similar thread the other day, if there is one thing the liberal party of canada excels at, it's winning elections. on that basis alone, i think the smart money is still on a lpc win.

having said that, i get the sense that the liberals are running their standard playbook in what is, by any measure, a very *non*-standard election. and i think that's going to hurt them.

first, there's the late-campaign platform drop. this worked for trudeau's liberals in previous elections, but i am not sure it's the right approach for this one. a year of lockdowns has habituated people into thinking that you need a pretty damn good reason just to walk out your front door. now the liberals are telling canadians that we must go to the polls two years early, in the midst of a fourth wave, because we have very serious issues which only a majority mandate will allow them to properly address.

okay, fine.

but if that's the story you're going to tell, people will quite understandably expect you to be ready on day one with a compelling plan addressing these very serious issues. in other words, *you need to have a platform*. and piecemeal policy announcements that don't obviously hang together around some coherent organizing principle or theme are no substitute, especially when they often appear reactive to what the other parties are proposing.

second, there's the fearmongering about the big blue bogeyman, with his (((secret agenda))) to privatize healthcare, criminalize abortion, and clear-cut old growth forests to make clubs to beat trans kids (or whatever). this has been standard liberal operating procedure at least since the martin era.

but here's the rub: if the stakes are really as high as the liberals *need us to believe they are* (because if we don't, a snap election becomes nothing more than a transparent power grab), then surely now is the worst possible time to risk putting the bogeyman in charge. in the absence of a platform or some other compelling narrative explaining why it was so damned important to have an election *right now*, ginning up fear of the tories is ultimately self-defeating, because you don't have an answer to the fundamental question: if they're so awful, why open the door for them two years ahead of schedule?",liberals

1. expropriation, of course its an option, but theres a difference between 5 $750 000 houses vs a railway owned by a $50 billion dollar company. you can bet that the cost just for buying that asset out from cp is in the 10s of billions because of their lost revenue. as a sidenote, when metrolinx buys properties like what they have to do for the ontario line, they normally sell it afterwards.

2. emminent domain. or saying \"were the government and were going to take this\" need i say more?

3. telling a private company how to run their company. so, like depending on where politically you stand on this, i doubt think many people support this. personally a private company should be left alone to run their own business. which brings me to my last point

4. previously owned government assets. just because it was owned by the government before, doesnt mean the government has a permanent right to that asset. the 407 was sold off 25 years ago, the government has no right to take back any control of it, any use of it is granted in good faith from the 407 company.

now of course as i said before metrolinx can ask to run trains on the tracks and cn/cp can say \"sure, we dont have any trains running between theese times, you can run your trains then\" which is what happens. for example on the milton, kitchener and richmond hill go line and weekends pre-covid running trains to niagara",liberals

at the end of the day yimby can be just as dangerous as nimby depending on the deal being struck, given my own interests i can draw examples from tiger conservation.

trying to shut down all logging, while appealing, would serve to alienate an impoverished rural community and likely push them towards poaching, the 'shut it all down' approach is just a non-starter. so instead you see them striking deals, getting the logging company to bulldoze up logging road entrances when they're done in an area, limiting the access of would-be poachers to otherwise fairly remote woods. or explaining how tigers on your hunting club land is a better alternative to wolves. that doesn't mean that harder edged actions are out of the question either as evidenced by a number of villages being extirpated from reserves that were being put together but these necessarily have to be the exception and not the rule.

i think the challenge with the environmental movement is that these negotiations are so far from their experience and understanding of most of the supporters so you get these mutually inflexible demands that rural place x can't participate in any economic development that might threaten wildlife while at the same time the same rural place demands that urban place y do without the transmission needed since it runs through their backyard. not helping things of course is that while wcs can talk to locals in russia or india and find them remarkably willing to help protect the fauna they take pride in we've made the entire idea of environmental protection much more of a political football in our own countries making these negotiations a hell of a lot harder.",liberals

(including the increased emphasis on environmental policy encouraged by the mulroney government)

**2006-2021:** the cpc and provincial parties influenced by them constantly demonize and misconstrue information regarding the carbon tax. it's eventually implemented in 2015 and both spend the next five years constantly trying to repeal it, even when their initiatives have backfired.

the main distinction here is that while the liberals and federal pc's were able to govern from the centre and evolve their policy positions based on the evidence and contemporary issues, the cpc has refused to change and increasingly been willing to choose increasingly idiotic hills to die on rather than evolve as a party. while anti-carbon tax sentiment might sell in western canada (even among some left wing voters here) it just make the cpc look backwards and polarizing everywhere else and hurts them during national elections.

if western canada doesn't like  them, then that it's fine, they can chose not to have carbon taxes, but the federal government can and will make up for their shortcomings by raising the difference for the jurisdiction themselves. the battle is lost, but so many conservative candidates still want to rile up discontent over it rather than addressing actual policy concerns.",liberals

personally imo i think if canada(every fed party atm) feels like we must* take in 400k people a year - there needs to be a federal program to help impacted municipalities and there must be development funding for undeveloped parts of canada. currently the feds set the numbers, stand back and let municipalities deal with the consequences.",liberals

you keep using that word. i do not think it means what you think it means.

missteps around procedure is not corruption. legislation that you disagree with is not corruption. look at governments around the world, and things that happen and you'll find actual corruption.

just because you don't like the government doesn't mean they are \"corrupt\". i absolutely hated the harper government, and i think it regressed canada back in big ways, but they certainly were not corrupt and lots of people on \"my side\" were throwing that word around back then a lot too.

scandals don't matter. they are noise. they are red meat for a drama hungry population. policies matter, legislation matters. i don't give a shit about scandals, and neither should you. they make absolutely no difference in our lives at the end of day, and legislation does. i'd rather elect someone whose legislative policies i agree with but who did some dumb shit, than someone who appears \"clean\" but wants to make laws that i don't agree with.",liberals

leger recently asked what people's second choice would be, actually, so we have some pretty good numbers on it. 

for liberal voters, their second choice is 51% ndp, 13% cpc, 6% bloc, 4% green, 1% for ppc

for cpc voters, 20% would vote lpc, 18% would vote ndp, 4% would vote for bloc, 4% would vote for greens. 13% would vote for ppc but nearly a quarter have no second choice.

for the ndp, 36% would vote lpc, 18% would vote green, 13% would vote cpc, 2% would vote bloc and 1% would vote ppc. 

for green voters (it should be noted that at this point the sample size is very small) 53% would vote ndp, 14% would vote lpc, 8% would vote cpc, 3% would vote bloc, 7% would vote ppc.

while the lpc would certainly benefit from ranked ballots, it's pretty clear from these numbers that the ndp would benefit from it as well because they're the second choice of many voters-- more than half of lpc and green voters, and nearly the same preposition of cpc voters would choose ndp as they would lpc they just wouldn't benefit nearly as much as they would under the mmp system.

you'll notice that there's a near linear rise in housing prices going back all the way to 2005. after trudeau is elected, there's a slightly steeper increase over 2016, followed by the price increase becoming more or less flat from early to mid 2017 to early to mid 2020. if you're going to blame trudeau for that slightly steeper increase over 2016, you've got to equally credit him for flattening the curve for most of this pre-pandemic term.",liberals

but i disagree with this:

&gt;but the worse problem is the senate isn\"t even elected. 

people only have so much stamina for elections. having a second tier just leads to obstruction. im not too familiar with our senate process but they did shoot down a homophobic bill in the past under mulroney, so they come in handy. i dont know the ideal system but i disagree with having them be elected.

the main problem i think people overlook with pr is that majority governments are good. majorities require broad support and they are much more effective at governing. so even though i disliked harper for example, the people on average were okay with him and he really wasn't that awful despite being bad imo. 

a pr system creates shaky coalitions that result in too much compromise and bickering. they also lend too much support to fringe movements like anti-vaxxers.

it's complicated and im open to a pr system i suppose but im still warry of it and it bothers me that people don't put much thought into it. 

its also insane that ndp supporters insist that trudeau should have passed it since he had a majority. yet that is a very undemocratic look, to just change our democratic election process because of their ability to do so. the cpc would have branded it as election rigging and the ndp was only willing to support the system that benefits them the most. i quite like ranked ballot, and i think it would benefit the ndp, but they shot it down for not being perfect and now they try to score cheap political points on this topic when they are partially responsible for the lack of movement on it. at least ranked ballot is not a drastic change.",liberals

trudeau was notified by our military early jan 2020 about the virus. he made feb about optics saying restrictions on travel to/from hot spots is racist. 

hajdu also said that travel restrictions don't work. 

in reality, closing international travel is the only thing that would have saved 2020.

our federal government did nothing. 

he didn't handle trump well because he was too scared to close border travel early on non essential travel for a week to allow for assessment. 

it's written in this self assessment report that canada took a 'passive' approach early on. it notes international travel restrictions were not implemented.

then regarding mulroney, don't be so sure you have the facts. paul lucas was the ceo of glaxosmithkline.   he actually praised mulroney and points issues with patents, changed under liberal government and it made canada less competitive.

he wrote this article to try and set the record straight. 

https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-why-were-not-doing-better-on-covid-vaccines

yes, there have been governments after that didn't fix things. but trudeau is our pm now. and he legalized weed as his priority.   it certainly wasn't updating the ppe equipment the expired 3 years before harper left. trudeau has had 6 years at the helm. 

he also points out they have been making vaccines in canada for years. but trudeau never came to them. he did waste 3 months with china though.  after that it was a scramble to acquire, and not produce domestically. 

if anyone is  really happy with the job trudeau has done, i doubt they have a grasp of what happened at the start of 2020.  opening the flood gates put all the big provinces in a losing place. 

even now, health canada reported 640 of 44,089 international travellers tested positive between feb. 22 and march 15.

&gt;  
&gt; [prime minister justin trudeau](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-feds-passed-over-private-option-with-plans-to-produce-covid-19-vaccine/) initially said the nrc facility would be up and running by november 2020 and producing 250,000 doses a month. however, in early february, trudeau admitted that the [nrc plant wouldn’t be ready until the summer of 2021](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canadas-vaccine-procurement-efforts-have-been-shrouded-in-unjustified/), and with the need to outfit the facility for the novavax vaccine and subsequent health canada inspections, there won’t be any vaccine coming from there until the end of 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;the failure of the cansino deal and the delay in building the new nrc facility left canada reliant on foreign sources of vaccine. the contracts for the vaccine were negotiated based on advice provided by the [18 member covid-19 vaccine task force](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/corporate/covid-19-vaccine-task-force) set up by the nrc in june 2020.

my biggest concern is that the $200bn he speaks would place our national debt at a point where we could no longer service it based on our gdp. meaning we pay everything we can towards interest and the clock keeps increasing. 

after a $1 trillion pandemic spend, we need to get back towards sustaining the programs we cherish as canadians or will lose them.  if there are loopholes to close or tax revenue that can be collected. they should go towards sustaining what we have. 

a spend of this value in a short period of time generally creates a lot of wasted tax dollars, scandals, corruption, etc. he only has 4 years to achieve this. he will be lucky if 2 of those years can be contributed to this.

pressed on his climate change policy and why we still hadn’t seen a decrease. said that it is a long process and will take time to bear fruit and the government started from essentially nothing in 2015. now have carbon tax, phasing out coal in 2020, more aggressive targets - i think he mentioned a clean fuel tax - electric cars 100% by 2035? and 50% by 2030. mentioned he liberals will be releasing a strengthened policy in the next few days.

he was pressed on the indigenous reconciliation issue, specifically about blockades - and *i believe* what he was saying was that the federal government has been working with indigenous peoples’ at their own pace to bring them out of the indian act and have them properly set up with their own governments and infrastructure and economy - but that they cannot proceed faster then indigenous peoples’ are willing to go and can’t push them. 

^someone who is a born french speaker please correct me here if i’m wrong.

pressed on why he called the election when he did, he reiterated that canada has gone through a major transformational event, and he feels it would be irresponsible to direct where he country goes from here without the express support and input of the broader electorate.

there is probably more there but that’s what i recall now.",liberals

campaign research is the first to show the liberals polling under 30% since april. that said, they also have the largest sample size, which is almost double some of the other polls.

other research firms show a much tighter race between the pcs and liberals, with the three prior polls showing a liberal lead and the fourth as a tie.  

i'm excited to see what the latest leger numbers will show.

&gt; (harper ran a tight shop)

i think that the reason that someone like harper is able to run a tight shop compared to the often messy and amateur seeming show that the trudeau government puts on from the outside looking in is that maintaining the status quo is simply easier than being progressive.

when you have a party that more or less wants the government to do less, and change less, getting people in line on that is pretty easy.

when you actually want to solve problems, people are going to disagree on what solutions are the best. there is going to be drama, infighting, mistakes, etc, because these things are necessary for progress. unfortunately, these things often manifest as \"scandals\", which end up hurting progress in democracy because people overrate how important scandals are when voting (which is mostly the fault of the media).

i've never been on a successful project with any level of complexity where mistakes didn't happen. that's how you learn. i can't imagine what that must be like on the level of directing a nation, where when you make those necessary mistakes, you risk losing control of the project to someone else who will likely just cancel it.",liberals

90% of the reason we are having to go into lockdowns and containment measures is to protect the healthcare system. more infections leads to more severe cases leads to more hospital load leads to the system overloading. if this virus came out of nowhere and spread at this rate but had close to 0% mortality, we’d still be going to concerts

i can't speak for others but my premier, françois legault, is responsible for coming up with a completely asinine vaccination schedule. 90 days between shots? wtf? why anyone in your cabinet or random doctors know more about vaccines than the manufacturer? 


but pfizer/moderna/etc are not off the hook at all. they are extremely responsible for not honouring commitments and failing to anticipate that the most hotly sought item on earth would have such a big demand. there shouldn't be cut doses to canada or any country for that matter, you should have built the infrastructure for global distribution much earlier! i know it's easy to say this as a civilian but come on, you guys promised the antidote and a tons of doses in 2021, not us! how did you not realize this?

glo1eef,2021-02-01T07:48:15.000-08:00,"sadly, you can’t entirely blame justin trudeau for canada’s vaccine delays well sir,

im an immunologist. i also completed an msc in epidemiology. what you said is totally wrong 

viruses will eventually lose fitness if they mutate too much. it happened to the h1n1 virus, in fact. it’s because you only mutate so many times without deforming other aspects of yourself. usually this means a virus will experience some kind of trade off, usually this will take on the form of reduced lethality and higher transmissibility. from an evolutionary perspective, a virus uses another living organism as a vector, it would be to its disadvantage to kill its vector.

vaccinating a population partially and having a virus spread is actually much, much better than than attempting to contain it the way we are now. in-fact, it’s analogous to what happens every year with the flu. people who have been vaccinated but still may become infected with the virus will always show much less viral load and as a result very significantly reduced inability to transmit. this is even if the person is moderately sick. this is consistent among pretty much all virus of which we have vaccines against.

the half course of antibiotics analogy is also incorrect. the result of bacterial “super bugs” is actually the result of horizontal gene transfer between bacterial strains, which i won’t go into and is a fundamentally different process than the mutation process the coronavirus is undergoing. 

by having a population that is vaccinated with a vaccine that is say, 50% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and 100% effective in preventing hospitalizations even among the elderly and continuing current preventive measures for a short time after a signifiant majority of the population has been vaccinated, you would massively curb the viruses ability to spread and as a result mutate, and the amount of community transmission associated with abandoning preventive measures afterwards would be a minor annoyance as even if the virus were to mutate to evade vaccine immunity against symptomatic infection, the mortality rate would be close to if not 0 in the already vaccinated population, and by that time there would likely be a substantial amount of updates vaccines and booster shots for existing vaccines available. this is why we didn’t need to take any drastic measures against the h1n1 virus, (cause of its comparitivley lower mortality rate), a virus which by the way, has continued to mutate and still proliferates to an extent. if that virus were to accumulate significant mutations, as i said above it’s unlikely to become more lethal, and all that would need to be done is produce an already established type of vaccine, which can be done very quickly. the situation with covid will be similar, remember that producing these first generation covid vaccines took longer because were basically starting from scratch apart from some limited data from the sars epidemic 

i was considering long term care as being part of the healthcare system 

i appreciate your concern but i’m sorry to say it appears you don’t really have an in-depth enough understanding of the subject (and that’s fine!) so your explanation was incorrect and one that i often see espoused by people with only a surface level understanding of immunology and epidemiology",liberals
