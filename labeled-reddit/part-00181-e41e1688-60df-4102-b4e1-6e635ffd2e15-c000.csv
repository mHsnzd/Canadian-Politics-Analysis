the idea that fptp suppresses extremists is just wrong. first of all, it suppresses small parties with geographically wide support, but rewards small parties with geographically concentrated support. this whole conversation completely ignores that we literally have a quebec separarist party holding the balance of power *right now*.

secondly, we've seen far-right parties emerge in many countries, yet in only one have they achieved a governing majority. that would the us, of course, where donald trump was able hijack the republican party. if you think it couldn't happen here, just consider that *maxime bernier himself* came within a whisker of leading the conservative party.

finally, giving these far-right parties parliamentary representation has had good effects, in my view. it forces them to answer hard questions and means people with these views are included in the debate. when this happens, they haven't typically done well - the afd for example, has lost vote share. refusing to give these voters representation may suppress them in parliament, but they will continue to exist in society and become more disillusioned and extreme.",conservatives

also, if you think canadas immigration system is bad, you should take a look south of the border. the usa's immigration has a family based system allows immigrants to bring over entire families regardless of their skills. they call it chain migration. canada has implemented a points based system where job skills are given the highest priority

you bring up a very important issue of skills. for years the business community keeps saying they need immigrants to fill the skills shortage. so immigrants with skills end up here driving taxis because they don't meet the requirements of the specific industry.  this is an  example of  one branch of government not talking to another. it has been the same way for years in both liberal and conservative governments.  we most definitely need reform on this front. 

at the other end of the spectrum there is a shortage of low wage menial labor. immigration really is the only way to resolve this. the other alternative would be to increase minimum wage  to a point where it these jobs  become more attractive to natural born canadians. but the business community is obviously against this, so both liberal and cpc governments keep the status quo.

keep in mind that these first generation immigrants working in menial jobs work their asses off so that their kids get a good education and generally end up in higher paying jobs and contribute more in taxes.

&gt; however, as tom flanagan, harper’s onetime strategist, pointed out a few years ago in an article in policy options on the nature of the new tory coalition, dig beneath that top-line measure of success among immigrants, and the numbers get more complicated.  for instance, flanagan noted that harper’s conservatives won just 31 per cent of visible minority voters and only 12 per cent of muslims.

this reads as if written by co-op student waking up from his or her entitlement stupor, reading for the 1st time about he world and then what most of us would only wonder while on a bathroom break, this person and the editor decided to actually print this drivel.

then i find out, it's steve paikin. i expected at least some speculation on why. nah, just a rant today.

reason is, steve, it's exactly because of the highest level of democracy in every aspect of our society that we cannot exploit people like we used to. our own history shows it and prime example would be railway to the west but there are many more, you just have to look a bit more closely. the only people we can exploit are 3rd world country super low wage tim horton servers, some in construction (our life blood) and live-in nannies from philippines. that's it.

the other countries  are in that stage of development where push and need for public good overrides any notion of decency and fairness. and we, about 50 years into the future, can only look with depressing nostalgia. few countries are also still in the grips of  real politik sphere of influence and are being held hostage without even knowing.

another reason is, our political leaders are of a \"garden variety\", people who are selected to attend to this garden we call canada that some other politicians of the years before built, those who had a vision and strength of will to see that vision  through. trudeau, ford, tory.... these are dithering types who mastered 21st century canada political game. it's not that these other countries steve mentions in his article don't have these type of politicians, it's that they are not at that level to be needing them. 

these countries are yet to build statues for people in charge today that will  be destroyed or brought down a generation or two  later.

that’s an interesting paper but it doesn’t support your characterization of it. it does not argue that canada can get by without nuclear base load generation remotely, just that the cheapest decarbonization wins are to be had by building wind generation in the prairies and power lines to move it around the country. sure, maybe that’s true but they acknowledge this caveat about wind:

&gt;the ge (2016) study finds that it is technically feasible for wind energy to make up 35% of canadian electricity generation. this is achieved by expanding wind power capacity to 65 gigawatts (gw) in canada with concentrations of 15 gw or more in ontario, quebec, and alberta. in our results, we find similar potential for wind energy, but with a different provincial distribution of installations. 

if you know how the wind thing went in ontario since this paper was written, you will understand why i view 35% as an optimistic best case.

another important caveat, which is where i think it becomes irrelevant to my point:

&gt;while it is beyond the scope of our current analysis, allowing for price-responsive demand would have two impacts on our results. first, efforts to respond to higher prices would reduce the welfare of electricity consumers. we do not conduct a welfare analysis in this paper. second, given a consistent carbon pricing signal throughout the economy, these efforts would lead to greater ghg emissions at any given carbon pricing level, increasing the effectiveness of carbon pricing.

there's also this.

*the liberals repeatedly maintain higher immigration will, as hussen says, “help us to ease the great challenges of the coming years, such as the slowing labour force growth and labour shortages linked to canada’s aging population.”*  
  
*but do the minister’s claims check out?*  
*the short answer is: not really. leading canadian economists say the liberals’ claim that higher immigration levels will offset the aging of canada’s workforce is, at the least, extremely exaggerated.*  
*as one economist half-joked, the only way immigration alone could actually make up for the country’s aging workforce would be if canada exclusively brought in only 15-year-old orphans.*

that said, quebecers have unrealistic expectations of second language speakers, to the detriment of the francisation project, in my view.  unless you speak french perfectly -- or more precisely, imperfectly in their particular way -- many quebecers do not consider you to be part of the team. it's petty. the vast majority of francophones in the world speak french as a second language and pepper it with other languages from their respective regions. those people are francophones too.

in trudeau's case, he grew up in new edinburgh, his mother and both of his step-parents are anglo, and three of his four grandparents were anglo.  yet he speaks french quite well and can probably write it better than most unilingual francophones. he also speaks french at home with his wife and kids. what more do you want?",liberals
