on another note, the \"groping\" description has always worked as a  \"make up your own adventure\" interaction. what do you think trudeau actually did? grab her ass? honk her boob like a clown horn? don't you think it would have been described directly as one of those actions if that was what happened?

personally i think he put her hand on her hip, and she took that as far as she could with \"groping\". that lines up more with the other witness who described it as \"a very brief touch\" than trudeau getting a big handful of butt.

none of that really matters now. it's just the reasoning i have that doesn't make the accusation that significant to me. like, i thought i was dancing with a girl last night cause she was grinding on me for a solid 30 seconds, put a hand on her hip and she  took a look at me then walked off (ouch, yes). i dont think that makes me a anti-famminist harasser, but the world is always changing.",liberals

like it or not, gun control is a contentious issue in urban centres, and the urban population wants something done about it. the liberal gun law isn’t really effective but definitely red meat for the base. they also said they were going to work with municipalities directly on hand gun bans, which will also go over very well with them.

what probably should happen is that private health care gets taxed, and proceeds go to our existing public health care workers, including doctors and nurses. if money = better care, that should help everyone.

the argument against is that the conservatives are evil and won’t actually do any of this. they will destroy you and your family and not try to help canadians.

this discussion is a nonstarter anyway - no political party is arguing to make medicare like any european system. the conservatives just want private businesses to profit, and the ndp just want a higher proportion of taxes to go to healthcare providers. neither of those are what you would be looking for as a marker for a party trying to approach honest-to-god duplicative care for over-demanded services in the public system.

my assumption is that he was instructed by someone to state that the bill wouldn’t regulate individuals. which it wouldn’t have in the first place. and when you’re crystal clear on what the contents of the bill are and then someone tells you to pivot your statements about it to try to run damage control, you’d become far less confident in your messaging. 


let’s be clear, i fully support the idea of including netflix, youtube, amazon prime, etc. as the broadcasters that they unequivocally are and subjecting them to the same rules that regulate cbc, ctv, global, fox, abc, etc. and i fully support considering content generators on youtube as broadcasters if they look like a broadcaster, smell like a broadcaster, and quack like a broadcaster. we need to start treating the internet like a utility and certain companies that operate using that utility as the broadcasters that they clearly are.

accordingly, i don't think there's any contradiction in criticizing trudeau for doing exactly what horgan did in bc, which is to (try to) ride the coattails of a pandemic polling bump to a majority. both are bad decisions motivated by political self-interest as well as clear indicators of what's wrong with our current electoral system. 

to answer your first question, i'll both note that minority governments are typically much better representations of where the canadian public stands considering that parties rarely if ever get above 50% in federal elections, and that there's reasonable evidence that the ndp might indeed grow and consolidate its influence on the left in the coming election, with polls putting it at around 20% now compared to its 16% finish in 2019. but the issue is, again, our current electoral system. the cpc has proved to be an ineffective opposition, meaning that it's bleeding at least a small number of centre-right voters to the lpc; that, in turn, could lead to a liberal majority with just 35% of the vote, which in my mind would be wildly unrepresentative of how canadians actually want their government to look. it's an endemic flaw of fptp, and i think it's necessary to be vocal against it while also taking pragmatic acts to strike it down wherever possible if you're opposed to it.",liberals

the real debate should be over whether or not it’s fair for the party in power to decide, based on current circumstances, to call an election whenever they want to strengthen their government and prolong their mandate.

unfortunately this is a ridiculously strong power than no government would ever want to give up when they are in power.

on the other side of the coin, i would never trade it for fixed election dates for one second. i love the no-confidence vote power in a minority (or if a majority government fractures), but it feels completely broken from a game theory standpoint to me for a government to be able to call a snap election.

i was pissed off thinking about it when harper was in power, i’m pissed off thinking about it now, and you might call me a liar, but it would piss me off even if my favorite politician of all time was in power and used that bug (not feature) of our electoral system to his advantage.

the problem is that the cat is out of the bag and to change to a different system would be perceived as elitist, undemocratic gatekeeping in an age where populist anger and dissatisfaction with technocratic institutions is at an all-time high, while civic awareness of, or even interest in, just how those institutions operate is at a seriously worrisome low. but it's inevitable now that leadership selections going forward are going to be the political equivalent of whiz-bang game show and reality-tv talent competitions responsive to \"activists\" and motivated special interests who don't care about the functions of institutions, as long as their pet cause is recognized or the candidate entices the membership with \"pretty words\" bereft of policies that they can't back up anyway.

the ccf/ndp have been contesting federal elections since 1935. so far, our best result is official opposition. we are trying to do something incredibly difficult and disrupt a two-party system that has existed since confederation.

it takes time to build a movement, and i don’t think we do ourselves any favours if we only give a leader one or two chances to grow that movement.

it took jack 4 elections to crack 100 seats and he was a special leader. give jagmeet time. he’s doing well and building his national profile.

at some point trudeau will either resign or commit a significant enough scandal that liberal support will wane. we need to position ourselves to be ready to capitalize on that when it happens by having a popular, well-known, and well-regarded leader ready to take the next step.

he hasn’t made any huge missteps, the platform is good, he’s a good communicator. this is a good combination and leaves us well-positioned to make gains next election. in the meantime, let’s focus on building the party’s finances.",liberals

honestly it feels like a lot of the ndp brass took the wrong message from jack layton's success. layton got a little bit lucky, both the bq and liberals had a downturn at the same time. he didn't turn being well liked into being the opposition. he was well liked while also being able to play on anger, that helped him take advantage of the situation.


edit: specifically on the policy point, they've shown they can be costed for smaller deficits than every other party (who knew taxing the class of people who've hoarded more wealth than at any point in history might generate revenue?), match that with stronger more straight forward policy and larger taxes. you don't need to be liberals+, might as well just vote for the liberals and accept a slightly worse outcome. too many watered down slogans too, tax the \"ultra\" rich, instead of just tax the rich. you don't need to add these frankly moronic caveats in an attempt to appease upper middle class liberals.

edited just to add: the liberal party loves cracking down on gun crime by choking out legal ownership every chance they get. look at the assault style gun ban trudeau implemented after what happened in nova scotia. three of the four firearms used in that mass shooting were obtained illegally in the united states. 

this might seem like cherry picking but statistics show time and time again that a lot of the firearms used here for violent crime are coming from the us. 

my whole takeaway on this subject is we’ll never do anything about the real problems with how guns are getting onto the streets. as well politicians will always use gun crime as the background for some feel good law that doesn’t fundamentally change anything except for legal firearm owners who aren’t breaking the law as it is.",liberals

if this law is passed, and if ontario bans the sale of all handguns this will reduce the number of handguns significantly overall in the province and just statistically will reduce the number of hand guns that are legal, then stolen and used in a crime.

i mean the fact that [you are statistically 4.6 times as likely to die by gun violence just by having a gun, legal or otherwise, regardless of the type or calibre of the gun](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2759797/) shows that simply eliminating handguns in society by any amount reduces gun violence.

furthermore, statistics canada is digging into it too as of last year, so we'll be getting national data soon. also i don't think straw purchasing of handguns can ever be the main source of crime guns(the majority of crime guns being handguns) simply for the reason that every handgun is restricted and therefore registered, and every large quantity of purchases gets audited, even as your own article says this too. with the border being closed, i can see how domestically sourced crime guns may be more significant lately, but overall i'd still point my finger at smuggling as the source of crime guns and systemic issues as the reason for their use, and not legal gun owners.

h538ygq,2021-07-13T08:34:25.000-07:00,"the problem with canada’s delusions of inclusivity and multiculturalism &gt; why would shared culture, rituals, values, etc., be different from language in that regard?

because language is a much more difficult barrier to surmount than other aspects of culture. in a workplace, for example, we can use \"reasonable accommodation\" for co-workers of different cultural backgrounds (e.g. modifying the rcmp uniform to allow observant sikhs to join), but we can't do that for language.

canada basically has two models of cultural pluralism, both reasonably successful. one is multiculturalism (called \"interculturalism\" in quebec), based on full integration and participation in institutions without requiring cultural assimilation. the other is separate institutions for the francophone minority, based on their numbers and their geographic concentration.

multiculturalism only dates back to the postwar period (particularly pierre trudeau), when large-scale non-european immigration began, but it's basically a rigorous application of the liberal principle of state neutrality, which goes back to the conclusion of the 16th-century religious wars between catholics and protestants. basically the resolution was that it wasn't possible for either side to eradicate the heretics of the other side, and so it was necessary to adopt liberal principles to allow society to exist without agreement on fundamental values like religion. see joseph heath, [the myth of shared values in canada](https://web.archive.org/web/20051031060708/http://www.myschool-monecole.gc.ca/research/publications/pdfs/manion2003_e.pdf).

despite the inflammatory headline, i would suggest that multiculturalism does indeed work pretty well.

 &gt;it's not a question of whether we should change the name of pei, but rather should we have changed it in the first place?

who do you define as ‘we’ here, the second time? because we living here and now in modernity by far and large acknowledge it as the name it has of prince edward island. *we* did not change the name — *we* have inherited it under that name from others who came before us. in fact its present name is over 220 years old, and before that it was known predominantly for a very long stretch of time by its former french name. the point here is that like land formations and who presides over them, names too change with the passage of time. and in the sense of function, the saying of “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” comes to mind. 

&gt;but you have to admit that epekwitk sounds cooler.

perhaps to some, but such preferences are subjective. and since they are, personally, no, i actually quite like how prince edward island sounds. all the same, i like how ontario, quebec, and nunavut all sound too. but of course we also like what we are used to. 

&gt;let's start with the ones that are the greatest source of pain and work from there

but this is also completely subjective. should we change the name of wolfe island because some few salty french-speakers are still mad about the events of 1759? 

&gt;no one arbitrarily picked one man. 

you’re absolutely right — no one person, but rather a group of ignorants did this, who want to lash out and feel like they’re participating in the revolution of their day with the rest of the rebellious youth in need of a cause. people want macdonald to be a villain so they can pat themselves on the back for toppling a brass effigy of him. haven’t seen anybody getting mad at laurier yet, but i’m pretty sure he made some really racist statements about black people. w l m king even wrote in his personal journal about his admiration for hitler, yet he’s still somehow on the 50$ bill. but lashing out at macdonald is fine.",liberals

https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/03/06/when-will-the-liberal-government-keep-its-promises-on-national-pharmacare.html
&gt; before the last election, the liberal government created the advisory council on the implementation of national pharmacare to look into the need for a national drug coverage program in canada. this was the fifth national commission on this topic in the past 60 years and like its predecessors, it recommended the urgent implementation of such a program.

this time it's really going to happen, i'd like to be proven wrong. 

&gt; in their 2018 federal budget, and during their 2019 election campaign, the liberals committed to providing fair and affordable drug coverage for all canadians. however, they have yet to offer details on what that program might look like, how it would be implemented, or any timeline on when they hope to establish a national pharmacare program.

weird...

https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/04/20/national-pharmacare-a-key-element-missing-from-freeland-budget.html

2021 budget

&gt; unfortunately, this budget leaves millions of canadians behind. specifically, the 1 in 10 canadians who cannot afford to take their medications as prescribed. the bright future promised in this budget casts a large shadow over a key missing element: national pharmacare.

is this a gimmick...the answer is yes but it is also about the only way i could (and probably he could as well) come up with to make sure canadians know that he still doesn't want an election.  (his internal polling might indicate most canadians agree).  he struggles to get the media to report what he says at the best of times, this is more a letter to canadians but addressed to the gg over anything else.

as to why he doesn't want one there are plenty of good reasons.  the liberals are being very progressive with him as the kingmaker as well as the party is still closer to broke then not.  there might also be polling that says the liberals gain seats and even if the ndp gains seats as well their influence in policy gets diminished if the liberals get a majority.  there is no guarantee that the liberals stay as progressive with a majority.",liberals

do you have a source on that, or know of an article that mentions it? i tried doing a search, but couldn't find details.

i did find this article, but it's from sept 2019:

https://globalnews.ca/news/5935635/bill-21-quebec-federal-government-options/

the article does say near the end that
&gt; \"the [federal overriding] power was once used fairly freely but the last time was in 1943, on an alberta law that forbade land sales to hutterites and “enemy aliens” in the second world war.\"

the professor quoted after that isn't keen to use it. but as this article https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/notwithstanding-clause-secularism-law-religious-symbols-ban-1.5995738  also points out,

&gt;  at one point in the 1990s, the [notwithstanding] clause was so little used [by provinces] that some jurists wondered if it was, effectively, dead. since then, however, it has been invoked occasionally.

so likewise, just because something hasn't been used in a while, if it's an available tool and the situation calls for it, then i say make use of it if needed.  but yes, the political pragmatics of it would be complicated.",liberals

and i'll be frank : if you can't remove religious clothing for work, then you have no business working in an environment where you can affect others since it means you can't sidestep your beliefs at all (and while there is some that don't wear religious clothing that won't either, just because some are harder to find don't mean we can't put rules for the rest).

concerning singh, it's not only his religion, but also what many found about : the fact that in ontario he actively lobbied for having the right for sikhs of not wearing helmets on motorcycles and trying to make ontario to redo the whole sex-ed courses with \"input\" from religious community (i.e. censorship). and to make it worse, each time the question about his religion was being asked, he kept trying to sidestep it with a \"we are all progressive\", which do not fly here, no matter the religion.

and you can add him being patronizing when coming in quebec, with his first tour being \"you are wrong about bill 21!\", which is seen as a big no-no since it will means \"another fucking bloke from the roc trying to patronize us and try make us feel like assholes\". and the second trying to propose stuff that we already have (even if imperfect) and putting them under ottawa control, which is also another big no-no.

for the record, a few humorous but done seriously polls were done about party leaders during the last election, and singh actually landed the \"most likely to take a beer with\" spot here, but someone who is sympathetic and nice don't mean shit if he have ideas that people still don't like. he did nothing to help his cause by being patronizing to us, and worse, he don't understand at all the mentality here, unlike layton who understood how quebec work on many issues and fully understood the need of political autonomy that we have here.

i don't consider myself a \"centrist\" because i think that the idea we've adopted the left/right divide is a really crappy way to politick and if anything we should start with a baseline of the political compass. when you break it down to that left/right divide you have to start taking on positions not normally associated with those economic ideologies. like to be \"left-wing\" you inherently have to kinda be for expanding the role of government seeing as if you believe in a planned economy (which is basically what the \"left wing\" is originally supposed to be). i'll take someone like me, i consider myself more on he libertarian side of things, but understand that there are some industries or products (water, air, electricity, internet, armed forces, justice systems, police services, all that wonderful stuff) that should just not be left to a free market. luxury or non-essential services though absolutely should. but with all of that, economic management is divorced from social management. the state has no place to tell you who you are and can only set the baseline for a decent society (so like, not killing people is good, stealing is probably not awesome, and burning a cross on someone's lawn cause they're black also isn't great).

all that to say is that our individual moral compass does guide our political beliefs but this is a crazy long winded way of saying that it doesn't do much good to engage on wide ideologies and should instead use those ideologies to inform how we view an issue and compare options and make a decision that then best fits our moral code while adhering to a few razors and checks that keep for a decent society.",conservatives

your consistent insistence on ignoring convention doesn't do wonders for your legitimacy in this conversation.  trudeau would be compelled to resign, and if he did there would no way to force the lpc to elect a new pm (not least because he would remain their leader).  that's a recipe for a new election.

&gt;when a motion or law is made regarding a specific subject, it takes priority over more general rules

a non-binding motion doesn't take priority over anything, least of all long-standing convention. that's why they call it non-binding.

&gt;why throw all of that away just for one convention not listed in the law when we have a perfectly good house of commons that can rule on a matter the governor general asks it to?

because that convention is extremely important, and because the precedent of the unelected gg playing politics with when to hold elections and ignoring the advice of the elected leader of this country is horrifying.  the gg is not \"unsure\" of what do do, because there are clear rules for situations like this, established over centuries of parliamentary democracy, and so there is no need to throw this back to the house.

you're, what, 17? i have to assume given the intersection of wild conviction and complete disconnection from reality.  conventions matter, and while our system is flawed it is far from illegitimate.  that means we operate under the established and mutually recognized rulebook, and we don't turn hand over power to unelected autocrats because we dislike what the elected leaders are doing.

you've got strong - if half-formed - beliefs on how things should operate, which is fine.  but that is not how things currently operate, and it is ridiculous to suggest that we should abandon our system of government in favour of dangerous precedent because you dislike the idea of an election that hasn't been called yet.",liberals

we also know this because we have a similar officer, the speaker. everyone would be pissed off if the speaker acted autocratically or advised the governor general to dissolve parliament or do anything else. but they are just as much so elected by the commons, and if anything the commons elects them with an even stronger position where the governor general doesn´t even have the option to decline them. the rulings of the speaker are constrained by motion of passing a rule or precedent the commons adopts, amends, and repeals, and their rulings can be appealed to all of the members without dismissing the speaker whose judgment may be considered useful in general but on some points the commons wishes to reserve their right to decide to themselves. 

the governor general doesn´t turn into a strongman by refusing a dissolution. all they do is listen to a body that was much more democratically elected than any individual prime minister is instead of the prime minister. a governor general should instead be bound to receive the assent of the commons for a snap election, and i would suggest passing that as a formal statute which we know unequivocally that westminster parliaments can do.

i understand that.  i'm saying they can't, and it's not really their decision. if they disagree with a decision that the pm is making within the pm's power, then they have one option: remove the pm.

much of our government is run on convention, they are not any less useful or powerful than the rules we've written down.  if you can't understand that you've got no business commenting on canadian politics.

it's largely irrelevant that you would *like* our government to work differently, because what we're talking about here is how it *does* work.  you cannot simply pretend our government works differently than it does - and that's precisely what you're doing here.

the speaker is not the pm, not even close.  the gg has no democratic mandate to act outside of their expected role - which is to accept the advice of the pm as long as they retain the confidence of the house.  the pm is functionally the executive, and most canadians vote with the expectation that the leader of the party with the most seats will operate in that capacity. if you'd like that to change, we have a system in place to modify the constitution and codify whatever you'd like - you're welcome to run for office on that platform.

the motion in question is just as non binding as any convention is. it is also a convention to implement things that were implemented by majority vote of the commons, let alone nearly every single one of the members of the commons. 

as for if trudeau resigns, then the governor general nominates more candidates to be prime minister, and if the liberals refuse to vote for this person, then the commons can approve of someone else, repeat ad nauseum until a new prime minister is found and will show that people should not benefit from selfish behaviour using things gained by the trust of the people to achieve a set of policy goals. 

i am 21 jackass. i´ve voted in a federal election before. 

it is also illegitimate to abide by conventions when the will of actually democratically elected people, not the prime minister who gets a couple hundred votes but i mean the commons where 18.35 million people voted for it in 2019, voting on a specific topic, is made less worthy of effect than the advice of one man given just a generalized department to run as an executive leader not the unifier of the whole country. we change conventions all the time, like how it used to be that the prime minister at the end of even a majority government ordinarily manipulated the date of the election in the last few months to benefit themselves, or how the speaker used to be virtually appointed by the prime minister but now is elected by secret ballot vote by majority vote of the mps. they are supposed to be useful for us and when they can´t provide more benefit than alternatives could reasonably provide, they should be ditched. 

all the governor general would be doing here is to make the dissolution contingent on the actual advice of the commons to do so, being more likely to express the will of what most people want given that it is more representative of people, including people from just above the voting age to the last years of their lives, including people from all provinces and territories, of all colours, faiths and the lack of faith, men and women, languages, many different professions and wealth levels aside from trudeau who is worth about ten million dollars, far more than the typical voter and even the typical mp, and of the different political opinions people have. trudeau is incapable of being as representative as the house of commons because nobody ever could be. that is the exact opposite of an authoritarian move by a governor general and is a pro-democracy move by them, not acting in an unelected manner but being conscious of their lack of elective mandate by putting the trust in when to hold a new election before it is required to be held by law in the hands of people who are the best examples of democracy that canada as a confederation has at the moment.",liberals
