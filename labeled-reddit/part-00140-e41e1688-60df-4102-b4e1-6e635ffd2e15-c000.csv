fyi, i am vaccinated and i believe in the vaccines.  but the percentage where herd immunity kicks in depends on the variant of covid at that particular time.

if my memory is correct, the estimated percentage of herd immunity for the original strain of covid was something like 70%.  but then the delta variant came and the percentage for herd immunity changed again.

we can’t predict for sure what variants will come in the future, especially a variant that may seriously reduce the effectiveness of the currently available vaccines (in which case, new booster shots that target such a new variant would be needed).

so the herd immunity percentage may change in the future, and worse, it may become higher, if other variants become dominant and those variants are more effective against the vaccines available at that time.",liberals

not all terminations are for cause.  absent explicit agreements otherwise (e.g. a collective agreement), employers can also terminate employees without cause provided they give statutory notice (or payment in lieu).  common-law severance may also be owed, but since severance is usually related to tenure it could easily be minimal for an employee terminated just after being 'hired'.",liberals

that's my problem when conservatives focus on \"balancing the budget\" more often than not it's at the expense of future revenues.

-gm shares sold early

-500+ million in cuts at the cra folding teams that had a proven record of bringing in more than they cost (but hey he balanced the budget) only at the expense of future revenue.

-phx payroll system cut training and key elements from program required to complete basic payroll.

i could go on but when the balanced budget comes at the expense of lost revenue (cra cuts), gm shares sold early only to claim a balanced budget, and cuts to new programs that they don't even work when rolled out isn't competence.

look deeper than just \"balanced budget\".

hjw0yv9,2021-11-08T10:59:47.000-08:00,"ndp and liberals in talks to keep minority government in power i disagree on quite a few of your bullet points. 
i agree that pharma and dental should be covered by health care but not federally.
as far as child care i would like for things to change so that a single wage earner should be able to support a family. of course now you’re talking changes to the entire way corporations have run things the last 50 years.
infrastructure and mass transit is pretty bad here. definitely a federal issue and if the government is going to throw money around, that should be a priority. same for the caf.
police, etc should be a provincial issue.
and what do you mean “less generous cash transfers to seniors?” are you referring to oas and cpp? as it is they really don’t get a lot. if you’re referring to seniors receiving covid benefits and then being bumped up to another tax bracket and all that entails well i don’t feel bad for them. they took the money.
don’t think the feds should necessarily get involved with provincial/municipal issues.
taxes. i pay an awful lot each year and, yeah, it sucks. but i do realize that they’re necessary. also why some of us get a little pissed when the government seems to be just handing it out without giving any thought as to how it’s going to be repaid. tricky issue. tax the ultra rich people and corporations too much and they’ll walk.

&gt;[t]he various supply management schemes in dairy, poultry and eggs, present advantages both for food producers and taxpayers. these legislated marketing tools have been designed to impose disciplines on sellers at a commodity-specific level and to replace a farmer-against-farmer competitiveness with a united and concerted effort by farmers to sell collectively for mutual advantage. orderly marketing has helped ensure that a fair amount of market power remains in the hands of farmers, ensuring the viability of a number of food sectors. it has also enabled remote areas to keep farm production and processing facilities, mitigating the distribution costs to consumers living in those areas. at the same time, supply management schemes allow quotas to be traded without controls along the lines of highest bidders among licensed producers. values may therefore go up dramatically and capitalization costs for farmers rise accordingly, limiting new entry in the sector. the system should be strengthened for its advantages, but reformed with a view to a greater equity and to facilitate entry of new farmers.

hlcywo5,2021-11-19T14:52:53.000-08:00,"opinion: canada’s conservatives self-destruct, again – and maybe that’s for the best &gt; while i agree that the public have certainly shifted away from conservative economic policy broadly, i disagree that experts have. certainly this once fairly orthodox package of ideas is coming under more consistent and effective attack but i'd say there still exists a majority of experts who believe that right of centre economic policy is still broadly better than left of centre economic policy.

i rely on the economist to cover expert thinking on economics, and i would disagree with your assessment. for example, [in may 2019](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/05/16/economists-are-rethinking-fiscal-policy), pre-covid:

&gt; such warnings [about the us debt-to-gdp ratio, boosted by trump's tax cuts] have fallen on deaf ears not just in washington, but on wall street too. financial markets, hungry for dollar-denominated safe assets, betray no concern about america’s debts. the risk of a crisis is not the only theoretical downside to public borrowing, but the others are looking unconvincing. for example, the argument that debt is crowding out private investment is hard to sustain when firms are awash with cash and can borrow at extremely low rates.
&gt;
&gt; in january olivier blanchard, a former chief economist of the imf, told the annual meeting of the american economic association that there were many reasons to doubt the supposed costs of public debt. since then jason furman and larry summers of harvard university, both of whom advised barack obama on economics, have written in foreign affairs, a journal, that it is time to kill off the “debt obsession”.

furman and summers have a later paper, published in november 2020, which suggests replacing the debt-to-gdp ratio (which compares stocks and flows) with a new guidepost: keeping real interest payments on the debt at less than 2% of gdp. [a reconsideration of fiscal policy in the era of low interest rates](https://www.piie.com/system/files/documents/furman-summers2020-12-01paper.pdf).

this isn't mmt. furman and summers aren't saying that debt doesn't matter (as the unorthodox advocates of mmt argue), only that the cost of public debt doesn't justify tackling it aggressively.

the other question is whether we want less public services (smaller government) and lower taxes, or more public services and higher taxes. there isn't a tradeoff between more public services and economic growth. [stephen gordon](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2007/06/doing-it-by-the.html). public services paid for through taxation are a form of collective shopping. as joseph heath explains:

&gt; if canadians want to consume more health care or a new subway or better roads, what are their options? the situation is the same as with the condo residents who want a new sauna: if people want to buy more of this stuff (and are willing to buy less of something else), then they should vote to raise taxes and buy more of it. it doesn't necessarily impose a drag on the economy to raise taxes in this way, any more than it imposes a drag on the economy when the residents of a condo association vote to increase their condo fees.
&gt;
&gt; one can see, then, the absurdity of the view that taxes are intrinsically bad, or that lower taxes are necessarily preferable to higher taxes. the absolute level of taxation is unimportant; what matters is how much individuals want to purchase through the public sector (the \"club of everyone\"), and how much value the government is able to deliver. this is why low-tax jurisdictions are not necessarily more \"competitive\" than high-tax jurisdictions (any more than low-fee condominiums are necessarily more attractive places to live than high-fee condominiums). furthermore, **the government does not \"consume\" the money collected in taxes** - this is a fundamental fallacy; it is merely the vehicle through which we organize our spending. in this respect, taxation is basically a form of collective shopping. needless to say, how much shopping we do collectively, and in what size of groups, is a matter of fundamental indifference from the standpoint of economic prosperity.

as far as i know, this is completely uncontroversial among economists.",conservatives

his recharging method of 2 hours of driving followed by 20 minutes of charging would get you to burns lake from prince george, but that's the only supercharger you'll get on that entire trip. according to the first link, a supercharger will give you up to 130 kilometres for 20 minutes of charging time. that won't get you to prince rupert, and that won't even get you to terrace, about 144 kilometres away from rupert and the last place with any kind of charging station (and indeed the last major town) before rupert. you'd be able to get to a charging station near kitwanga, roughly halfway between terrace and smithers, which is itself roughly halfway between prince george and prince rupert. to get enough charge to drive the 108 kilometres to terrace from there, you'd need to charge the car for **3 hours and 22 minutes,** since a level 2 charging station gives at most 32 kilometres of range **every hour** instead of every 10 minutes. the kitwanga charging station has exactly one plug, so if there's already someone there you'll probably be there a while. finally, to give your car enough juice to drive the 144 kilometres to prince rupert, you'll need to charge your car at the level 2 station in terrace for **4 hours and 30 minutes.** you're now spending the equivalent time of driving to prince rupert in a conventional car *just charging your car.* it literally doubles your driving time.

oh yeah, i forgot to mention that you can completely forget about doing this in a tesla virtually anywhere in bc north of kamloops, and most places in canada not on the trans-canada highway or major centres. there are very few tesla chargers in northern bc, meaning that they must charge at home and never do roadtrips. also, forget about driving up to the territories or any communities that require using highway 37 or the alaska highway, period. the closest charging station to the supercharger in carcross, yukon is in hazelton, bc, a little before that charger near kitwanga. hazelton to carcross is an 1160 kilometre drive, a big undertaking for even a gas vehicle since there are very few gas stations along highway 37 - there are a grand total of 3 along the nearly 900 kilometres it runs through bc. there are exactly zero charging stations. as for the northwest territories, the shortest distance between two matching adapters that i could find is between peace river, alberta, and yellowknife. that's almost exactly 1000 kilometres of driving, with the only charging station in that distance being an incompatible tesla adapter in high level. if you want to see the yukon in an ev you'll need to take the ferry from bellingham to skagway and cross back into canada from there. if you want to see the nwt in an ev, you're completely out of luck.

this is also disregarding conditions. roadtrips aren't exclusively done in the summer - it can get pretty cold up here, which would drain the batteries faster and cause them to charge slower, eating up more time. there's not really a way to prevent this in a way that doesn't use more power.

tl;dr: the us and particularly california, where the 1000 miles were driven, has the infrastructure. we don't, unless you're in one of the more populated areas or you live near the trans-canada highway. it's worth noting that i'm very much *not* in that group. you're also out of luck for roadtrips up here entirely if you drive a tesla.

for the former, it depends on what you believe \"conservative\" means. in my view, and at the best of times, conservatism is a balance of traditionalism and fiscal austerity. i don't think that conservatism at its best is the lame combination of lower taxes and being pro-israel. nor is it the american-import of libertarianism where minimal government is the be-all, end-all.   


conservatism is about conserving what is beautiful and good about your nation. it is athwart the idea that we need to \"progress\" from here to there in a never-ending upwards trajectory of aggressive, rapid change. true conservatism includes promoting family values (whether or not you like it, families truly are the backbone of any nation), displaying a culture of strong morals, retaining cultural homogeneity, professionalism, and yes, even conserving ecosystems despite what developers want. theodore roosevelt was a great example of this, even taking on massive monopolizing multi-national corporations, and a keen appreciation for preserving nature through his relationship with john muir.

that's absolutely false. the less you spend on carbon the more you will get back because the rebate is fixed and not dependent on income. the incentive to that is obvious and has been explained clearly many times.

example: you spend $200 on carbon and your rebate is $500 so you get $300 dollars. however if you spent $100 on carbon, your rebate is still $500 dollars so you now get $400 dollars back. these are just example numbers obviously but do you understand now?

on the other hand with the tory plan you get more points if you spend more on carbon. that doesn't exactly give people incentive to use less does it?

&gt;at least with the current cpc plan that money can only be spent on green items that you need. and if it is true that green items like transit passes or even to help pay for a new efficient fridge when an old one dies isn't really a bad thing.

it does not make them more attainable at all. you can still do this with the liberal plan but you can also use it for groceries or rent if you need. i imagine that's a lot more helpful for some low income families than saving their petro points for government designated purchases. 

the tory plan, which is ineffective for climate change when capped at only $50/tonne, is also far more punishing for low income families. it also has increased bureaucracy and government overreach wherein o'toole will be mandating what canadians can use the money for rather than giving them a rebate and letting them decide for themselves. it's the opposite of small government and i am 100% certain that every conservative supporter claiming it's good now would be panning it and screaming about government meddling if it had been suggested by another party.",conservatives

in toronto most downtown elites — the people who make money and own property and control our city — seem to support the liberals.

the ndp can barely win ridings here and our city politics is extremely conservative. ndp supporters seem to be to me mostly young progressive people, often renters who have often unstable inadequately-paying precarious contract or service employment and are living close to paycheque to paycheque unable to keep up with the cost of living and will never be able to afford a condo or house. or [as another poster said](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/o8y1iu/the_ndp_turns_60_its_never_truly_been_the_party/h37wr9q/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), people with office jobs who live in a tiny apartment. super elite!

you may find this group annoying, or loud on twitter or in the cultural conversation in general, but they are not really elites in any real way — they neither have meaningful political power nor wealth.

of course there are some ndp supporters who have wealth and are comfortable and secure (and often the ndp's elected representatives fall into the property-owning class, which is bad and telling about our society and politics and who can successfully run for office, but is something common across all parties — homeowners run this country), but the party and its supporters still don't really have any meaningful political power or control over our society. the downtown elites here who own all the property and make all the money and decide everything about how this city is run and its political representation send the liberals into government consistently even in the most downtown of downtown ridings.",liberals

ireland and norway endorsed the basel ban amendment on eliminating the export of waste from rich to poor countries. canada refused to support the initiative, which became binding last year after 97 countries ratified it.

canada’s security council competitors also signed the un optional protocol to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. ottawa has not.

norway and ireland have ratified a greater number of international labour organization conventions than canada.

ireland joined most of the world’s countries at the 2017 un conference to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination. it also signed onto the resulting treaty and is not part of the nuclear-armed nato alliance.

neither norway nor ireland are part of the g7, a u.s.-led alliance of seven wealthy countries. nor are they members of the lima group of countries seeking to overthrow venezuela’s un-recognized government. canada launched the lima group with peru in mid-2017 after the organization of american states, driven primarily by caribbean member states, refused to criticize venezuela. norway has sought to mediate the venezuelan crisis.

unlike canada, norway and ireland are not members of the “core group” of foreign ambassadors that have largely determined haitian affairs since jean-bertrand aristide’s government was overthrown in 2004. some haitians have dubbed the group, led by the u.s., france and canada, as the “core gang.”

in contrast to canada, neither norway nor ireland have been singled out for criticism by at least four un bodies for failing to hold their mining companies accountable for their international operations. despite a litany of environmental and human rights abuses by canadian extractive firms, ottawa continues to offer some of the most controversial companies diplomatic and financial backing.

compared to canada, both ireland and norway have far better records on upholding palestinian rights at the un. since 2000 canada has voted against 166 general assembly resolutions critical of israel’s treatment of palestinians. ireland and norway haven’t voted against any of these resolutions.

ireland and norway have contributed far less to climate disturbances, which are ravaging parts of africa and asia that bear little responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. both norway and ireland’s per capita emissions are a little more than half of canada’s.

even under the terms ottawa itself has laid down for its security council bid, norway and ireland are more deserving of the seats. justin trudeau claims countries should support canada for a two-year position on the un’s most powerful decision-making body because “canada is committed to working with partners around the world to build a better future for all of us — from growing economies that benefit everyone, to fighting climate change, to creating a safer, more peaceful world.” the website promoting canada’s candidacy for the security council says that “climate change represents an existential threat to vulnerable countries” and “canada understands the importance of rules-based international order.” based on these points, ireland and norway are better candidates.",liberals

hart26r,2021-08-28T15:37:17.000-07:00,"the poll thread - sunday, august 29, 2021 &gt;leantossup for this week. cbc is similar, with the liberals at 145 and the cpc at 126

both leantossup and cbc have the cpc at a 1/3 shot of winning the most seats. you're looking at the mean number and not talking about probabilities. 

&gt;for most of the month, the liberals have maintained a their lead and had maintained it fairly consistently before that point as well.

we've seen potentially dramatic change in opinion in just the last week. why would the numbers before that be relevant now? 

&gt;we still have no idea whether this weeks polls are an outlier or not 

3 daily trackers and ostensibly at least ipsos have all shown the same trend, it's not an outlier. for what it's worth, it looks like trudeau is bleeding support as opposed to his opposition gaining it.

&gt;there just doesn't seem like there's enough evidence available to argue that the cpc are likely to have a prolonged lead in seat projections going forward.

bricker also talked about this. once a constituent decides they want a change in government, it's very difficult to win them back. some of the major pollsters have even gone out of their way to say they're noticing people want change.  

&gt;. even if i'm wrong about the liberals maintaining the most seats and the cpc tie or exceed the liberals seat count, then as stated before, the most likely outcome would be the bloc or ndp holding up the liberals in return for concessions

why do you think that an lpc who doesn't win the most seats will get supported? i seriously don't understand this at all. almost within the decade we saw a cpc minority with an ndp opposition. why is there an assumption it will just be the lpc. i just don't agree with the claim here, especially without evidence. both the bq and ndp can get concessions from the cpc as well.

sad thing for the idiots at post media is trudeau is going nowhere, carney is going nowhere too, and freeland is probably canada’s most anti oligarchy finance minister in decades (she’s not that anti oligarchy but the point stands) and she’s almost certainly next liberal leader. she is the brains behind this governments economic policy and she is exceptionally talented as a cabinet minister. for the record i’m not a liberal but i believe freeland is a shoe in for next liberal leader, if not next prime minister, and it hurts the national post because it means the liberals are staying as centre left as they are.",liberals

those stickers are usually seen as an accessory on oversized gas-guzzler pickup trucks that have chrome-plated testicles hanging from the trailer hitch, and other bumper stickers that show greta thunberg being anally raped. most often, the people displaying those decals have a track record of spelling the prime minister's name \"turdeau\" and/or calling him any number of homophobic slurs. or from the other end of the political spectrum, describing him in no uncertain terms as a racist, a nazi, a crook and a sociopath who cares not one whit for ordinary people, and has done absolutely nothing while in office but line his own pockets and that of his \"rich friends\". that he is just harper with nice hair and that his deputy is a nazi herself. but sure, that's a problem of liberals not having a track record of organized and serious behaviour.

&gt; we could have had investigation after investigation, and this government could have been dropped before the pandemic. but no, someone had to act as the grown up in parliament.

there were multiple investigations that the ndp took part in. quite gleefully i should add. farcical inquisitions into margaret trudeau's finances, and conspiracy theories about covid being unleashed out of winnipeg by \"chinese spies\" with ties to the liberal party, that didn't get canadians one iota any closer to the ndp's stated goals of expanded social services. that's serious behaviour?

i really don't follow your line of questioning here. i'm sure the liberals would have been fine with the government dropping last october, as the tag-team twins of the opposition would likely have been cast into the wilderness where they belong, until they learned to grow up and present credible policy.",liberals

h715hkq,2021-07-29T11:42:22.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access i'll put this up front - it's been a good discussion so far - we can always argue about the finer details - i'll leave this as my last response since i don't want to take up more of your time.

&gt; there are many cases where the prosecutor believes it wasn't a natural miscarriage, and, therefore, prosecutes. i could ask you to google, but i did it for you:

has the mother of a terminated pregnancy ever been charged in canada for this when abortion was illegal?  i'm only aware of doctors that have been charged - primarily in the us but i wouldn't be surprised if doctors had been charged in canada decades ago.  i think my original point about fear mongering is that canada is so far away from prosecuting mothers for miscarriages with literally no law on the books regarding abortion that it is fear mongering stating advocating for any restrictions will lead to mothers being charged for miscarriages. canada is one of the few countries that literally has no law on abortion since the last law was struck down in 1988.

when a dysfunctional country like el salvador is the example i don't think that's a genuine example. european countries actually have stricter laws on abortion than canada and i'm pretty sure mothers in most of western europe where those restrictions are in place aren't charged when they have miscarriages. for the other examples you gave in the us that could enable prosecution - have those fears been realized? some states have had laws on the books that allow a newly born to be murdered as long as the umbilical cord is still attached like virginia [here](https://www.nbc12.com/story/11690000/campbell-county-mother-cant-be-charged-in-babys-death/). that clearly wasn't the intent of the laws - but i'm almost certain there would be a good number of people who feel they need to be pro-choice to the point where they are  unwilling to reform a law that would allow that sort of a murder to happen, as to not give an inch to the other side due to fear monger with examples like what you brought up with el salvador - the thought is well maybe some people will literally murder babies outside the womb but if we try to restrict that at all its just too dangerous and will end with the hand maids tale becoming reality.

&gt; i disagree; we operate from the premise that taking a life is never 'okay', but there are extenuating circumstances that will allow for a person to avoid prosecution, or allow for prosecution of a lesser crime.

if it's legal to do - then it's effectively okay. proportional self defense that results in the death of an assailant is okay as long as it is proportional. both morally and legally.

&gt; ok, so we're coming to semantics here. what we have is an issue of what is acceptable for some and not for others; the law doesn't prosecute adultery as a criminal act, however, it is legal grounds for a divorce in canada.

that kind of goes without saying - we have no fault divorce so any reason is acceptable for a divorce.",liberals
