2. a subset - maybe a fairly large one - of gay guys have a *lot* more sexual partners than any comparable subset of straight people. i've had sex with close to 100 guys in the last ~10 years, and a lot of my gay friends have similar partner counts or higher. i am on the low end of partner counts in some of my groups of friends. i know very few - maybe no - straight people with similar magnitude of partner counts.

3. once hiv became disproportionately prevalent among gay men, this supercharged the impact of the above two factors.

there is an anecdote from the book \"and the band played on\" (a history of the hiv/aids pandemic in the us) that is rather chilling in retrospect, describing how gay men used to meet pretty frequently at sti clinics. they'd just been treated - this was before hiv/aids, when everything could be treated with some antibiotics - and you know they're probably decent in bed. why not go home and bump your newly-treated uglies together?

gay guys have a lot of hiv because a lot of gay guys have high sexual partner counts, the activities gay guys practice with their sexual partners are much riskier on average than the activities practiced by comparable straight couples, and the prevalence of hiv in the population continuously supercharged those two factors.",liberals

i would say that it isn't legit to expect someone to read a 200 page book

but that's not what you gave me

you gave me two pretty short readable sources

for me i think everyone on this territory of canada should be treated equally under the law.  ie. i don't think that people from fn stock should have different rights or obligations under the law compared to people of nigerian stock

your sources make the pretty obviously correct point that there were people living here before the europeans first came and that they had societies.  that i think is pretty obviously inarguable and i am not looking to disagree with that.

your sources also go into some details on the political conflicts between the european nation states and the indigenous nation states.  and more recently into the decisions of a couple of dudes and dudettes on the candian supreme court

obv what once were the indigenous nation states kind of got fucked over to put it mildly.  and the indigenous people also got kind of fucked over.  i don't think anyone is looking to say otherwise

for me though, what it boils down to, is i don't really care about either the history or about the law.  if the history is that some bunch of people got fucked over that sucks, but that's basically all of history. 
 if the law says that something has to be done then if i think it's a law that makes sense i would agree with it, and if i think it's a law that doesn't make sense then i would think we should get rid of that law.  to be clear i think that if a law in any way treats people differently based on their ethnicity it is an evil law.  i think that all people living here have a moral intrinsic right to be treated equally and that this supersedes anything else.  i think that anything that runs counter to equal treatment irrespective of a person's ethnic background is an abomination.  

and basically the asks of fn groups are that people who are ethnically fn should have different and superior rights

so i don't see why i would be on board with their asks considering i am vehemently against the principles that underly what they are asking for",liberals

however, the carbonmiles program serves as the candy coating for this set of changes, and that's where my mind boggles.  it's less stringent (and therefore on a superficial level less credible) than existing lpc policy, but it's also a consumer visible carbon price in a way that directly contradicts the plain meaning of o'toole's earlier promises.  where's the natural constituency?",conservatives

the lpc reaction (2015-era) was to use debt-to-gdp as the focal point instead, depriving opposition parties of free fiscal room to promise goodies without compensating cuts or tax increases.  that approach seems to have been a broad success, but of course reasonable people can disagree about whether it's strict enough to motivate a return to normalcy after covid-related spending.",liberals

hdezjcs,2021-09-18T12:53:27.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected its actually pretty simple, but probably not an opinion you'll agree with.

the liberal party is actually the one that probably aligns with my political views the most. it also has andrew weaver's endorsement, whose opinion i value highly (a reason why i voted ndp in bc's 2020 provincial election). trudeau doesn't actively piss me off aside from their electoral promises and like you said, there's been some things that have been accomplished under their tenure.

why is it then that i decided to vote for a conservative candidate instead of the liberals like i did in 2015? because the liberal candidate in my riding is none other than [taleeb noormohamed, a candidate who has flipped at least a dozen homes from 2005 and has earned $4 million from house flipping activity](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vancouver-liberal-homes-flipped-1.6158955). 

he hasn't engaged in anything illegal and you may have a personal opinion about there's nothing immoral about house flipping. and i can get and understand that point of view. however, the moment you talk about resolving a housing crisis but engage in house flipping was a bit too much irony for me personally.

house flipping is not really an activity that any of my colleagues particularly endorse or actively engage in when i was in property management, but that may be because i don't hang around the 'right' kind of people. 

i've heard some shit involving real estate that would probably infuriate canadians who are looking to buy homes, so taleeb's housing activity isn't particularly pleasant in my eyes. i had some issues with jwr's conduct but she hasn't pissed me off in a way that taleeb has and that man hasn't even stepped into office yet.

you could argue that i could vote ndp and i certainly could but they're not close to winning the riding as the conservative candidate is. also i have prejudice against activist background so it doesn't particularly win over me.

so this is where we are now. i vote for the party i don't like because i don't like my favoured party's candidate by a massive mile. same shit as when i vote abc, usually isn't the vote i wanted to make. 

that's part of first past the post baby. if it was mmr or something i would pretty much solely only vote for the party and not care about who is actually representing me as much.",liberals

power goes to the side with the *most* votes.  you cannot group together a larger group of people who very likely don't agree on much and say that they deserve to have power instead.

&gt;gerrymandering isnt cheating. they just set up the ridings. your candidate just happens to lose.  
&gt;  
&gt;and we set up geographic ridings the same. the supporters of some candidates are split up because they dont live in the same area. it is cheating them out of representatives.

gerrymandering *is* cheating, because it's designing the ridings with the explicit goal of making your opponent's support as inefficient as possible. the resulting ridings rarely correspond to any sensible geographic or demographic lines, and can not only make the election less fair, but the resulting representative less effective. if the ridings are designed fairly (and ours are), it's hardly cheating for people to lose because more of their neighbours disagree with them than agree.

fiscal deficit need debt to be repaid. that debt is repaid through inflation.

but you'll say : look at the cpi, it's just 0.8% in 2021. but that's because t-shirt and furniture are at -10%, but process meat and cheese are at +8% inflation. meanwhile, housing and renting is at +7% inflation.

so if you don't spend that much on none essensial product, the inflation is much higher than 0.8% because inflation is product specific. wood, during the pandemic had inflation over 200%.

fiscal deficit to restart the economy during a pandemic make sense. fiscal deficit every single years doesn't.

giek7qa,2021-01-06T15:36:46.000-08:00,"canada pm trudeau expresses concern about violence in washington &gt; who supports wealth redistribution via taxes?

not really a neoliberal thing, at best they hold up a tepid defense of such transfers at worst they gut the welfare state as seen under clinton/blair.

also trudeau ( and more broadly the federal liberals ) take keynes seriously long after most neoliberals rejected him and didn't get quite so caught up in the deregulation fad that ran through the '90s and 00s.

to my eye at least the federal liberals may largely inhabit a very centrist position on the left-right spectrum but don't cling to the particular trend with neoliberals of being very left wing on social policy and fairly right wing on economic policy. they pick and choose a bit more, particularly on the economic front where you can find paul martin as the author of our 90s austerity as well as the proponent of deficit spending in 2015. while the average may not seem much better then obama/blair/clinton i think the modicum of consideration they give policy before they implement it takes a lot of hard edges off the usually right-leaning economic policy of neoliberals.

more and more it seems that conservates have no real long term plans other than trying to entice foreign investment by joining the race to the bottom, or selling off or cutting down public infrastructure and services to say they're balanced the budget, so all that is left is to attack anything progressive and appeal to the social conservatives who are either well intentioned and completely blind to socioeconomic privelledge and the increasingly well understood limiting factors to upwards social mobility; or have become disillusioned with politics and take a throw the baby out with the bath water approach to government spending (which in fair in some respects, though really it should point out the need for electoral reform) and choose to trust the business community more to look after their interests (don't like how your employer is treating you than find another job hur dur); are in the anti-science and climate denying crowd; or, are well, worse... aka the social conservatives who want north america to go back to being white (or at least white washed), straight, and christian (or at least sunday morning christians).

okay, fair enough. whether it's 'can't do anything' or 'indirect and slow-acting', it's clear you are trying to say that the federal government can't do *much* and thus defecting responsibility from them. furthermore, you overlooked a gargantuan amount of federal housing policy. i hope my post gives a clear explanation as to what their policy levers actually are and shows people that they actually do have enormous power here.

hgmopp7,2021-10-14T02:43:27.000-07:00,"equalization is a good constitutional bargain. albertans should not vote to scrap it if the federal government slashed their cht and cst payments to the provinces, the provinces would have to raise taxes -- with the most burdened tax bases having to bear the largest increases in the tax rates.

i certainly don't agree about how you are considering the interplay between federal and provincial taxes. i think you're treating them as two separate categories of people (federal tax payers and provincial tax payers). the way i see it, all provincial tax payers are also federal tax payers. so if provincial taxes rise and federal taxes stay the same, households are simply facing a higher tax burden. my model is that households are more concerned with their bottom line -- how much are they paying in tax and what services are rendered. 

i don't think a person in new brunswick would be heartened by the federal government re-directing transfer payments into direct cash for households, under your proposed arrangement, if it causes their overall tax burden to rise and / or service spending at the provincial level to contract.

there's no free lunch -- the feds decreasing cht/cst payments would either be met by rise in taxes either corresponding exactly to the drop in transfers or a drop in service provision. the former is likely regressive -- the poorer provinces have less capacity to raise tax than the richer provinces which is baked into the status quo through their higher tax burden. so those areas are worse off absolutely. whereas an overall reduction in services is likely undesirable given the absense of another 
way to access healthcare resources. this is my chief complaint.

i flatly diagree with you when you assume the transfers achieve nothing tangible -- they smooth tax rates and services provided across all the provinces. lowering the tax burden for people in poorer provinces is a tangible outcome that affect peoples' welfare.

having give it much thought, calling the transfer system inefficient implies not only there is a better use of public money elsewhere, but that absent the public money the activity (providing the social services) would have happened anyway. when government are subsidizing businesses it becomes very tricky to identify if a subsidy is incentivizing behaviour, or just handing out cash and not changing behaviour. but we're not talking about a government subdizing a firm, we're talking about two governments taxing money from one partially overlapping pool of taxpayers. cutting the transfers and causing one section of the taxpayer pool to pay more and another section to pay less isn't an inefficient use of public money because we're just changing who pay how much tax. unless one may argue the transfers are inefficient in the sense that we're providing too much healthcare. which, i suppose is possible but sounds would be tricky to sustain as the cht does not fully cover the healthcare costs of any province.

furthermore the cht funding model does lower the provncial tax rates more in poorer provinces because the cht transfers constitute a higher proportion of that provincial's revenues.

regarding our ability to see the overall effect of the cht funds on overall service provision -- the feds have been funding healthcare through their own tax revenues nearly since we created single payer. in the 60s, it was a revenue sharing agreement between the provinces and the feds, pe trudeau changed it in 1977 to a conditional transfer. chretien consolidated a few transfers in 1997 (iirc) to created the cht and cst. in the meantime, the economics of healthcare changed drastically -- new treatments, new specialities, and the unfortunate reality that productivity in healthcare services tends to lag overall productivity, which means healthcare costs tend to inflate relative to the rest of the economy.

one final possibility is that we cut per capita tranfers to the provinces and convert all transfer to the equalization system. that's certainly more progressive, but provides less certainty to the provinces about gow mich fundig they'll receive in a given year. since equalization payments change each year (even for recipient provinces), provinces will have great difficulty in predicting their revenues beyond three years.

i also worry that the delayed nature of the equalization payments (it's a rolling three year average) would pose difficulty in the event that provincial revenues drop so far and suddenly that a non-recipient becomes a recipient and then we all wait three years for the equalization system to catch up to the business cycle. 

perhaps, the feds would respond by uncapping the stabilization payments which would only ever pay out provinces on the royalty revenue roller coaster -- which tend to be the richest provinces -- oh dear, now we've created massive transfers to the province that needs them least!

the other issue is that the equalization program caps payments so that no non-recipient province ends with a lower fiscal capacity than an recipient. that would have to change in the event we scrapped the cht and cst. but the equalization program as it exists is a difficult fit for the solutions needed in the event that we axe per capita transfers.",liberals

the failed collaboration did not affect canada's procurement of vaccines from other manufacturers, but it did affect canada's _production_ plans.  most notably, this article highlights now the nrc facility was upgraded on a speculative basis to produce this vaccine, and without the collaboration this production is impossible.

as a matter of personal opinion, i'm not too bothered by this.  it's a shame that the plans fell through, but early 2020 demanded aggressive, speculative spending.  if all of our vaccine efforts had worked out, it would have perversely meant that we were too conservative.

at the same time, it was not obvious that china's government would interfere with the cansino collaboration.  the firm had worked successfully with the nrc before (on an ebola virus, i believe).  if there's any condemnation to be had, it would be in the bureaucracy waiting too long before admitting failure.  however, that long delay is almost inherent to bureaucracy, and it says nothing interesting about china or canadian politics.

polls previously have had the pcs ahead in cape breton. this, as well as the mainstreet poll i believe, have put the liberals ahead. the tories did well there last time around so it will be interesting to see how their incumbents hold out.

&gt;voters most likely to vote conservative include those who live in
north end (46%)

i am assuming that they mean cumberland, colchester, and pictou counties. nobody calls it that though so it's a weird choice of words. 

ndp at 25.8% in hrm also can't be a number that they're terribly happy with. they should have a much higher ceiling than that. though i would guess there is a big difference between their support on the peninsula and in dartmouth in comparison to bedford and timberlea. hrm is a big place with very different voting patterns. but unless that split is massive, this probably isn't great for the nsndp.

pcs have some good pickup opportunities in cumberland/colchester, south shore and the valley with some liberals not re-offering.  if they start picking off the empty seats as well as a couple of incumbents then they're going to be having a good day.

the ndp could pick up sydney-membertou, halifax armdale, sackville-cobequid and halifax citadel-sable island (more of a longshot, but that riding should always be within reach for the ndp) on a good day. if they start to do well in ridings like eastern shore or preston then they're having a great day.",liberals

i also just thought scheer was \"meh\" and that bernier had more of a personality. and i thought the ppc was going to make some headway, which they never did and probably never will. scheer also barely had a platform, especially compared to o'toole's that just came out.

as far as i'm aware the whole point of it is to facilitate public health narrowing down the kids that might be more susceptible if there are breakouts (at the time it was measles that was the concern). 

from what i've heard from the higher ups is that its highly unlikely that it will ever be mandatory to be vaccinated. its just not something that they can... mandate. 

so, while i can 100% see having covid immunization to leave the country (and i think they should enforce that), it wouldn't be much different than having to provide proof of vaccinations for other things that other countries do demand for entrance. i'd be so all over making it mandatory (and covered) for all common vaccine preventable diseases to leave the country. i think that if people don't want to vaccinate then they should under no circumstances be going to other countries.",liberals

hbje9fz,2021-09-03T15:42:05.000-07:00,"conservatives would repeal ban on guns used in école polytechnique, nova scotia mass shootings everything you have said has been completely emotional driven hyperbole and exaggeration - and you clearly do not have a real understanding of firearms nor the firearm laws, rules and regulations already in place in this country. 

you are also trying to emotionally manipulate the conversation as you continually go on more details involving the horrible incident which happend at ecole polytechnique and the individual who i will not name as he deserves to be forgotten then the actual legal aspects or talk revolving canadian firearms, laws and regulations - trying to brand and frame those who do not agree with you as being unsympathetic to those who died.

not only are your sources not entirely accurate, some with actual information that contradicts what you are saying - but also some are also irrelevant to this discussion on top of actual outright lies you are perpetuating. 

for example you claim to have posted information from the manufacture- ruger themselves - which say the rifle is not for hunting. not only can i not find that information in any of your posts - but its clearly stated that \"the mini-14 rifle, designed and developed by sturm ruger, is in widespread use as a ranch rifle, defensive weapon, and even a hunting arm\" - no where does it list it not as hunting or ranch rifle. 

you are also specifically referencing and citing an american police magazine made for both the american market and also for those who are not part of the civilians market. they are focused primarily on the police and security industry and are a specialized industry magazine for those who work in security and law enforcement field. the magazine also talks about upcoming rule and regulation changes of interest in the states, other product such as bodycam reviews and suggestions, legal advice, etc for those who are police officers in the united states - which also drastically differ from here in canada in a number of ways on top of the fact that those markets are not comparable to the civilian markets to begin with.

this is also not to mention you can not even keep the name of the firearm you are talking about correct.  you have talked about the ruger m14, the mini14 and now you are calling it the ruger 15 in multiple posts my friend.  this is on top of continually mislabeling them as \"assault rifles\" - which even by the most loose definition of the term, they are not - as they would have been banned in canada in the 70s, and the usa in the 80s with both countries assault rifle bans.

this leads me to both question and scrutinize everything you are posting here and take it with very high skepticism, as you are clearly ill informed on the subject matter.

again my friend, i will highly suggest you go and take both the hunters safety course, the pal course and exam as they are wonderful educational resources for the subject.  i would also recommend reading the 1996 and 2006 revised firearms act.",conservatives

sing did a very good job over the last few years winning canadians over that he is more than just a minority virtue signal pick, but a real and genuine guy.  that he is viewed as most likeable among the leaders is the foundation they need moving forward.  i also think he needs more time with a debate coach and really prep for next year.

trudeau, as much as people may dislike him, is a giant on the debate stage.  super hard to put him off his game as is evidenced by even the random encounters he has with people on the streets.  keep in mind that when he was first elected he did that cross country town hall and that made for plenty of sound bites of him handling protestors like a pro.  but as time has gone on he has to stand on his record rather than platitudes.  that means every election he is more open to a fair attack.  to me that makes for an opening for a repeat of jacks performance in 2008.  now i am not saying that sing should be jack, but he should be ready and willing to demonstrate with facts why the other leaders are not up to the task.",liberals

his efforts to move the party to the centre have not improved the party's fortunes anymore than they have impressed or energized the conservative base of the party.   the poor performance of maxime bernier's ppc should not be taken as an indication that the right is dead - just that they don't want to repeat the whole reform / pc debacle of the 1990's.  the neo-liberal / social conservative base of the cpc is still the dominant force in alberta, saskatchewan and parts of bc (fraser valley / okanagan).  but i don't get the sense that conservatives from the suburbs of toronto are as passionate about the same issues.  i think it will take a very skilled politician to unite these factions and i don't think o'toole is that person.

h3wq91h,2021-07-02T20:54:28.000-07:00,"liberals want to recall the senate to pass conversion therapy bill although the german system sounds interesting, i don't think it would be better for canada than our current system. one of the key benefits of the canadian system, although i admit it is not a guaranteed benefit, is that having appointed positions allows for the representation of certain minority groups which are not represented, or rarely represented, in the hoc. 

minority representation has improved in the hoc over the past 15 to 20 years, but the senate still helps in this regard. 

i also believe that the unelected nature of our senate can allow senators to raise issues and speak their minds without worrying about the next electoral cycle. this is especially true since senators can be independents. although, i admit, this is a double edge sword.

if it ever becomes an elected senate, i suppose i could deal with that, although i doubt it would reduce politicking. i personally think it would increase it. 

on a (long) side note, i'm not open to electing as many positions as the us does. for example, i find elections of lower and state-level judges to be a major flaw in the us system. if judges have to worry about the next election cycle, and fundraising, ect, how can judicial independence be assured? it pretty much can't. the us has many issues in this regard that we don't have to deal with here. 

confirmation hearings for higher courts like the us supreme court are also an issue. they open the door for political interference in the judicial system, especially when the confirmation hearings depend on a elected senate that looks very different from what the us population actually supports (on a proportional basis). we don't hear much about supreme court of canada nominations here. there's sometimes a bit of debate about bilingualism, ect, but our process is almost boring compared to the us. which is a good thing when it comes to the judicial system. 

we also don't describe judges by their political opinion/ which party they come from. to me, this is key, the judicial system should be as apolitical as possible.",liberals

prisoners live in close quarters, spend lots of time indoors, don't have access to a lot of supplies we take for granted (like hand sanitizer). they're high risk for an outbreak. even if you don't care about their health, they interact with people who leave the prison and they themselves finish their sentence and leave, often to communities far from where they're incarcerated. we're all safer if they're vaccinated.

i see you identify as a conservative  party member.
plans aside, are the republican lite tactics acceptable to you? the attack ads and cheap shots like the outhouse stunt? or sloans loaded racist comments about dr. tam? or rempel-garners qanon infatuation? or how about using an american social media company to tweet about how they support canadian business? the new hiring of yet another, non canadian business to advise them on campaign matters? and i would be remiss to not mention the 700lb gorilla of their failure to acknowledge the reality of the climate emergency. which the leader suddenly  announced that he doesn't agree with. does all of that strike you as indicative of the party having the capability, or internal  cohesion to produce a cogent, workable plan when the time comes?

and the bid wars are happening in part because people are so sure they can get a return on the investment and rent it to cover costs until they sell. 

it is ridiculous to me that we are somehow ok with people covering costs on real estate by renting to would be homeowners if only they had larger down payments so that people can make a speculation profit 5 years down the road on third/fourth etc properties. 

the incentives are out of whack. who cares if i have to bid 70k over today if the rent will cover it anyway (because this is what everyone does and there's little choice for renters who want large spaces) and i can sell it for more than that in a few years anyway too (to the moon babbbbbyyyy).

i wasn't aware about that, but it makes sense - an east/west cold war doesn't benefit working people, it only benefits elites, and it makes no sense.  how can a country that makes all of our electronics be an enemy?  

so basically, conservatives have such a paranoid worldview that even vanilla ideas like, \"we should speak to other superpowers and understand their history and culture\" get turned into a conspiracy?",conservatives
gjnvk5e,2021-01-17T07:28:37.000-08:00,"no place for 'far right' in conservative party: o'toole someone’s been feeling the pressure following his lukewarm responses to the far right hoopla in the us. 

this seems to be a major issue for conservative politicians more than others, and that is the ridiculously slow time it comes to accept realities. i get that this is essentially their bedrock. but what blows me away are these tepid, wavering responses to events that, when questioned by opponents/citizens/media/(and yes) their own party they slowly reissue slowly developing/evolving statements.

it just looks so icky. 

sure, we all understand well that they need to cater to all their constituents, and i myself can appreciate that big tent conservatism, while noble in gesture, is effectively a massive challenge, but it just draws out the inevitable. 

on the one hand you don’t want to leave the potential far right and social conservative vote disaffected, yet all this does is invite turbulence when trying to recompense in the wider public eye. the net result is that conservative leaders tend to have to reissue the original statement with amends . . . not once but sometimes two or three additional times. and for what? - just to not offend or lose the harder base? again, sure, i get that, i really do, but perhaps it’s best to arrive closer to where a modern conservative party needs to be in the 21st century the first time around. otherwise, it always feels like they are raising these trial balloons, and by the time their so-called final statement on the matter comes to pass them the public views them with suspect. the lack of conviction is astounding. 

altogether it suggests a lack of proper policy actors within the party and foresight. they should have figured this out by now.",conservatives
gjnvtne,2021-01-17T07:30:57.000-08:00,"jagmeet singh was right to call for trump’s impeachment &gt;partially connected, the final argument was that, as a third-party leader, singh could afford to make these proclamations, but trudeau had to be coy so as to protect canada from trumpian retaliation through measures like tariffs. but not only does this suggest that canada’s ostensibly progressive prime minister should place dollars over essential human dignity, [...]

i should hope that a prime minister would be placing the well being of canadians over some sort of nebulous brownie points for saying the 'right thing', even when that 'right thing' is effectively risking the well being of canadians. 

while i *agree* with singh, that doesn't really make him right, nor does it make his calling for trump's impeachment 'right'. suppose by some miracle singh became canada's pm in 2019; he's already preemptively made an enemy of someone who could, at the time, remain in power for another 5 years, doing god knows what sorts of damage to canada in the meantime. 

trump has never acted rationally, but it's really quite foolish to assume that the limits of what trump could do, or would do, to punish his 'enemies' is limited to what we've already seen.",liberals

it’s not like the party wanted this to be out in the open. it started with zatzman making it public by making these bonehead moves over facebook. obviously the media picked up and latched on to it from there. if they suddenly made all of their proceedings since then super secret it would have raised even more red flags, wouldn’t you agree? what would you say the party could have done differently here?",liberals

surely there are other measures we can take. temp checks, remote voting, sequestering teams. hell i didn't vote on monday because i still have covid like symptoms. that seems like a fair restriction on my voting rights. saying my representative, regardless of whether i voted for them or not, is barred from representing me in government is unacceptable.

ftr i am vaccinated, i will get the boosters when they are recommended for people like me. people who can should get vaccinated. i believe your god will forgive you for getting a vaccine. but i don't think we should be punishing people, specifically thousands of constituents with a diverse beliefs should have there most fundamental rights taken away. this is very different than barring people from restaurants and concerts.",liberals
