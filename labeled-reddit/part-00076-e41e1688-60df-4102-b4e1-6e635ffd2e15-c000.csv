&gt;an examination of expenses filed in the house of commons shows 149¬†liberal¬†mps, or 97 per cent of the caucus, made payments out of their office budgets to data sciences inc., founded by a close friend of justin trudeau.

&gt;the issue of expenses claimed by liberal members of parliament raises ethical questions about whether taxpayer funds are being spent for partisan political purposes.

all parties should only use money from donors and fundraising to campaign and not taxpayer funds. i'm definately not one of those fiscal conservative types who hates government spending but i do expect my taxes to go towards programs to help canadians, not digital campaign services from a company owned by the prime minister's friend. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",liberals

it's certainly not everything the trade union movement wants, but electoral dynamics in canada suggest that federal labour policy will exist somewhere on the cpc-lpc spectrum.  abandoning direct \"access\" to the lpc is a risky game; the party may decide it may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

it's a way for those groups to recruit outside of their normal demographics to bolster their numbers. qanon for instance has had a lot of success at winning over other fringe groups and conspiracy theorists that would traditionally not associate with republican/paleoconservative viewpoints and transforming them into die hard trump/republican supporters (or supporters of other far right populist groups in their own countries outside of the u.s). you also see the same thing with a lot of paleoconservatives or right wing populists labeling themselves as libertarian to make what they're selling more palatable to millennials (people like ben shapiro etc.) or some elements of the \"intellectual dark web\" so there's a lot of tools that are being used to indoctrinate people and co-opt people to effectively win the culture war and defend paleoconservative positions.",conservatives

hatred like this is infectious, and it takes leaders to stop it from spreading. conservatives have failed to stop it from spreading in their ranks, and their attempts to look like they don't stand for it stop at \"we must condemn hatred from all parties\". while not wrong, it avoids accountability for the fact that hatred is at the core of their base.

calling out hatred isn't dividing, it's calling out hatred for what it is. you cannot solve a problem if you don't identify it for exactly what it is. it's the same as when you have people call trying to lift up oppressed groups via policy as racist because you're not giving an incentive to all races. it's not racist. period. and if we allow this dangerous habit of criticizing trying to fix problems, and pretending it's the same thing as the problem itself, we're never going to fix any problems.

equating conservatism as something that is essentially rooted in hatred or saying you cannot hide behind big numbers is the same as mccarthyism where everything that was too left was equated to \"evil communism\". both cases lead to witch hunts to find who to point the finger to and blame for whatever issue we may be facing without actually addressing the problem.


in the case of mccarthyism it led to us politics essentially being completely right wing, even the democrats when compared to other developed countries. thats why witch hunts and pointing fingers doesnt help (in my humble opinion).

a party is people. it's made of people. the people within the party choose the program of the party, the language of the party, and make up the power of the party. as a party, they manifest their power in enacting policies whenever possible, many of which obliquely negatively target specific minorities. they also stir up their voters by repeating divisive rhetoric, especially during campaign years. 

the cpc/opc didn't kill that family, but they certainly did contribute to an environment and society where it was possible someone would (and did) take that action.

the president and board of joe fresh is not technically liable for the 2013 dhaka garment factory collapse, however, the race-to-the-bottom (low prices) led to it through contracts with factories run in substandard conditions and over a thousand died.

khadr was tortured by the us, before canadian agents ever had access to him. by the time canada was involved, his torture was years in the past, and the only issue was his extra-legal detention at guantanamo.

we were and are not responsible for paying $10m to a person whose torture had nothing to do with us. we are probably liable for *some* amount because agents questioned khadr once in the context of an illegal detention, and because harper refused to return khadr for a few years in the late 2000s/early 2010s, but $10m is a ridiculous number for that, that khadr would have been extremely unlikely to achieve in open court.

first of all, they don't control lockdowns to a large extent. that's up to the provinces and phus.

in ontario, we have no date for full reopening, and further reopening is conditional on vaccination targets that may never be met. there is no visible plan beyond the current stage of partial reopening.

the message pushed by the media continues to be that case counts are the primary concern.

since the vaccine doesn't prevent infection, it's reasonable to expect that case counts will start rising again in september and october like they did last year. however, you'd expect them to be mostly non-serious for the vaccinated. it seems clear that this virus is not going away, unless it naturally weakens and goes away on its own.

we haven't yet brought people onside with the idea that high case counts are ok as long as other metrics are under control. to be fair, other countries are struggling to do this as well, but i expect the uk to arrive at a proposal. they have gone full wank on the reopening as of mid-july and are seeing major case count increases but low death rates. they have been about 2 months ahead of us on reopening.

for our messaging, i'd propose focusing entirely on the actual hospitalization and death risk to under-12s and the vaccinated. everyone who wants both vaccine doses will have had the opportunity very soon, so presumably the unvaccinated are happy to take the risk, and we'll have the healthcare resources to handle them.

this will need to become like the flu, where plenty of people get an uncomfortable case periodically; some people get hospitalized; some people die; but largely it does not affect most people beyond an uncomfortable few days of symptoms.

so, unless they get going on that messaging the narrative come election day may be \"well, they opened the borders to us travellers in august; and then they opened the borders to foreign travellers in september; and look at our case counts! we can't reopen and he wants an election gegfwfhjhjsn!!!\"",liberals
h6uqi3o,2021-07-28T03:24:47.000-07:00,"ndp leader promises to end boil-water advisories in indigenous communities yes matters of status natives are federal jurisdiction.

and yes decades of federal governments have been lax on addressing it effectively with plenty of blame to go around, noting the previous most interested government (and the first in many many years prior) to do much of anything to address it was the chretien liberals back in the 90s, and even then it was a pretty poor effort overall (that probably set a lot of examples of mistakes not to make this go around)


the cause of the water being non drinkable to begin with is because of where these people live. these are natural resource (read heavy metals minerals and so on) heavy regions, the water in lakes and rivers and wells isn't good for humans to drink. the problem with the boil water advisories is that it's very expensive to deal with getting these people potable water. because spending a lot of money on small amounts of people living remotely is often pretty unpopular at times with some demographics. these water treatment efforts also need to continuously have money flowing to staff and supply them, which again, big spending by government is often with some people unpopular, in canada, and much of the rest of the world.

it isn't rhetoric to point out that this would be a constitutional crisis for the gg to refuse the request of the prime minister to dissolve parliament. clark asking the gg to dissolve parliament after failing a confidence vote, a confidence vote that indicated she never had the confidence of the house to start with, is a very different beast from what's being talked about here. 

in make the contrast more clear: trudeau currently has the confidence of the house, which means he ought to have all the powers that go with that position, such as the ability to 'request' that the gg dissolve parliament and for that request to be followed. 

it's worth pointing out that the 2008-2009 parliamentary dispute, where harper had the gg close parliament ahead of a pending confidence vote, was built on the well understood authority of the gg to offer the chance to form government to the other parties upon the current government failing a confidence vote.",liberals

in 2015 the liberals campaigned on, and implemented a model of childcare that was effectively a much more generous version of what stephen harper had initiated. this model of childcare was about giving cheques to parents, and a different ideological model of how to provide childcare than the quebec model.

in 2019 the liberals promised money for more childcare spaces, though again not really seemingly pushing for a quebec model, and promised a \"national\" pharmacare plan.

since then, particularly since freeland became mof, pharmacare seems to have faded into the background but seemingly overnight childcare became top priority, with a rhetoric shift to emphasize \"$10-a-day child care\" that echos the bc ndp's policy goals. suddenly as well the liberals had very good things to say about quebec's childcare approach.   


another remarkable change is that the pace at which deals have been signed in this pre-election period has been remarkable in comparison with the slow and steady pace at which the government has approached other issues.

perhaps childcare has been slow and steady progress this whole time, but to my eyes i see a distinct tonal and ideological shift that appeared once freeland became mof and once the liberals decided to push for a new election. i do not think the goal of this government in 2015 was $10 a day childcare. that seems new.

funny i thought the same when you tried to attribute a lack of enforcement of current laws as an *obvious problem* with the **scope** of those laws.

&gt;	have a system that triggers when someone with a firearm licence dies. initiates an automatic investigation into the firearms to ensure they have ended up in a legal owners hands. done deal.

that might work, but i‚Äôd love to see the price tag on such a system. you‚Äôd first need to know which firearms the person owned to know if any are missing, so a gun registry. the last one cost two billion and didn‚Äôt include performing any on-the-ground investigations like you are suggesting. you‚Äôd also need that system to track the deaths of license holders in a timely manner so that the cfo is notified immediately. sounds expensive. 

&gt;	they absolutely did investigate. these people moved because they said his behaviour towards them changed after they reported him.

it seems to me his behaviour changed after they followed up on the domestic abuse claim. feel free to link an article that says that they followed up with him on the firearms claim. from what i‚Äôve read they did fuck all about the firearms. ‚Äú[they said we had to have, like, pictures or proof that he actually had these weapons](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5567774/neighbour-who-warned-rcmp-about-n-s-shooter-s-domestic-violence-says-she-was-scared-to-death-of-him-1.5567781). the nova scotia rcmp¬†say they have no record of forbes‚Äô complaint.‚Äù

this is not relevant. domestic abuse claims are not subject to the firearms act, which authorizes inspections of homes based on reasonable grounds of possession of prohibited firearms (with a warrant). if they did their due diligence on such a serious claim they would have a record of the claim and a warrant application with the courts. reasonable grounds is a low bar. seems like they‚Äôd have ‚Äúreasonable grounds‚Äù given that the claim came from two respected members of the community with military backgrounds that lived next door, said he showed them the prohibited firearms (so they could describe them), and he asked them to use their military connections to get him more firearms and ammunition.",liberals

ndp basically needs to combine the cpc's ideas into their own. if they did this and found a way to merge the two's ideas, they could probably win. not a majority...not the first time round. but a minority? maybe. 

the problem i see with ndp isn't so much the current ideas they have, but more so the extent to which they are willing to bring down the hammer on certain problems like housing affordability. they clearly want to do things to help, but i don't see any parties approach to the foreign investors being enough without combining all 3 of them and increasing each to boot just a bit. 3% instead of 1%, stuff like that. 

i say it has to be that way, because not doing all 3 will just leave one of the other that was left out as a potential loophole to be exploited, yet again. 

that's the true problem of our government's mishmash we call an economy. it's full of loopholes. if you know how to navigate them well enough and don't mind looking like a scuzzbag; you can get away with a lot. aside from new laws being made to fix these problems, typically only 'spirit of the law' tends to get in those jerks ways. i.e. \"you know you shouldn't do this, even if the law says you technically can.\"

using those loopholes isn't inherently bad though either. some are left there on purpose to allow a wise person to save money. but enough about loopholes, aside from saying we need to avoid giving them more.

i know someone who told me that they knew for certain the liberals were going to lose the last election because of what they were seeing on facebook. i asked if they had looked at opinion polls. \"oh, you can't trust those.\" it never occurred to this person that facebook is not merely a window through which they were seeing \"the world,\" but rather something that shows them a highly biased selection of information based on whatever is predicted to maximize the time that person spends on facebook.

this is how you end up with democratic voters who can't possibly understand how so many people vote for trump, and republican voters who find it hard to believe that trump isn't massively popular. these people inhabit different epistemic worlds.

if we want to reduce the toxic impact of social media we need to start there. the platforms are the problem, not the users. the users are simply what has always been understood to constitute the great promise and the great danger of the internet: people communicating their ideas to one another more freely, and it being much easier to find validation for whatever nutty thing they happen to believe, whether they're ufo enthusiasts or new age spiritual stuff or actual nazis. these people exist and they have the right to speak, and if we find their speech reprehensible we have a duty to speak back, but we have neither a duty nor a right to prevent anyone from speaking.",liberals

the uk, new zealand and australia all have bills of rights (indeed, the charter was based in part on the canadian bill of rights, which was itself based on the english bill of rights). in none of those countries do the courts have the power to review or strike down laws passed by parliament. the uk and new zealand actually lack centralized written constitutions altogether. so if those parliaments want to pass a law that applies ‚Äúnotwithstanding‚Äù the existing constitutional order, they can do so. but the court might make a declaration saying ‚Äúthis law doesn‚Äôt align with the constitution,‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt strike down the law, but might create political conditions where the government either has to defend the law or repeal it (in which case, the new law might become part of the constitution).

the carbon tax helps the environment by incentivizing you to make changes which reduce your ghg emissions; it punishes big oil by reducing the amount of their product you are willing or able to buy; it benefits canadians who emit less ghg than average (they get more rebate money than they spent).

how the carbon tax helps the environment is that greenhouse gas emissions hurt the environment, and if the emissions are taxed enough, the emissions will be reduced because the fossil fuel options won't be cost competitive with alternatives which generate less greenhouse gases. to date, the carbon taxes aren't nearly high enough to meet these goals, but they are a step in the right direction.

it is also important that the price on carbon is revenue neutral to the government, that is, they take all the revenue from it and destribute it evenly to the population, this way individuals who emit less than the average get more out than they paid in, giving people an incentive to make choices which reduce their emissions.

you are an interesting case study here \"being a student and worker who drives a lot to make ends meet.\"  as you drive, you are damaging the environment, the carbon tax puts a \"dent in [your] earnings\" which is proportional to the negative environmental impacts you are making, this gives you an incentive to rearrange your life in ways which decrease your greenhouse gas emissions.

 the difficult part here is that you may be in a position where this increase in fuel prices makes your current situation untenable, and you need to make some big changes in order to make ends meet.",conservatives

i would be shocked if the cpc don't make (even small) gains in ontario this time around. the cpc number is t roughly the same or up compared to 2019, but their rural vote is down from losses to the ppc (or so it seams). this to me would imply they're making it up in the urban/sub-urban area improving their vote efficiency, but this remains to be seen. 

but even small swings in ontario could translate to a lot of seats. not including possible change in voting efficiency, improvement from trailing by 8.5% in 2019 to trailing by 4% would translate to ~6 seats according to tctc. a tie would mean gaining ~15 seats from the lpc according to tctc.

to me, that's where his chance is of winning this election. some modest gains in ontario(maybe some small gains in atlantic canada), while letting the bq chip away in quebec. 145-140 is still a win.

assuming you have zero liquidity this is vaguely true in pedantic, meaningless way, but you're still richer and have more stuff every year than the year before, or your tax burden goes down.

&gt;it doesn't matter what i think, we've measured it and people do flee wealth taxes. i know pro-wealth tax people are anti-science, but it's a known fact, like human activity causes global warming or vaccines don't cause autism or whatever other fact gets political pushback.

acting like wealth taxes causing capital flight is some scientific truism is incredibly condescending and mostly serves to demonstrate how poorly you understand science. \"wealth tax\" isn't some binary variable you can study for a simple yes/no answer on a question, it's a single part of an entire ecosystem of interconnected laws and policies which all affect the relative benefits of the tax. whether and to what degree any tax causes capital flight is related to all sorts of factors, including  enforcement mechanisms, thresholds, ease of movement, available alternatives, and about a thousand other things. one particular attempt at implementation can neither prove nor disprove the effectiveness of a wealth tax as a general concept, at best it's evidence for that particular wealth tax not being effective. saying \"france cancelled it's wealth tax therefore they don't work\" is like throwing a glass of water at a house burning down and concluding \"water doesn't fight fire\" because the blaze continued. the details matter, and plenty of economists have concluded that a well-designed wealth tax can be a net benefit for a country.

&gt; i've moved to a new country three times to get my hands on a job that paid \\~$50-$65k cad, so yeah, i can see moving to avoid an additional $250k/year in taxes, even if your after-tax income is somethjng like a million and a half bucks.

using raw numbers when talking about people with extreme wealth is incredibly silly and kind of embarassing. would you move countries for an extra $100 a year? because that's closer to the equivalent relative impact a wealth tax would have on a person worth over $20 million. the marginal utility of money goes down the more of it you have. we're talking about something that would have no impact on these people's quality of life, only a tiny handful of psychotically obsessed money-hoarders would uproot their entire lives for that. trudeau's tax reforms were far, far more impactful on the people targetted (the upper middle class), and yet there was no mass exodus of people making over 200k.",liberals

really?

in 2006 canada negotiated the [residential school settlement](http://www.residentialschoolsettlement.ca/settlement.html) which gave more than [$3 billion to the surviving 28,000 victims](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/iap-final-report-residential-schools-1.5946103) of the residential school system, an [official apology from the canadian government](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1571589171655), and our government negotiated official apologies from the [united](https://united-church.ca/sites/default/files/apologies-response-crest.pdf), [anglican](https://www.anglican.ca/tr/apology/), and [presbyterian](https://presbyterian.ca/healing/) churches for their rolls in the funding, and running of the residential schools.  the catholic church, who ran 3/5ths of the schools has [refused to apologize](https://catholicvoices.ca/issues/indian-residential-schools/) to this day.

as well our federal government [has provided funding and guidelines](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1524504501233/1557513602139) for our provincial governments to add the history of [the residential school system to our public school curriculum](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/aboriginal/curricnsnl.html) so that we are taught what happened, that we never forget, and we never let it happen again.

and then our government spent [$125 million on the residential school healing fund](http://www.ahf.ca/faqs) to help the survivors of the residential school system heal from the trauma caused by the system.

also the government of canada spent [$20 million to fund 144 commemoration projects](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1338475691486/1571582087260).

from 2008 - 2015 canada held [the truth and reconciliation commission](http://www.trc.ca/) which provided those directly or indirectly affected by the legacy of the indian residential schools system with an opportunity to share their stories and experiences.  [the trc was provided a budget of $60 million](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/what-is-the-truth-and-reconciliation-commission/article24717073/) from the federal government.

the trc spent 6 years travelling to all parts of canada and heard from more than 6,500 witnesses. the trc also hosted 7 national events across canada to engage the canadian public, educate people about the history and legacy of the residential schools system, and share and honour the experiences of former students and their families.

the trc created a historical record of the residential schools system. as part of this process, the government of canada provided over 5 million records to the trc. [the national centre for truth and reconciliation at the university of manitoba](https://nctr.ca/) now houses all of the documents collected by the trc.

in june 2015, the trc held its closing event in ottawa and presented [the executive summary of the findings contained in its multi-volume final report](https://nctr.ca/records/reports/), including 94 \"calls to action\" (or recommendations) to further reconciliation between canadians and indigenous peoples.

in 2017 the canadian prime minister went to rome, knelt and kissed the ring and [asked for the pope to apologize, and the pope refused](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/pope-no-apology-residential-school-1.4596439).

in light of the finding of the 215 children's remains [calls to search every former residential school for burial sites](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.6047156/chief-calls-on-feds-to-cut-red-tape-and-find-all-of-canada-s-residential-school-burial-sites-1.6047159), are happening in canada, and the canadian federal government has just revealed they have spent an additional $150 million on 17 private investigation firms who [have found evidence on 5,300 alleged abusers of children](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/residential-school-alleged-abusers-iap-1.3422770) at those schools indicating that trials may begin for the guilty.

h07vns4,2021-06-01T03:57:39.000-07:00,"new governor general should be named by end of june: leblanc once a candidate is chosen, the road to installation is a little more involved than leblanc makes it out to be (though his comments are perfectly fine for a press conference. here‚Äôs some info!

first - **after** vetting, and after the pm has offered the candidate the position and they‚Äôve accepted, it is necessary to seek the queen‚Äôs approval.

her majesty won‚Äôt refuse, but she does take an interest in her representatives, and will expect to be properly briefed about who they are/their accomplishments/what they‚Äôll be bringing to the role. this meeting happened in person when trudeau chose payette (he met with the queen at balmoral while in edinburgh in 2017), and when harper chose johnston (he discussed the appointment with the queen during her 2010 tour of canada). since trudeau will be in the uk in a couple weeks for the g7, such a meeting could happen then.

the announcement will be made after this meeting.

second - the queen will want to meet the incoming gg. in normal times, the chosen candidate is invited to spend a weekend at balmoral with the queen (johnston and jean both spoke fondly about this experience). that probably won‚Äôt be possible this time due to covid (though the opportunity might be granted at a later date). regardless, there are two formalities which will probably be done over zoom:

* the queen will formally ask the candidate to serve as her governor general, and will present them with their commission naming them to the position (and also granting them the rank of commander-in-chief over the canadian armed forces); and
* as sovereign of the order of canada, the queen will make the gg-designate and their spouse extraordinary companions of the order (the highest rank), and will present them with the canadian forces decoration as well.

third - the move into rideau hall and the installation itself need to be planned. unless the gg-designate is a retiree, they probably have other jobs and affairs to wind down and/or put in order, and they might not already live in ottawa. even in situations where there‚Äôs been urgency in filling the position, this is usually a 6-8 week process. of course, it‚Äôs possible to swear them in earlier so they can start carrying out duties (like what was done when the current lieutenant governor of saskatchewan was appointed), but with the administrator of the government chugging along in ottawa, that probably isn‚Äôt necessary.

finally - there‚Äôs the installation itself. this is the easy part. there are three steps that need to be fulfilled to complete the installation:

1) the gg-designate‚Äôs commission must be read out loud in the presence of a meeting of the privy council (in practice, the federal cabinet represents the full privy council here);

2) the administrator of the gov‚Äôt must administer the oaths of office to the new gg; and

3) the newly sworn gg must be presented with the great seal of canada by the minister of industry (which they will accept and then immediately re-entrust to the minister for safe-keeping), and must accept the chains of office as chancellor for each of the three great orders of the state (the order of canada, the order of military merit and the order of merit of the police forces).

it‚Äôs customary these days to hold the installation in the senate chamber, but in the past the setting was the ‚Äúred room‚Äù of the quebec national assembly, or even the nova scotia legislature - since the appointee would usually be installed upon their arrival by boat from britain.

after the installation, the gg will need to appoint deputy ggs who can carry out some of their official duties on their behalf from time to time. the deputies chosen are usually the justices of the supreme court, and the secretary to the gg. the authority they get is limited - signing orders-in-council, royal assent to bills when the gg isn‚Äôt in ottawa, but typically not granting national honours, or the discretionary stuff like proroguing/dissolving/summoning parliament.",liberals

it raises the spectre of hollowing out the public system as private providers can shift away from focusing on the price controlled public market &amp; focus on private care, similar to the us and clinics that don't take medicare/medicaid. conceivably price controls &amp; other regulatory barriers to that could still be applied to privately paid care, but it all feels like a slippery slope to people who believe in a single payer system where you can't skip the queue with money &amp; everyone benefits from improving public wait times etc.",conservatives

gwkm2tt,2021-05-01T04:51:42.000-07:00,"conservative insiders furious after lisa raitt booted from milton riding association from the article, it's hard to tell without more information if they are sabotaging the candidate or if they're just disagreeing with individual campaign decisions.  the former wouldn't be unheard of, but it's spiteful and damaging to the party as a whole.  disagreeing with a campaign decision, on the other hand, may be a legitimate grievance and replacing the board in that case would be extreme.

just my thoughts.  pre-paying a campaign manager isn't very common for political campaigns.  it's not unheard of, especially for a high-profile campaign manager such as parker.  but generally campaign managers, if they're paid at all, are paid a stipend with remaining funds at the end of the campaign.  so a cautious board may prefer spending money on a campaign manager until far later.

also, establishing a campaign office during the pre-writ is risky because campaign offices can be quite expensive.  we're currently 2.5 years away from a fixed election date, so if the candidate establishes an office now and the minority government doesn't fall, the riding association would be on the hook for two year of rent and utilities, costing them tens of thousands of dollars.  it would be a different story if an election was guaranteed a few months from now, but with the ndp and liberals cooperating, no one knows for sure.

so it is possible that there are legitimate reasons that the board may wish to restrain their candidate.  especially if the candidate is inexperienced in politics and/or demonstrating frivolous care for riding association money.

something that happens on some campaigns to solve these disputes is that a candidate will negotiate with the riding association for money.  an example of an agreement is that a candidate would agree to fundraise a certain amount during the pre-writ and in exchange have a portion of that money budgeted to pre-writ expenses.  riding association boards are much more likely to agree to that because it requires less financial risk on their part.",liberals

that said, social conservatives are now typically concerned with abortion, transgenderism and religious freedom, which are much more contentious issues. i don't think either is restricted to evangelicalism as there are other reasons (both ethical and practical) for having concerns about them.

furthermore, the socons maintain a rather small minority anyways. for example, the conservative support for something like gay conversion therapy is minimal (if not non-existent). the debate on abortion is also extremely evaded in the party because they are aware it lacks mainstream support. either way, it seems to me that the party is moving further left regardless, but the tories shouldn't concede too much or else they *are* going to alienate a large portion of the base who may move to a different party if they feel they are no longer represented.",conservatives

as to the 'base' - if you mean that small percent that is into forcing their social will on others the same way the liberals do, they can do what they like but at the end of the day they'd better realize that at least a cpc dedicated to people's freedom will protect their freedoms too - while the liberals will take them away. so they should choose wisely. but yeah seriously - the cpc isn't really a good home for authoritarian zealots.",liberals

we put restraints on what people can do all the time, especially when it comes to harming other people. we even have laws against people commiting suicide, you can't always freely do what you want with your own body. having laws restricting self harm for example isn't dehumanizing someone, that's a ridiculous premise.

&gt; government involvement in abortion is telling a woman what she can/can‚Äôt do with her body, basically taking away rights and boldly autonomy. 

again, we restrict what people can do with their own bodies all the time. an easy example is drug use. you're not allowed to use cocaine even if it just impacts your.

&gt; conservatives saying they want abortion restrictions and less gun control is like telling women: ‚Äúwe want to control your body and also we want more/easier ways to be able to kill you and other people if we want to‚Äù. 

can you try to steel man the opposition? the argument here really is, we want people to be able to own objects that in and of themselves pose no risk, and to not perform an activity if that activity results in the death of a baby.

&gt; if you really want to save lives, try voting for better social safety nets, better schooling, better programs for single moms and kids, better funding for childcare. those seem to go against the conservative values of ‚Äúeveryone for themselves‚Äù, except of course when it come to interfering with women‚Äôs bodies.

you don't know who i am, or what i vote for. this is a talking point for republicans in the us not canada. we have comprehensive sex education in canada...people know how to use condoms and birth control...we don't have crazy teen pregnancy rates. most people that get abortions are in their 20's anyways.",conservatives

canada‚Äôs strategy is to give everyone first shots first so we can get back to normal sooner. thanks to trudeau most of the second shots will actually still be given during the manufacturers timelines.

&gt;
&gt; **whereas** in the post-industrialization era, the labour market has significantly shifted toward the service and knowledge-based sectors with a rise of authoritarian populism, driven largely by a growing sense of economic precarity on the part of working-class people;
&gt;
&gt; **whereas** 6.7 million canadians aged 25-64 do not have university, college or completed apprenticeship qualifications and they have been most affected by the labour market upheaval;
&gt;
&gt; **whereas** the pace of actions to secure for canada a leading position in the transition to transformational low carbon technologies has been slow, particularly in the move toward a hydrogen-based economy and low carbon transportation;
&gt;
&gt; **whereas** providing options for the current skill base of the workforce is critical to acceptance of the needed transitions;
&gt;
&gt; **whereas** risk capital for projects of scale in canada is in short supply;
&gt;
&gt; **be it resolved** that the liberal party of canada urge the government of canada to
&gt;
&gt; - provide meaningful retraining supports, including income and tuition, for workers from designated industries displaced by greenhouse gas reduction measures;
&gt;
&gt; - make direct public investment in transformational projects to create jobs for these displaced workers and facilitate the formation of new greenhouse gas reduction industries in the full spectrum of alternate energy sources - wind, solar, hydrogen, geothermal, nuclear, and hydroelectric;

acknowledging this is the right thing to do and the only way we can morally move forward as a nation.

hiding it, ignoring it or whitewashing it will only prevent any chance of conciliation (i would say reconciliation, but that implies a return to a good relationship, and frankly we have treated the indigenous people terribly since colonization). 

further, we need the younger generations to understand what happened and why it was wrong - otherwise history will simply repeat itself.

the liberals have lifted [107 water advisories since 2015](https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1506514143353/1533317130660). it's not enough and i've often criticized them for not finishing the project in a timely manner. i don't consider them deserving of praise for this since it's clearly the job of the government of canada to provide clean water to everyone in the country and they are just barely doing this. that being said, can you tell me how many the harper government lifted, since you believe they did a better job?

during the h1n1 pandemic, when reserves asked for flu assistance, the harper government sent them [body bags](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/expecting-flu-assistance-reserves-get-body-bags-from-ottawa/article1202910/) instead. during covid-19 the government is vaccinating indigenous communities as a priority and has been reacting very quickly to help with each outbreak. again they don't deserve praise for this either because that's their job and every government should be doing it. why then, was your better tory government incapable of doing theirs?

also the current tory government unanimously voted against the undrip bill that all other parties supported. as they did during the last parliament. weird for a party that's supposedly supposed to be better.

perhaps i'm missing something though and you have an example of how they're better or what they've done? if so, please provide it. i certainly don't claim to know everything and i'm always happy to concede my point in light of evidence.

i'm not happy to have to defend the liberals because they've been neglectful on this issue and need to be doing more but i also find it a bit rich to see how tories and their supporters are suddenly super concerned about this when they never cared before. i just hope it's a sign that they've actually changed and aren't just faking concern as a way to criticize or score political points.",liberals

from the article

&gt; but the federal government has itself been accused of resisting efforts to publish records related to the residential school system and the atrocities that took place within the schools.

&gt; as recently as 2020, ottawa won an ontario superior court case that blocked the creation of statistical reports on residential school abuse claims and the direct transfer of other records to the national centre for truth and reconciliation.

&gt; canada remains in possession of records related to residential schools, though the federal government has signed on to legal agreements that prevent some of the records from being released without the church's consent.

so the church aught to do the right thing and release records, but the people who gave them the authority to run these institutions (i.e. canada) are fighting to block the release of records and have made agreements to not release them.

maybe it was because his dad oversaw these residential schools. i don't know. but it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black.",liberals

the ndp also spent months calling for financial assistance for students which was eventually included after they were excluded from cerb. 

that was mostly just in march/april.

on march 11, the liberals introduced a 10% wage subsidy for businesses. singh brought together a coalition of union leaders and small business owners to press for wage support of 75 per cent. and on march 27, the trudeau government did that, too.

the liberals' initial pandemic response was to expand ei access with an emergency care benefit ($1800/month/15 weeks), boost the ccb, a one-time gst rebate, student loan payment deferrals, 10% wage subsidy, and tax deferrals until august.

the ndp demanded cerb at $2k per month (they wanted it to be universal but the liberals refused) and the wage subsidy to be 75%. they also got the cesb for students boosted to $2k from the liberals planned $1800, got the new crb benefit boosted to $2k when it was planned to be $1600 (in exchange for supporting the throne speech), and convinced the liberals to create the sickness benefit.",liberals

no, it wasn‚Äôt.

&gt;sounds pretty damning.

if you don‚Äôt understand legal reasoning, i suppose it might sound that way. if you do, and you consider that it was referring to one specific factor of one particular part of the fair dealing test, and not the basis of the lawsuit as a whole, it doesn‚Äôt. claiming that one particular factor of a multi-factor test isn‚Äôt met means that it‚Äôs a slapp suit is baldly false. again, this is the same circle you keep running around in.

&gt;no, he was simply arguing it was baseless and poor, i'm using that in support of the main pillar of something being a slapp.

he did not argue it was ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù. why do you struggle so hard to refrain from replacing words by courts and experts with other words that mean different things?

&gt;you're claiming that legal experts thought the cbc had an even chance and could have gone the other way, cite away.

where did i claim that?

&gt;they asked for an incredibly broad injunction:

again:

&gt;\\[3\\] cbc had asked for a very wide ranging injunctive relief preventing cpc from ever reproducing or disseminating excerpts from any cbc news or commentary program. that relief was significantly pared back days before the hearing of its application. the remaining relief requested is a form of declaration as to cbc‚Äôs rights and cpc‚Äôs breach of them. cbc is not asking for a monetary award.

the court‚Äôs statement you‚Äôve quoted from paragraph 111 is a further commentary on the injunction described at paragraph 3. the court clearly felt that ‚Äúinjunctive relief preventing cpc from ever reproducing or disseminating excerpts from any cbc news or commentary program‚Äù would result in ‚Äúa code for the respondents to follow in its political advertising,‚Äù but obviously only with respect to ‚Äúexcerpts from any cbc news or commentary program‚Äù which was what was requested. your attempt to cherry-pick from paragraph 111 leads to a contradiction between the two statements and is unreasonable. the court does not claim that the cbc sought an injunction to literally control every aspect of the conservatives political advertising. i know you want it to be that way, because it feeds the conservative outrage machine, but it‚Äôs not true.

&gt;you pretended that cpc was not sued for a clip of scheer speaking then in the same post argued that they were justified in being sued for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;you cited the summary where the judge acknowledged the concerns but omitted the judge stating those concerns have no basis in reality.

nope.

look, we can keep going on this but you have, among other things: misapplied u.s. law to canada; admittedly lied about what canadian law ‚Äúenshrines‚Äù; repeatedly altered court and expert statements to claim they said things that they didn‚Äôt; and, repeatedly confused a lost lawsuit with a slapp lawsuit. i realize you can come back yet again and say, ‚Äúcbc lost so it was a slapp,‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt make you right. it just makes you yet another conservative cbc-hater whose victim complex drives them to lie and make ridiculous claims. i‚Äôm not sure how often you need to keep doing that to demonstrate the point to everybody else.",conservatives

your example is also wrong. for example, say a teacher began going off lesson and just preaching to children. that would be sanctionable and marks a good constraint on their right to religious liberty (which is a s. 2 protected right).  deviating from the material to proselytize has potential to harm students (if for no other reason than slowing their education in the material at hand). 

similarly, canada has upheld safe zones around abortion clinics to prevent protesting or intimidation - notwithstanding claims around both speech and religious liberty.  because there's a balancing of rights.

further, there are numerous times when authorities have had laws struck down/read down, or had their actions invalidated, due to violations of speech or assembly guarantees under s. 2.
