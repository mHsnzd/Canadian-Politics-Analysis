i would agree, but perhaps you won't agree with my reasoning.   

here's the thing, the vaccine, just like all vaccines are generally simple medical procedures.  when i started travelling abroad, i got the hep a and b vaccines, to ensure i didn't get hep.  i have been immunized for all of the standard viruses over the years, including small pox.  consequently i have never had easily preventable diseases like measles, mumps, or rubella, nor whooping cough, hepatitis, tetanus, polio and probably several more that don't come to mind.  to my knowledge i have never had covid, but only been tested once, and if i had it, it was completely asymptomatic.  my wife on the other hand, has had it twice now.  my only brother had it, my only niece had it.  everyone in my family who has had it, is still suffering some side effects of it.  so when i have to choose between not getting sick and potentially dying as i'm 51, and getting a vaccine that thusfar has killed 0 canadians, and made very few sick, i'll take the vaccine every day, as that's the smart thing to do for myself and for everyone around me.   

now there is some nonsense about this being a political ploy.  it is, but that is being pulled by the anti-vaxx crowd.  think about it, how is denying taking a safe and effective vaccine in anyway a political move?  do people who refuse to take a medical treatment, think they are sticking it to their favourite hated politician?   mostly they are screwing themselves, but there is also an impact on those who can't get vaccinated.  i mean to imply that the government or the media has made this political is absolutely insane.  if justin trudeau said he wanted to make sure that all diabetics had access to affordable insulin, would you think it's a smart political process for diabetics to refuse their insulin, just to stick it to trudeau?  everyone would call that person an idiot, and get mad at them for wasting public health resources when they invariably end up in the hospital.   

so yes this has become a political hot potato for some, as in those who don't want to take the vaccine.  for everyone else, it's just the smart thing to do, like going for a daily walk.",liberals

my problem with the conservatives is their criticism is mud slinging, they’re not offering alternatives or explain what they would’ve done differently.

it isn’t worth entertaining the idea of three years since it’s impossible. we procured more than enough, plus children still aren’t recommended to vaccinate as trials are still not done. not to mention not all adults want to be vaccinated. we don’t need 100% vaccination rate. 70% would probably do.",conservatives

1. canada doesn’t have an active facility for producing mrna vaccines, due in part to the privatization of connaught labs decades ago. the earliest that such a facility can come online is july. 

2. every single supplier was asked to manufacture vaccines in canada. all of them said no.

3. the government can’t control production issues that occur on the part of the suppliers. 

and right now, we’re receiving hundreds of thousands of doses weekly and are well on track to meet q1 delivery timelines.  the pm doesn’t have a magic wand that will allow him to suddenly make vaccines appear.  and the pm has set a clear deadline of september to have all canadians vaccinated—the success of which is linked directly to the ability for the provinces to administer the shots.  in all, you’re jumping on the “trudeau failed on vaccines” bandwagon far too prematurely.",liberals

&gt; some insiders also view ford as being less susceptible to the influence of lobbyists than he is just prone to trying to help anyone who gets in his ear. “he wants everyone to like him,” said one political strategist and lobbyist who has known ford for years. “so he tends to be a little bit all over the map. it’s part of the problem with him, but it’s also a little bit, quite frankly, part of his charm.” that, more than lobbying, some believe, explains ontario’s erratic covid response.
&gt;
&gt; but not everyone agrees with that interpretation. many lobbyists and political insiders, including some conservatives, argue that what has happened under ford goes far beyond the normal interplay between business, partisans and government. “i will say this, they listen to lobbyists, the ones who are connected. that’s how you get stuff done with this government,” said a second conservative lobbyist.
&gt;
&gt; and regardless of who was representing them, it’s undeniable that during the pandemic, the government made decisions, again and again, that tacked with the interests of well-connected businesses. and while it can be hard to say in any specific case why the government made one choice over another, the correlations between what those businesses asked for and what the government did were often striking.

even if you’re fully vaccinated, you still need to do a pre-arrival test as well as a test when crossing the border for tracing potential cases (at least by air), so i would wager the likelihood of a fully vaccinated person testing negative within 3 days before travelling bringing covid along and being an infection risk is likely pretty low.",liberals

most $20m companies can't afford that to pay their ceo that much.  you would need to sell ownership of you company (which is almost impossible nor desirable with private companies) or you would need to take debt (which small companies have too much already) or you would need to make cuts elsewhere and most likely your regular staff and your customers will foot the bill.  so much for fixing wealth inequality.

&gt;you definitely said that québec is undeniably the most racist province of the country, which is a lie based on nothing. stop lying, admit that you have some very strong biases despite not knowing a lot about the province.

quote it then, if it is true. 

&gt;québec isnt more nationalist than any other province, but québec nationalism is just different from canadian nationalism. i’m not even a nationalist, i wouldn’t call myself a separatist, but québec separatism isn’t worse than canadian nationalism. québec nationalism can be bad just like all kinds of nationalism, but many people in the separatist movement aren’t even that much nationalist. there is racism in the province, but separatism isn’t racist. the province is, overall, not more racist than any other canadian province, even tho i recognize that racism exists here.

americans say the same when they get called out about that. it's patently false too. 

&gt;the fact that you think that separatism is dumb (‘’unnecessary’’) or that québec is offered a preferential treatment compared with other provinces is a proof that you deeply misunderstand québec.

i think separatism is unnecessary. when the wexit garbage happened, i thought it was unnecessary too. why should i paint quebec's separatism differently? 

when did i say that quebec has preferential treatment? on multiple occasions i've told you that i have no issues with quebec's special status. i am in favor of bilingualism, and i learned french myself. so i don't know where you are getting this. 

i think you just want to avoid the issue. every time that something new is brought up you move the goalposts further.",liberals

germany didn't stop being germany because it became ruled by a genocidal dictator. we have also still recognized many countries that have had their governments continuously in contention, and have not been stable. i'd look to egypt on that matter, though i am not particularly sure if that 100% qualifies in this instance.

also canadians are already struggling to get by and half the country is like $200 away from serious financial hardship so no they won't pay more either. 

this is the same reason why no gov't will ever sanction chinese goods we all rely on because any gov't that raises the cost of living like that will be replaced. canadians will take notice at checkouts, opposition parties can hammer away in short clips and the average canadian doesn't give a shit about this they just want to get by.

we have known for a very long time that our encroachment on animal habitats would lead to diseases jumping from them to us. we know this for a fact yet we continue to do it at every turn.
we also knew for a long time that with climate change will come a growing trend of pandemic level diseases/viruses and still we make no real changes to our behaviour.

i'm not anti vaxx by any means but i don't have faith in a vaccine being able to bring us back to what was. i will get vaccinated no doubt and it's great they are developing them but i don't think it will be the silver bullet everyone is banking on.

even the mutations and variants you address, what if variants mutate together and create an even worse virus?
i did see an article a week ago saying they believe exactly that has happened however it was not picked up by any mainstream and while the source was somewhat reliable i'm still not confident saying that information is factual. i do think it is worth pondering but it is not worth getting worked up over until we know for sure this has happened. however i still see many saying that it isn't possible and plenty of people acting like everything will just get figured out because all they have known is western stability. so they can't fathom or comprehend a world where they don't have that, these things are problems of the poor nations in their minds, it's not possible to happen over here in places like the us or canada.

stuff like that scares me because it means we aren't prepared and won't because so many can't confront the idea that maybe we have peaked and this is the start of a decline. everything comes to an end and i don't mean some movie level world ending event. just that things will change in ways we never expected or experienced, that we are walking into a new world with our eyes closed holding on to the fantasy of the old one.",conservatives

guncv1e,2021-04-15T06:48:09.000-07:00,"conservatives' climate plan would replace liberal carbon tax with lower one of their own let's be clear, this is an **even worse policy** than i originally thought.  the key here is the difference between how money is allocated to personal savings accounts vs carbon rebates.

**carbon rebates**

the current system takes a projection of the amount that will be taken in from a province, divides that by the number of people in the province, and distributes it out basically pro-rata. so if you consume less than the average amount, you actually *make money* on the rebate. 

so if tom is a huge carbon user and pays $10k in tax (direct and indirect), and harry is a green conscious guy and only pays $500 in tax, they split that and each get $5,250. tom takes a big loss, harry gets a big win.

that incentivizes everyone to cut back on carbon - the more you cut back the more \"profit\" you make - unless your other citizens cut more than you do... so get cutting!

**personal savings account \"plan\"**

the cpc \"plan\" doesn't aggregate and distribute pro rata. based on what they've released so far, the cpc plan just transfers the carbon tax amount you spent into a savings account with your name on it. so say you're tom get \"taxed\" $10k in a year... you get $10k to spend from the government. if you're harry that doesn't use carbon - you bicycle to work, you have solar panels on your roof, you are super green, and only pay $500 in tax... you get $500.

you might recognize that this creates the exact opposite incentive - you're now incentivized to **buy the least carbon efficient thing**. this is the worst possible plan ever for doing this. o'toole is bad and should feel bad.",conservatives

the point is to raise revenue. if we wanted to \"diminish\" wealth the tax would have to be higher than the average return rate of capital. bernie sanders proposed wealth tax of 8% on fortunes above $10 billion is aggressive enough ot *maybe* reduce a person's wealth. a 1% tax is just asking the ultra-rich to contribute a little bit to society as their wealth continues to explode year after year.

&gt; but france is hardly the only example; they're the easiest example because they've been really public about how it didn't work and french sources are easier for us canadians.

if you see a bridge fall, is your conclusion \"bridges can't work\" or \"bridges designed and built in that particular fashion can't work in that location\"? there are enormous differences between the french wealth tax and the ndp's proposal, many of which specifically address the shortcomings of the french experiment. since there is no real-world example of any similar plan, the only way to test its efficacy would be to actually implement it. 

&gt;if raw numbers are too hard for you i'm sorry to hear that, but i think you're shying away from it because it undermines what you're trying to pull off.  it's not hard to evaluate the relative impact of $250k in taxes on an take home income of a million and a half dollars or whatever.

and if it were a 250k fine on people with high incomes you might have a point, but considering it's entirely unrelated to income it's a complete non sequitur to try and compare it to an income tax. a person making $1.5 million a year could be subject to a wealth tax of $0 or $100 million dollars depending on their net worth. 

&gt;trudeau tax reforms are much smaller than a 1% wealth tax would be; the marginal tax rate went up 4% on incomes, but a 1% tax on wealth is equivalent to taxes going up at least 10% on income,

this statement is entirely made up and has no foundation whatsoever. it's really hard to believe you're a \"scientist\" when you make such glaring errors. 

&gt; and one that's harder to absorb in the event of an economic downturn or the like, so it's an increased risk. 

it's a significantly decreased risk because you literally become exempt if your net worth ever falls to $20 million, a number 99% of canadians will never make in their entire lives.

two reasons. first, if your vaccine supply is low, then one should logically be battening down the hatches and locking down harder and longer... not reopening and rolling out soft measures while complaining about lack of supply (see ontario). second, if they are squandering the supply they are given (see also ontario, where there are plenty of reports of unbooked/unfulfilled appointments, age targeting that hits people who are low risk in terms of exposure/transmission, all the while essential workers go unvaccinated)

would more vaccines help? absolutely, but that's asides the point and it's really just crying over spilled milk at this point seeing as there is nothing *any* federal government can do about that unless they invest in a time machine to warn mulroney/chretien/martin/harper to not kill (or invest in) our domestic production capacity.",liberals

it also unfortunately works, because when someone is told that someone is untrustworthy 400 times each day, eventually they start to believe it, even if they wouldn't normally. policy on the other hand doesn't have that same effect, because they're \"just two different solutions to the same problem\" and \"both could be correct answers\" so arguing policy doesn't sway people as hard as arguing against the people. nobody wants to support hitler, but if you bring up tarrifs on imported products, well, suddenly that's not as catchy of a subject, people aren't immediately and violently against it, even though it was one of hitlers policies. heck, people will probably attack me over mentioning anything to do with hitler in a not-negative light rather than the point itself, which will actually help prove my point if it happens.

&gt;  today, respecting your losses and ours and in their memory, i would urge canada to remain engaged with the humanitarian, education, health, agri-business and natural resources/minerals files. engage the taliban at all levels to impress on them good governance and human/women rights. do not disengage. .... i come from a background and family that has fought and promoted democracy in afghanistan for the past 60 years. i also believe that nations need to develop their own indigenous models of democracy or pluralism. i no longer believe in imposing a particular model by will or by force. we need to do whatever it takes to allow men and women to be part of a system that is participatory and based on consultation and, ultimately, voting rights. in our case, we sabotaged democracy over the past 20 years and lost the trust of the population. we need to rebuild trust and let them organically build their own democracy. i hope that freedom of expression/media, movement and participation in civic and political affairs are protected and reformed as we try to build a new system that will be influenced by islamic values and traditions.

there is definitely a desire to right the wrongs of the last 20 years, and i think we should use this as a starting point. our occupation of the country, no matter what good it may have done, is now undoubtedly a failure. if we refuse to engage with the new government, we abdicate a capability to do what little we can after such a tragic failure. denying the new reality will not help afghans, any more than acknowledging it will hurt them.",liberals

janis irwin is the ndp mla in that area now. she's pretty popular and a really strong campaigner. she's been out with the federal candidate, blake dejarlais, almost daily.

it's not a seat at the table. it's control. the board of directors controls the company.

&gt;private sector unions barely exist in canada anymore, because of weakened laws.

yes, because unions are harmful to companies. if there's a match between arsenal and an u14 girls team, arsenal is still going to win if you slant the field in favour of the girls. the fact that they lose doesn't mean the field is slanted against them.

it's illegal in canada to fire employees for trying to form unions. what laws are there that slant things against unions? there are none.

&gt;nobody is advocating for taking away property rights, you're being absurd.

handing control of a company over to the employees is a loss of property rights. by enabling unions and giving control to the employees, the employees will force companies to raise wages to the point where the profits will disappear. thus, there would be no incentive to investors to invest their capital. this will slowly erode the capital stock in the country, lowering demand for labour, resulting in lower wages.

liberal governments have brought us the charter, gay marriage, cannabis legalization, the ccb (that's had a huge impact on child poverty), added a new tax bracket on the upper end, enacted a carbon tax despite extreme opposition, improved voting access and are taking good steps towards improving the relationship with first nations.  they're making small steps on affordable housing, pharmacare, and child care.  trudeau's releasing the liberal senators and the process for appointing better senators was extremely impressive.  it's very rare for politicians to do something that's good for the nation, but bad for their personal power.

i mean i know why the chretien liberals were considered corrupt, why the mulroney pcs were considered corrupt, and definitely why the current trudeau liberals are seen as corrupt.  but i don't know how that can be applied to harper.   

harper had such meaningless scandals like a $12 orange juice, body bags being delivered to a reserve that ordered body bags,  gallows humour from a minister in a closed meeting, a minister leaving a briefcase at his girlfriends, building a gazebo in a place where a g8 meeting was supposed to take place but having moved the venue to toronto because it was later identified as security risk, etc ...

and the one that sunk him was how $90,000 got paid into taxpayers which later turned out not to have been necessary (read that again: a scandal on how money was paid to taxpayers that shouldn't have been!).

i mean i know the harper government made mistakes, i didn't agree with everything they did, but they hardly seemed a corrupt government, they were so unlike the the current liberals who's policies are to help their friends, they even had a finance minister pass legislation that benefitted his family business, they clearly have an unhealthy relationship with snc lavalin, kpmg and other rich friends and donors; they even bring disrepute to their charitable friends like the kielburgers and aga kahn.",liberals

but those aren’t cases where a staffer *actually* did it, those are cases where a staffer is made the fall guy.  at least that’s how it looks to me.

in any case, tweeting doesn’t cost money so this is different, either way.

if the cpc produced a commercial (and believe me, they paid somebody good money for this monstrosity) and then let a junior staffer release it as if it was their own, first of all it might be illegal during an election (there are strict laws on spending and accounting) and when they got caught they would look even worse politically.

moreover, even if their staffer posted it publicly the party would have to renounce it and fire that staffer or stand by it.  what is gained other than a mess?

especially considering that they would have to decide to back it with an ad buy or not… that’s how these things get front page coverage.  if they support the message (and eot definitely does) they want to make it stick.  can’t achieve that on a private facebook post very easily.

now - they may have thought perhaps thats a level playing field for all the parties but i think it may affect them and the ndp more, and the bloc and the cpc less.

voter turn out is also largely dependent on the gotv (get out the vote) efforts of the party and that requires volunteers. and they may be harder to come by. 

trudeau doesn't really have much of a reason to offer people to put in the effort to get out and vote. there's no 'scary harper' to fall back on, nobody thinks the cpc is going to win, and the ndp is the liberals bitch so who cares if it's a minority? and they're getting  nervous about the debt and deficit and 'i'll spend more of your cash\" isn't a huge draw anymore for many of the middle libs.

anyone who actually bothered to interact and get to know the indigenous people without supremacist attitudes understood and respected them as a people. the early traders who actually interacted with the indigenous people respected them greatly. the ability to disconnect oneself from empathy towards various groups of people, does not excuse destructive behavior towards those groups. they made the wrong choices and should not be excused from that.

history is filled with men and women who were given control of regions and ruled without bothering to understand the people they ruled.  this is called poor leadership and is recognized as such in any era. machiavelli wrote extensively about these concepts in \"the prince\", in the 16th century. we have had a very good understanding of what is required to properly manage conquered indigenous populations for over 3000 years.  had macdonald been a good leader, then he would have bothered to try to understand the indigenous population as separate tribes with their own very unique customs and ways of life. this would have allowed him to craft policy for the indigenous people.

then aside from all that there is his actual performance as prime minister. if he were doing the job today, people would be making the same complaints about corruption and hypocrisy as trudeau. the pacific scandal and all of his political maneuvers are exactly the same thing we see in trudeau.  had macdonald been less greedy and more committed to the rule of law, it could have set the example for pms to follow. but instead he laid the bar real low for those that followed. in the history of leaders  that came before and after, he would do very poorly in my opinion.

the ndp meanwhile still can't seem to decide whether or not they support carbon pricing.",liberals

at this point, we aren't voting on a pandemic plan either. if it was, the election would have been last summer. instead, it seems we're voting on who would have the best plan to recover now that the pandemic is on its way to ending. we have several vaccines, we're soon to have vaccine passport system in much of the country to reduce its spread even further. the pandemic, while not over, isn't the over-riding issue moving forward.

h91o4ew,2021-08-15T02:21:05.000-07:00,"trudeau calls federal election, voters to go to the polls sept. 20 i get where you're coming from on this, but there is currently no mechanism by which you can actually ensure that all canadians \"automatically\" get mail-in ballots that would be in any way reliable and secure. 

there is far too much regular churn in people changing addresses, losing stuff, making dumb mistakes, etc. for it not to present a host of unnecessary problems, and this is before we account for canadians who have a right to vote but no mailing address at which to receive a ballot. there would also be just a tsunami of issues if they suddenly tried to do this *right now*, as hundreds of thousands of young voters will be moving to dormitories and residences here or abroad over the next couple of weeks. some such students already have enough regular trouble figuring out whether they should vote in their school's riding or in their families', and that's a problem that has been solved for ages and on which information is already readily available. introducing something totally novel with no advanced notice would be far worse.

keeping the vote secure is another matter. the incidence of any \"voter fraud\" in canada is so low as to be almost non-existent, and this has allowed elections canada to offer a pleasing amount of latitude when it comes to how people vote and what they must present or attest when doing so. that being said, requiring that those who wish to vote without presenting themselves in person must first give formal notice of this is an extremely low bar of security to clear. there is so little to gain otherwise by a scenario in which millions of legal ballots end up moving around the country unsupervised, and without any prior engagement with their intended recipients.",liberals
