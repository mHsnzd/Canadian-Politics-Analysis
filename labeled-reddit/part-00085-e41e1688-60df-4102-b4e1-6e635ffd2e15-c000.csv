may be good to look for another gp as many gps are able to perform a lot of services and will prescribe treatments to account for long wait times. for example some gps won't prescribe acutane, some will. some aren't comfortable inserting iuds, some are.

canadians know we're trying to buy the most desirable product in the world right now, it's going to be a tough marketplace. but, at the moment, we're actually succeeding, thanks largely to trudeau and the feds working the phones and leveraging those old diplomatic ties with the us and the un establishment. 

the vaccine crazies were largely not going to vote liberal anyways. the far left anti-vax crowd had a pretty nice lead in the anti-wifi green party, and the right wing freedom hawks were largely pcs anyways.

 most of us realize the government is going to give up these quarantines and executive powers after the pandemic is over, because the idea of trudeau leading a power-drunk despotic regime a la stalin is a right-wing fever dream. the man just wants to party with the rich and have people applaud his progressive low-hanging fruit harvesting, this pm gig is just to keep the party going. 

everyone knows the ndp won't win anything without quebec as it currently stands, and the greens have like 2 seats and no leaders with national standing. i can't actually name a green party member off the top of my head, beyond elizabeth may, and i'm pretty left-wing. there's very little point in throwing support to either party when that could result in a darker decade of conservative rule again, in the eyes of most left-leaning canadians.

the tories tested the attack ads with focus groups, which was the standard technology at the time.  the focus groups thought the attack ads were awesome.

after the campaign, the academics at communications studies departments realized that something had gone wrong. the focus groups had approved the ads, which had spectacularly backfired. that's bad - focus groups are supposed to be a technique that gives you ads that work.

eventually they figured out the problem. standard operating procedure for focus groups was that the focus group members don't have any preconceptions, so you can test the effect of the ad (or whatever) without bias from preconceptions.  so the people running the focus groups made sure that the focus groups were exclusively made up of people who didn't know that chretien spoke that way because of a physical defect.

so the people in the focus groups assumed that chretien was speaking that way because he was goofing around, or something, and with that assumption they thought the ads were effective.

a few years after the election, a communications studies academic ran an experiment where they repeated the focus groups with americans who didn't know who chretien was. the focus group members thought the ads were effective.  then the academic told them that chretien spoke that way because of a birth defect and asked if that changed their opinion of the ads.

this is just not true. at all. 

every single edmonton seat was won by the cpc with an absolute majority **except** edmonton centre (and obviously strathcona).  i detail the numbers and cite my sources below. so most edmonton ridings were won with majorities in **both** the federal and the provincial. the only way that math works is if a significant chunk of the abndp vote went cpc federally

edmonton centre - 41.45% plurality victory - (2015 34.95%) +6.5% 

edmonton greisbach - 51.36% **majority victory -** (2015 39.96%) +11.4%

edmonton manning - 55.95% **majority victory -** (2015 45.24%) +10.7%

edmonton mill woods - 50.28% **majority victory** **-** (2015 41.06%) +9.2%

edmonton riverbend - 57.44% **majority victory** **-** (2015 49.89%) +7.55%

edmonton strathcona - 37.07% plurality loss - (2015 31.28%) +5.8%

edmonton west - 60.92% **majority victory** \\- (2015 49.33%) +11.6%

and then i wont bother with the commuter communities

across the urban ridings they increased their vote by more than 5% in **every single one**, for an average increase of 9%. even in the riding they actually **lost**, they were  still up 5.8 points election over election. 

in terms of raw vote numbers, they increased their vote by either roughly 4 thousand raw voters, or  roughly 10 thousand raw voters depending on the riding. so it's not like their vote stayed flat, and left wing people just stayed home.

as to the conservative take on this, i don't really buy that they're that wed to the principle of each level of government staying in their lane. just look at the ford government in ontario, stomping all over muni governments in areas that really have nothing to do with provincial jurisdiction.  o'toole is recognizing the populist demand for housing that isn't insanely expensive and that's a subject that transcends left-right partisanship.  he'd rather interfere with municipal governments than the private sector real estate and development industry because those are some of his backers and funders.

mr. singh is not required to go knock doors for the bcndp during the pandemic. he is not required to make speeches nor phone calls for the bcndp, actively *supporting* not just horgan. he is not required to vote in a provincial election, particularly during a pandemic, he’s certainly not required to make a video telling people how he voted and that they should leave their homes during a pandemic to vote.

he most certainly was not required to travel across bc during a pandemic before *anyone* was vaccinated going from swing riding to swing riding to push out *green* party candidates (yeah that’s who they needed to get rid of they already had minority government).

 it was a cynical bcndp to get rid of the greens and form a majority government. oh yeah, you know all that old growth logging? yeah that’s what this is *really* about, getting the greens out of a leverage position so that horgan could do that. those sweet sweet union logging jobs. that’s what mr singh was fighting for lolololol he wasn’t fighting the bclibs he was fighting the bcgreens and their pesky tree hugging getting in the way of union members getting over time pay while the chainsaws go brrrrrrrrrer

oil itself has a wide range of industrial uses, though obviously at far smaller quantities then the extraction we see today. in a context where emissions are punished sufficiently the natural gas that tends to be extracted alongside liquid oil will become more and more of a liability.

alberta's oil sands don't come with that natural gas and if they could manage to do their separation without burning natural gas ( nuclear heat for example ) you might get an oil product for less emissions then the usual liquid crude that has to do *something* with the natural gas, even if it's just flaring it off.",liberals

in the case of the mri's in saskatchewan you have a line of people waiting for diagnostic imaging. in that line you have people willing and able to pay to speed up their process. i agree that them being able to pay an amount to jump the queue in a strictly public system is wrong. but if there was a private option that say for every 9 private paid mri's provides 1 public mri  we have essentially removed 10 people from the line. the people unable to pay move up in the line and receive better/quicker service.  use the tax revenue from these procedures to continue improving the public system. this only works if public capacity does not correspondingly drop with the increased private options which would need to be regulated.

socialized medicine is part of the core of what makes canada different from the us and should be protected. i just believe we should look to our allies with higher rated health care systems to see what is working for them and create a canadian version that improves our system for the most people.

while at the time this might have been a halfway excusable choice the years provided many reasons to regret this, from the years of messy but extant democracy in india vs pakistan swapping to/from military dictatorships, to a ~little~ pretty sizable genocide that lost them their eastern half to the more recent double dealing with the taliban. unfortunately foreign policy positions have calcified significantly since wwii so instead of taking in any of this information as a hint that pakistan wasn't a friend worth having they were forgiven their trespasses because they're our 'friend' where the same actions by a geopolitical foe would garner ( appropriately ) a whole lot of criticism and perhaps even action. the fact that they became nuclear armed over this period only further complicates things.",liberals

my dad used to work at the hospital and told me an interesting story about the mri clinic there. basically the government would pay the staff to operate it during the day, but it wasn't being used at night, so the hospital got approval to basically rent it out at night. they weren't allowed to do private healthcare services since the machine and hospital are publicly owned, so they would mostly be renting it to veterinarians.  


this was all fine, the vets would pay the mri staff to run the machine at night, the hospital would get some extra money to help fund the normal healthcare, things like having one more icu nurse on staff so they could spend more time with each patient during their shift, etc... and it didn't have any negative impacts on the mri clinic during the day.

what i took away from last nights debate is trudeau is able to defend his actions and progress over the last 6 years. at least, to a degree moreso than someone who doesn't even have proof of their past since they've never been in power. in writing this i realize so many other issues with it all, such as voting for the party or voting for the pm rather than voting for the cabinet. if the liberals failed, shouldn't we hold the pc accountable for the actions of the previous pc government? no of course not, because the cabinet is completely different. its a completely different party. so then how can we have partisan ties to a party when there's no link each time the party is campaigning for office?

maybe we ad voters should be more informed on who is making up the party and where the cabinet individuals stand on issues, rather than how good the figurehead is at talking or what their campaign manager wrote in the pamphlet.

i will say this though, i used to be a liberal supporter, i was a party member, i’ve donated before even. but i personally have grown to dislike trudeau. i wanted change from harper in 2015, and then supported him again in 2019.

maybe there are other people like me who just want something a bit different. the real question i guess is just how many people there are that feel similarly. but in my opinion, i believe more people want him to stay than go.",liberals

(otherwise, you'd have a very obvious opportunity to take over local riding associations and run a conservative as the \"lpc\" candidate and another conservative as the cpc candidate.)

i was basing myself on some reading notes of mine from a few years ago, in which i took some shortcuts. you're right that the 1970 elections act didn't change anything in parties themselves. what i should've said is that what the act changed was that party labels now appeared on ballots, and that parties became responsible for telling elections canada which candidates would be labelled as officially theirs. before that -- and especially before the second world war -- lots of candidates ran as \"independent liberal\", \"ind. conservative\", etc. even under trudeau sr., one of their mps ran as \"liberal-progressive\". there's some interesting cases where there were multiple candidates running as liberals in a given riding, for example.",liberals

i've always considered myself a liberal. also a liberal having voted for trudeau twice.

when kamloops first broke i imagined \"mass graves\" and thought of images from the holocaust. that's how the media presented it.

then i read more into it and realized the deception. i'm not denying residential schools were bad or anything nut job like that, just the way they framed it really angered me. i felt manipulated and finally saw why the right think the media is biased.

i attended a presentation given by a fn woman around the time the 700 in sask were announced. she said exactly what that chief said because she visited a lot of the sites. everyone there already knew the graves existed. this wasn't a new discovery. the only thing new was the use of radar. 

people love to say how the last school closed in 1996 and how there's still people alive who went there and worked there. so how could these graves have been forgotten about if people who knew about them are still alive!?
