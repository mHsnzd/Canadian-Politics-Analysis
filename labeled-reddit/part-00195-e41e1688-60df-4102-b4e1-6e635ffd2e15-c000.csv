https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jenica_atwin

&gt; jenica atwin is a canadian politician who was elected to represent the riding of fredericton in the house of commons of canada in the 2019 canadian federal election. atwin was the first member of parliament of the green party of canada to be elected outside of british columbia and the first woman to be elected in the riding of fredericton. in june 2021, she crossed the floor from the green party to the liberal party of canada. 
&gt; 
&gt; atwin was elected to represent the riding of fredericton in the house of commons of canada in the 2019 canadian federal election, defeating incumbent mp matt decourcey.[11] she was the first member of parliament of the green party of canada to be elected outside of british columbia, the first \"third party\" candidate to win the electoral district of fredericton or its predecessor districts (which have traditionally alternated between conservative and liberal mps), and the first woman to be elected in the riding of fredericton.[12][13] along with fellow green mps paul manly and leader elizabeth may, atwin's election created the largest green caucus ever at three.[14]
&gt; 
&gt; in april 2021, atwin introduced her first private members’ bill, bill c-285, which would impose a nationwide ban on the use of glyphosate on forests and fields across canada stating that the use of glyphosate is a menace to human health, and plant and wildlife diversity.[15]
&gt; 
&gt; in may 2021, in response to the 2021 israel–palestine crisis, atwin condemned israeli airstrikes in the gaza strip and called israel's control of the area apartheid. atwin also called out green party leader annamie paul's statement on the conflict calling for de-escalation and more dialogue as \"totally inadequate\". in response, annamie paul's senior advisor noah zatzman blasted atwin and fellow green mp paul manly in a may 14 facebook post, calling their statements regarding the 2021 israel–palestine crisis \"appalling\" and anti-semitic, and saying \"we will work to defeat you.\"[16] this followed a statement published on the party website that quoted paul regarding the 2021 israel–palestine crisis,[17] which atwin responded to with a statement that both reiterated support for the official party policy[18] on the israeli–palestinian conflict of expecting mps to oppose the siege of gaza and illegal settlements, and described the statement quoting paul as \"totally inadequate\".[19]
&gt; 
&gt; atwin subsequently crossed the floor and joined the liberal party on june 10, citing lack of support from paul's leadership after zatzman's threat.[20] paul disagreed with this account and claimed the events had nothing to do with zatzman or her;[21] however, the remaining green mps, elizabeth may and paul manly, issued a statement stating \"unfortunately, the attack against ms. atwin by the green party leader's chief spokesperson on may 14th created the conditions that led to this crisis.\"[22] on june 14, 2021, shortly after joining the liberal caucus, atwin apologized for her earlier remarks, saying that she \"regrets her choice of words\" and adding: \"palestinians are suffering. israelis are also suffering as well as their loved ones in canada and around the world.\"[23][24][25]",liberals

&gt;what's really going to do o'toole in, is that he comes off as a leader who can't control his party.

lothe as i am to agree with you, this is largely true. it's not the only thing that's a problem, but it's a very big thing. the public does not want a party that's actually inclusive, they want a party that has a clear message that says what they want to hear and that's impossible with a bunch of idiots running around saying whatever they feel like publically. 

and no - the membership isn't voting against climate change ffs. they voted against a resolution that would have required crack downs on the oil industry and it's being taken as 'voting against climate change'. we can at least be honest here. 

but - you are correct that that resolution as it stood should never have made it to the floor. and everyone out there is going to say it's  a vote against climate change regardless of the truth. so he should have nipped that in the bud. 

&gt;but it does make it look like he actually runs things.

truth. as you say - shitty, but it's what wins. harper walked a slightly different line in that anyone could say anything in caucus and he would genuinely listen - but he crushed those who spoke out after the decisions were made on policy. and that's what you have to do.",conservatives

your best case scenario is only a best case scenario if you believe the only point of a political party is to win regardless of policy. there is simply no need for a third centrist, neoliberal party when we already have two. voters realized dexter's ndp were just more of the same, and punished him emphatically for it.

you brought up moving to renewable energy, something that is not actionable by the feds and a non-issue in all but 2 provinces—the most conservative provinces.

i’m not sure you understand how the carbon pricing program works either. 10% of the revenues go to direct green investments (like the smart cities challenge which is supporting cities to build circular low carbon economies). the rest of that money is paid out in rebates to canadians. unless you are in the top 20% of income earners you either are net even or make money from the program. and most of the people in the top 20% aren’t more than a couple hundred dollars net negative over the course of a year at worst.

if you’re actually curious about the liberal’s climate change plan you can go read the pan-canada framework. it explains what the federal government will do and what federal-provincial partnerships it is leading in regards to climate. it includes thing like home retrofitting, incentives for electric vehicles and the already mentioned municipal green economy investments.",conservatives

but currently, it is conservative governments(alberta, ontario, saskatchewan, new brunswick) that have signed a pact to help further smrs and have decided to lead on this issue. i don't think that if another party came to power in any of these provinces, that they'll suddenly become anti-nuclear and cancel the investments. 

my main point is that federally, the liberals are lacking when it comes to nuclear supports despite people like mcguinty pushing for it provincially.",liberals

the natural antibody response may have developed more methods of targeting other proteins within the virus, meaning even if the virus has changed it's more likely to find something it recognizes. same with other types of vaccinations that use a different method of introducing the virus to the body. if it was more comprehensive it might turn out to be better now vs the mrnas. despite the mrna types being better before.

also more to the point of the article, i have a feeling that the ridings that went conservative in quebec also have voters that favor bill 21, which is probably why o'toole is trying to suppress criticism of it. seems like he's losing control over his party more and more.",conservatives

(empty home tax had better impact on housing than fbt) how would a 20% tax help? the pandemic made it impossible for foreigners to buy property, but prices shot up. so how would 20% tax on foreigners help?

the answers lies in

1. how cities zone, approve development and how cumbersome that process is. an average permit in vancouver takes about 3 years (18 months if it's perfect). 

2. there's zero transparency in presale. before presales are publicly announced, spots are already purchased either by corporate entities or real estate agents.

3. it is a very painful exercise to upzone a plot to medium density (3-4 floors multi family units) residential. that kind of zoning is an exception rather than the norm. it's even more impossible to build on an empty plot of land.

4. community improvement agreement negotiations takes ages. nothing moves until council gets all the cakes it wants to eat. eg: burnaby stalled parts of brentwood redevelopment over types of trees that should be planted.

5. low interest rates, stress test and collateral. this is all requirements stacked against first time buyers.

6. lack of disincentives against hoarding property. how the heck is it possible for a single homeowner, own a single family home and 2 apartments and be able to apply for mortgage on a 3rd apartment?

7. absolutely piss poor voter participation in city council elections. a mere 1k votes in a city of 250k, gets you a council seat. and we expect housing to be a priority. 🤦‍♂️

so someone please explain, how does foreign buyers tax help bring property prices down especially given the cause of all this is local? i don't see anybody even bring this up. so why shouldn't i take this as nothing more than dog whistling?

granted this is in bc. but i'm sure there are similar stories in the rest of canada.

edit: added point no. 7. edits for grammar, spelling, tone.

edit #2: i was asking a rhetorical question. i know foreign buyers tax or a ban is useless without tackling local issues first.",liberals

as some have pointed out, the pm is at home. even the [sun](https://torontosun.com/news/national/where-in-the-world-is-justin-trudeau) says this, since you complain of \"liberal media\". perhaps he's avoiding \"plastering his face all over the media\" because he wants privacy with his family. or he's decided to do it less after people complained incessantly (and rightly at times too) about how much he loved cameras. which would be a good thing imo and i appreciate the personal growth if that's the reason.

why is it so difficult to admit that all politicians who travel abroad shouldn't be doing so regardless of their party? you do the tories no favours by refusing to acknowledge this. i'm a pretty left leaning person but i can confidently say that i wouldn't approve of an ndp, green, or liberal mp travelling abroad either.",liberals

here's what went down on election night: the liberal party lost 0.5 percentage points in popular vote nationwide, and for losing that share they gained 5 seats. the ndp gained 1.8 percentage points of voting share, and for having gained more than any other major party this election in vote shares was rewarded only a single seat.

so that's what we have - the ndp winning 18% of the vote and being rewarded 7.4% of the seats in parliament, whereas the liberals - *once again -* failed to earn the most votes for the second election in a row, decreased their share of support among the public, and walked away with five more seats than they had before, sitting a mere 10 seats away from majority territory.

i don't want to hear any more journalists saying \"the ndp didn't break through\", sorta hard to run these races when the system has crippled everyone but the liberals (who historically have always walked away with more seats than votes) before the race even begins. and that's not to say i wasn't myself disappointed with the campaign this year, but to pretend like they didn't \"break through\" because it wasn't reflected in their seat wins is indicative more of an issue with the system of elections itself and not the ndp.",liberals

ok. let’s talk numbers. u/canadian_infidel says spending was the highest it’s ever been since wwii, and they’re right. 

what he’s not saying is that it’s in line with other major industrialized nations around the world. last year, the united states federal deficit was roughly $3.3 trillion usd, or  $4.057 trillion cad. their gdp is about $21.43 trillion usd, or $26.346 trillion cad. that makes their covid deficit about 15.3% of gdp. their total accumulated debt is now about ~129% debt to gdp. 

how did canada do? our $314 billion cad 2020 deficit on a $2.134 trillion cad gdp puts us at 14.7% of gdp, or **lower** than that of the united states.  ok… what about our total debt? ~117% debt to gdp, which is again, still **lower** than the united states. 

is this desirable? hell no. obviously not. keep in mind… this 2020 debt (in the us) was passed by a **republican** senate and a **republican** president. so many people have no desire to look at the actual numbers and use real world comparators… because “hur dur trudeau bad.” i don’t like trudeau, and i did not vote for him last election, and i will not vote for him in the future; but i refuse to parrot ignorant talking points without putting them in the proper context. 

you know who ran the single largest deficit in canadian history pre-covid? stephen harper. who, by the way, is a god damn economist by trade. government spending by nations who control their own stable currencies isn’t the same as someone’s personal budget; but it makes great optics for someone who’s just trying to score cheap political points, without offering concrete alternative solutions themselves. modern monetary theory is complex.

catholics don't wear religious symbols, though.

i keep seeing this argument, but i really struggle to follow it. if quebec wanted to reign in the abuses of the catholic church, there's any number of things it could do to prevent prosthelytizing at work, to give victims restitution, or to protect children.

instead, there's a law that's so aggressive that it's only in force by suspending the constitution and ignoring quebec's own *charter.* 

it restricts headscarves, yarmulkes, kippahs, bindis, but doesn't do a thing to catholics. that sure seems like cutting them a break.
