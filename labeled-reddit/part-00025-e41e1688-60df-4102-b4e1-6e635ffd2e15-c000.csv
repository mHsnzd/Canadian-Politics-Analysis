there was nothing effective about it in bringing attention to québec's racism in québec. 

on one hand, english canadians are now comfortably flattered of how much more civilized they are, a sentiment so evidently put in your third paragraph and in of attaran's last tweet where he claims québec is unique in it's racism, and a sentiment shared by english canadians for centuries. it's not a new thing, and it's not something english canadians seem to want to fight. 

on the other hand, it only distracted québécois from their own racism problems to witness another proof of how francophobia is still so much popular in a country that always touts its progressiveness (while still massively voting for the conservatives). 

québec has huge racism problems. there's not enough being done to fight against it, and its institution are problematic. but singling out québec is another xenophobic tradition used to be blind to your own problems.

i just want to mention that all those programs that the liberal party introduced only came at the very end of their reign. before that they were stanchly centrist if not centre right.

for example under mcguinty the liberals implemented these right wing policies:

* cut corporate taxes
* froze the minimum wage
* delisted eye care from ohip
* privatized parts of the hydro system
* continued the privatization of the harris era (air ambulance, drivetest, mto road maintenance, etc.)
* cut spending significantly after the recession to control spending (for example they wanted to gut tvo's budget by 50%)
* continued underfunding the mto and the healthcare system
* allowed tuition rates to get out of control

their more left wing policies were:

* increased public school funding
* something else here i'm sure

wynne was a major departure from this since she instituted a bunch of left wing policies that you mentioned but only right before the election to suck up ndp votes. i fully expect the lpo under del duca to return to the mcguinty era.",liberals

the funny thing is conservatives will be angry at o’toole for 

1) going forward with a carbon tax the party faithful has been repeatedly told is the harbinger of the antichrist, and 

2) angry they won’t be able to directly spend their rebates (which one would assume a lower c conservatives should be for, less bureaucracy, less government, more focus on people, etc). they will fail to see that o’toole is desperately trying to reroute that cash into industries cpc base voters love, and instead blow a gasket and get even more furious at having elected him as a”true blue” leader. 

just a series of ridiculous missteps by o’toole, but completely understandable and frankly perhaps unavoidable. when you’re trying to please the social conservative base and trying to win over the majority of canadians who believe climate change is real, you end up in this weird zone of contradictory policy ideas. (lol a carbon tax which is less expensive so less effective while not giving the money back to the people at the same time in order to reroute the funds for a private company to direct. isn’t kenney trying to do something like that with alberta’s pension?)

harper never attempted to hit his targets, so i can't see how this is useful.

&gt;not to mention that we are 4th last on climate target progress under the liberals.

can you explain why you like the ccpi's method of comparison? \"target progress\" seems like a poor way to describe a score that is:

- ghg emissions (40% of overall score)
- renewable energy (20% of overall score)
- energy use (20% of overall score)
- climate policy (20% of overall score)

it's more a matter of current status - they put us at rank 22 for emissions per capita *trend*, but give us the worst score over our current emissions. the trend metric may actually put us at 19th, actually (given how the organization likes to leave ranks 1-3 empty as a form of protest).

or, regarding renewables:

&gt;the renewable energies grew also only by 4% within 5 years. this comparable low growth rate is rated very low, contributing to a very low rating in the renewable energy category.

their explanation for canada's score here is a bit odd, as well. this is a real mix of \"current status\" and \"growth/progress\", and canada gains a well above-average amount of its energy from renewable sources. how does this justify a \"very low\" score for renewables? are you siding with their attack on...talking about nuclear energy?

&gt;experts also cite a troubling recent emphasis on supporting “small” modular nuclear reactors, and potentially even an interest in considering nuclear as a green source of supply.",liberals

after all the may gaffes and poor campaign, nb and pei still voted respectively 17% and 21% for the greens in 2019. if, as i expect, paul performs better on the stage, these numbers will, at minimum, remain stable. and this time atwin has the incumbency advantage and a raised profile nationally. you can bet that not only the federal greens, but also the nb greens &amp; david coon especially will campaign hard for her.

that no anglo leaders have succeeded afterwards is a reflection of a poor québec strategy / knowledge, inadequate french, and in the case of conservatives, having a \"we'll force a pipeline on you\" message and blatant social conservatism.

gxb40d9,2021-05-07T05:23:47.000-07:00,"$100 million in federal funding for cleanup of alberta oil and gas wells went to sites licensed to cnrl | the narwhal project was a good one - to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells.

why did one cent of taxpayers money go into the pockets of these large oil companies, companies that paid dividends to their shareholders?  the way i see it,  all canadians have the right to be upset about how jason kenney and his government managed the program.  

from the article

&gt;hundreds  of millions of dollars in federal funding allocated to clean up oil and  gas well sites in alberta has gone toward cleaning up sites owned by some of canada’s largest oil and gas companies, data shows.  
&gt;  
&gt;in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic, prime minister justin trudeau announced [$1.7 billion in federal funding](https://thenarwhal.ca/11-things-trudeau-1-7-billion-clean-up-festering-orphan-inactive-wells/)  to help with the sealing and cleaning up of orphan and inactive oil and  gas wells across b.c. and the prairies — on the heels of intense [industry lobbying efforts](https://thenarwhal.ca/capp-oilsands-trudeau-coronavirus-climate-change-response/).  
&gt;  
&gt;“our goal  is to create immediate jobs in these provinces while helping companies  avoid bankruptcy and supporting our environmental targets,” trudeau  said.  
&gt;  
&gt;alberta received the bulk of the funding, to the tune of [$1 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-wells-remediation-money-ottawa-alberta-1.5543935). the province began rolling out those funds last year — through an initiative it dubbed the site rehabilitation program —  to contractors with plans to clean up oil and gas sites licensed to companies that had ostensibly been struggling to pay to clean them up  themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;but an  analysis of publicly available data for two granting periods — which  together allocated more than $400 million in federal funds — shows the  lion’s share of alberta’s federal funding in those periods was used to  clean up sites owned by some of the country’s largest oil and gas  companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;half of  the more than $400 million went to sites held by eight companies —  including canadian natural resources limited (cnrl), cenovus, husky oil  operations limited, imperial oil resources limited and torxen (which  acquired [$1.3 billion in assets from cenovus](https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/cenovus-selling-palliser-assets-in-alberta-to-torxen-for-1-3-billion) in 2017 and is headed by a [former cenovus executive](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/streetwise/cenovus-nears-sale-of-alberta-natural-gas-assets-to-pay-debt/article36293650/)). the remaining half was  divided between sites held by 275 other companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;contracts for work on sites held by cnrl, a company that has reported an average of [$1.9 billion in annual net profits](https://www.cnrl.com/upload/report/134/04/2020-annual-report---teams.pdf#page=112)  over the last 10 years, were allocated more than $102 million in  funding in the two grant periods. like many in the industry, the company  struggled in 2020, reporting a net loss of $435 million, though these  were less than the losses it faced during the 2015 oil price crash.  despite its losses in 2020, the company’s shareholder dividends were  increased by 11 per cent in march, which the company boasted marked the  “21st consecutive year of dividend increases.”

that said you also have to figure out what help trudeau can offer.  he could send more vaccines but then he has to explain to manitobans or people in rural quebec why albertans are more important then they are.  kenney could also redirect vaccines to hotspots but he knows it is not a winning play (which is why he did ask trudeau for it)

trudeau can supply manpower but albertan clinics are running and it isn't a manpower shortage that is limiting.  the other place that uses lots of people is contact tracing...and i'm going to assume that is currently not working and manpower won't fix it.

he could bring them in for enforcement but the feds don't really have a standing police force kicking around...they have an army but i'm remembering there have been many many failers in history for using an army on their own people (and the differences in training is massive).

i've been a canadian just long enough to have noticed a pattern when comparing canada to the usa, and the pattern is 10%.  or call it one tenth if you want, or maybe use the decimal thing since it's more metric.  but 10% is the general rule of thumb, and i've got (sort of) numbers to back it up.

canada's population is roughly 1/10 the size of america's population.  we also have (per capita) about 1/10 of their poverty, and 1/10 of their violent crime rate.  the average canadian movie or tv production is 1/10 as good as most stuff made in the usa.  there are other examples, but you get the idea.

and when it comes to our politics, we're 10% as crazy as the yanks are.  our idea of a major campaign event is a speech with a few hundred people attending, maybe a quick video on a screen, and that's it.  in the usa, no campaign event is complete without a live concert, a packed stadium and a fireworks display that would level any small city.  our main political parties stay as close to the centre as they possibly can, their political parties are drawing thick lines and asking voters to pick a side and fight like hell.",conservatives

well at least we have acknowledgement that parliament, as a branch of government is part of the government. however, the context is not \"the liberal party of canada has formed government\", but rather the government of canada has signed a contract. that contract is not immediately dissolved if next week we have an election and someone else is prime minister. the government of the day is the one that negotiates the contracts, but they sign for the government. the obligations in the contract are on the government of canada writ large, not this particular government.

in any standard contract with a confidentiality clause, not only the contracting parties make it available to people within their organization (e.g. an opposition leader), but they can make it available to third parties. some common examples of a third party who might be joined into a confidentiality clause might be your lawyers, your accountants, an engineering company, in fact for certain elements of contracts they might make specific information *exclusively* available to a third party if the underlying information needs to be protected from the other side of the contract but is also required to make it work. 

this is all normal practice between companies, and while every private sector company is intensely aware that contracting with the government is different i have never in any of my years reading confidentiality agreements seen one which says \"you can share it with your ceo, cfo, cio, board, everyone throughout all of the levels of your organization who might need it, but not the coo who might be the head guy next year, that guys a jerk\". its too particular, and while you can theoretically contract to almost anything there are a few items which are questionable:

1. the prime minister likely does not have authority to execute a contract to explicitly block parliamentary review or to constrain the current or future parliaments from reviewing a contract his cabinet signed.
2. if anyone put a clause like that into the contract, it is unlikely to have been pfizer, corporate legal teams tend not to like to put in new untested clauses, and companies have to work with all major parties.
3. in order to simply function the government of canada is going to have to be able to include people into the confidentiality agreement, some of whom will be quite junior.
4. the text of the confidentiality clause is generally not, in itself, confidential material, and if it says everything that the government says it does, they should be able to release that excerpt without too much difficulty.",liberals

the only reasonable approach for the nl election is that it should have just been called off entirely and called again at a later date when it can be more fairly run.  it sounds like it's the premier and lt-gov foote (who is effectively a partisan extension of the liberals) that are vetoing that happening, because they are at 65% in the polls and want to force this through before they can drop support.",liberals

yes, you’re partially correct, and you’re also giving your soapboxing friend a pass for not reading an article but instead taking the opportunity to lecture canadians about a different gun issue.  that’s divisive but perhaps unintentional.


trudeau straight up lied in the house of commons to gain support for this law. he said \"gun owners didn't have to show their license to buy a gun, they weren't bound by law\" which is utterly false and frankly hurt to hear the pm make a bold face lie like that to canadians about gun owners and the law that we take so seriously. c71 is not \"perfectly reasonable\". its also an attempt at a back door long gun registry. 

“i'm in the boards all the time and i have never seen a gun owner call someone \"sheep\". we are correct however in calling out peoples ignorance in regards to firearm law ...”

well, here i am, telling you i’ve been insulted multiple times in discussion on this subject. it’s naive of you to deny this is happening. i have no issue with discussion or people who try to educate others. it’s obvious that’s not what i’m referring to.

“you complain that this is about some “schadenfrude towards the rural conservative other”

thats because it is. people living in the city simply don't own as many guns as rural canadians do. in the city, owning guns kind of sucks considering all the law you're required to follow and the only place you can shoot thats within a reasonable drive is an indoor range.”

it being inconvenient to be an urban gun owner is very different from this idea that there is a “shadenfrude towards the rural conservative other” ... the reality is that urban voters either don’t care or have been turned off by the behaviour of gun advocates.  i don’t see how painting urban populations as having a disdain for rural communities is going to sway urban voters. that, my friend, is a divisive approach to this issue and it’s right out of the nra playbook.  works well to engage gun owners themselves but turns off everyone else.",liberals

gnrwsqe,2021-02-16T23:52:39.000-08:00,"senior liberal mp urges trudeau cabinet to ‘wake up and smell the roses’ on china there is not a lot of accuracy in what you said about easter.

in fact, easter is not anymore independent than any other liberal mp.

easter has done this many times before on issues like we and getting all information out at one time and even on issues like carbon taxation so easter has a tendency to be frantic and opine on issues and he does it as a way to get ahead of issues.

i think that is the approach he is taking, so looking out for the liberal party.

as for nserc yes it is arms length and independent and the selection of the private organizations and groups are done by the universities. that was confirmed by the spokesperson for champagne's department and champagne in qp said to that edmonton conservative that he should know how the process works being a veteran mp. it is arms length and done solely by that and he also said that the process back in september was subject to change based on a new framework and warnings were given by the department to the universities to think about security issues.

as for gac and aiib and champagne, i guess you forget that freeland ran gac prior to champagne and the determinations were made in 2017-18 by her and her department. the mortgages have nothing to do with that. that is just attacking champagne for basically nothing other than saying look over there.

aiib and funding if you look back was funded because canada wanted to be part of a group to fund development in central asian countries and countries like australia and argentina and numerous others were part of it. i am not sure if others left since then but canada is definitely in it for a long haul.

i argue also whether easter is accurate to say it is an arm of the ccp as that has not been determined at this moment. some may say it is but not enough determination has been given yet to prove that. easter may just be going on a limb on that front. but nserc is independent. so, going back to both issues, the government is unlikely to change as they have given their reasons on nserc and aiib is firmly for the reasons i outlined.

as for csis, the government does make decisions on national security but again aiib at the time was still fine and nserc has been happening going back to the late 2000s and all that has changed is more warnings but the government is changing the process on nserc. it will lead to change.

as for whether the pmo listens, the article does not offer much in the way of facts. i saw it regarding aiib. all it really mentions is we need to leave because it might be an arm of china? what about the other western countries part of it? not much said there in the article which will lead to change. as for nserc that is given already by champagne. so all and all it might be embarrassing but easter won't lead to change as his frantic behavior is common and known in liberal circles. at most, the government may have to answer one or two questions but aiib and the previous arguments going back to 2017-18 will be given.",liberals

&amp;hellip; to pay for the costs of the pandemic.  be careful here about the phrasing.  i _absolutely agree_ that a wealth tax would be more popular as a pay-for than a broad tax increase, but i predict that the lpc will not be so stupid as to introduce the latter.

if the question is a wealth tax versus nothing, i think the latter wins.  it's a matter of diffuse benefits versus concentrated (and politically connected) costs.  if the ndp wants to push a wealth tax policy, then in my opinion the best way to campaign on it would be to frame it as a reshuffling of tax costs: raise a wealth tax and lower the gst.

&gt;  and believe inequality is a major problem. 

which unfortunately does not have a direct policy prescription.  there's no side-effect-free \"inequality\" knob for the government to turn.  and when you get down to the details, canadians tend to be happy with at least some aspects of that inequality; nobody would dare tax home equity on a current basis for example.

&gt; it actually pretty clear to me that the liberal base actually wants these kind of social democratic policies that the liberals are not going to deliver.

i don't think this is yet proven.  you can obviously point to slow/non-implementation of previous campaign promises like electoral reform or pharmacare as evidence that the liberal party is not in fact progressive, but since these facts are plain as day then why is a progressive youth wing still enthusiastic about the party?

&gt; the biggest problem for the ndp is that the liberals sound progressive and that's enough for most canadians.

i think maybe that is in fact enough for most canadians &amp;ndash; progressive policies are an admirable goal, but a slow and measured implementation may be enough.  this is more consistent with the political costs associated with implementation, where people really do have to concern themselves with the pay-fors, provincial negotiations, and limits of any implementation. 

as a more concrete example, look at pharmacare.  this is a net-good policy, but implementing it in a budget-neutral way requires white-collar-employed people to give up existing prescription coverage and pay a tax instead.  that shift of costs from the private to public side of the ledger is _visible_, which can easily make it unpopular.

this is also how quebec's public prescription coverage works.  ramq has a (low) baseline benefit and works acceptably as prescription insurance for the poor, elderly, and those facing catastrophic costs, but the [annual premium](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en/citizens/prescription-drug-insurance/annual-premium) (currently $662/person/yr above an income threshold) is not cheap, and it's entirely avoided by those who receive an equivalent-or-better employee plan.",liberals

however, i think they will drop some in the coming weeks. this third wave is a pretty big kick in the teeth even with optimism about vaccines. 

that could start turning around if cases start dropping in a few weeks and vaccines get up to the 40% or so with one shot range. but i can see them slipping until at least then.

edit: yea, a little slippage in most recent nanos as well. down to an 8/9 pt spread rather than the 12 or so it was before. nanos is a rolling average (i think with new data added to old) so i tend to look at it for trends rather than anything else. 

i think this third wave is a pretty easy moment for the general public to finally lose patience with waiting for normalcy and impose some political consequences. it’s ironic because honestly, the third wave being so bad is mostly on the provinces imo but life isn’t fair.

the good thing for the liberals is that they will be able to wait until the vaccines start kicking in, the economy picks up and it’s summer before they even have to think about calling an election. i doubt the opposition would try to force one.

okay, do you have a shred of evidence to back that up?

&gt;… to pay for the costs of the pandemic.  be careful here about the phrasing.

[a strong majority of canadians supported a wealth tax in 2019 too.](https://i.imgur.com/exuuzqb.png)

&gt;nobody would dare tax home equity on a current basis for example.

i might be confused by what you mean here, but isn't this just property tax?

&gt;i don't think this is yet proven.  you can obviously point to  slow/non-implementation of previous campaign promises like electoral  reform or pharmacare as evidence that the liberal party is not in fact  progressive, but since these facts are plain as day then why is a  progressive youth wing still enthusiastic about the party?

i think we can take people at their word that they want the things they say they want. the question of why people say they want these things and then support a party that doesn't deliver them is a good one. i don't have any hard evidence here, but when i talk to liberal voters i know, the number one motivation seems to be avoiding a conservative government. the second factor is that most people simply don't track policy that closely and think that the liberal government is just doing a lot more than it really is. how much longer this can hold up is an interesting question. six years in, i've certainly noticed an increase in skepticism driven by the lack of progress on files like childcare, pharmacare and housing. these are areas where soaring liberal rhetoric really fails to match realities. the final thing i'll say is that american politics has really infected us. i don't know of a good way to measure this, but i do suspect that canadians regard politics in a more polarized and less nuanced way than they used to.

&gt;as a more concrete example, look at pharmacare.  this is a net-good  policy, but implementing it in a budget-neutral way requires  white-collar-employed people to give up existing prescription coverage  and pay a tax instead.  that shift of costs from the private to public  side of the ledger is *visible*, which can easily make it unpopular.

is it really though? the government could implement universal pharmacare, implement an employer-side payroll tax of roughly equal cost and regular people would barely know the difference. i know the idea that 'taxes are unpopular' is practically canon in liberal circles, but the foundation of this belief seems incredibly shakey.",liberals

you’ve also ignored the fact that interest rates are historically low right. it’s not like they were running deficits and only getting meagre growth in the economy. it was a literal arbitrage opportunity that left us in a better dept position than we were before. yes they won’t stay low for ever and this is known fact. but it’s also unlikely for them to jump dramatically soon. and the reality is much of the debt that has been rolling over, or will be in the next few years, originally had higher interest rates than today, resulting in reduced debt servicing costs. in fact our debt service ratio is expected to hit its lowest recorded level by 2023-24, despite the enormous fiscal stimulus from the pandemic.

the pbo in late 2018 actually stated that the government’s fiscal position was sustainable over the long term in their fiscal sustainability report 2018. so not sure where you’re getting that they said the opposite for that period of time.

i think the fact you’re blaming the sale of the 407 on pet instead of the short-sighted ideological decision making of harris’ government of the time makes it pretty hard to take your broader argument seriously

i don’t think it’s wrong to challenge fiscal policy, but it’s important to have a full understanding of the situation. we can’t keep using outdated economic theory to criticize policy. i do think that fiscal anchors are needed to guide policy post pandemic, and i would like to see an increase in revenues to support some programs like universal dental care or pharma care",liberals

the debate on this topic, contrary to your own rhetoric, is largely closed. most people who are educated on the topic agree that proportional representation is the only sensible class of electoral systems to use and from there it is just implementation details. there are plenty of countries that have already gone through this fiasco of switching electoral systems, so there's no need to pretend we're treading on new ground or anything.

you'll also find that advocates generally rally behind proportional representation and it is establishment interests that are keen on spreading doubt, misinformation, and specifically ranked choice voting because it would appear as a (false) compromise to laymen without actually addressing the problem of how terribly represented the canadian electorate is. we went through a similar process provincially in bc, too.",liberals

&gt;and what motive does prof geist have to misrepresent what happened in the committee? he is an academic, not a politician.

geist might be an academic, but that doesn't mean he's free from biases or certain ideological slants. he has opposed the bill, as well as the other bills or attempts to address growing problems of hate speech (etc) on whole, because it seems that in his mind, any regulation is too much regulation when it comes to the internet. 

i'm only pointing out here that geist *appears* to be misrepresenting what is happening, just as he, in a saturday post, misrepresented what had occurred at the friday meeting. i watched more or less the full meeting and wrote up a rough, general summary [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onguardforthee/comments/n3akzf/liberals_and_ndp_block_debate_on_updated_charter/gwpf10q/). fair from blocking debate, the debate continued for most of the run time of the meeting until it was requested to adjourn the discussion to move on with the work before them. the debate was then resumed today, and the motion harder presented was amended by unanimous agreement by the committee (unless i'm forgetting a negative), to include the ndp's representative's amendment stipulating a specific time frame. an additional amendment is being discussed, proposed by one of the lpc members, to make additional changes to the motion (the biggest of which is to remove the sub amendment, part c, about suspending the clause-by-clause evaluation of the bill.) they unfortunately ran out of time and will continue the discussion on friday at the next scheduled meeting.",liberals
