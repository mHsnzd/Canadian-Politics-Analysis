&gt;\"there were no allegations. i heard a rumour that i wanted investigated. … i wanted an inappropriate relationship that i heard a rumour about to be investigated,\" he said.

&gt;novak testified he subsequently asked then-national security adviser richard fadden to investigate the matter, and the conservatives were prepared to cancel his appointment if the military police and fadden probes turned up any wrongdoing.

&gt;but the department of national defence confirmed on thursday that military police only recommended closing their investigation on july 17, 2015 — the same day that vance was officially sworn in as defence chief during an elaborate ceremony in ottawa.

glad we have the canadian press spelling it out more bluntly than the globe's article. obviously people get tired when this government blames things on the previous one, but in this case o'toole's involvement completely shatters any moral highground the tories have on this.

o'toole and the rest of harper's cabinet knew that vance was problematic, and now we know that didn't deter them for appointing him. best case scenario for the tories is that they did not care to find out. worst case is that they more or less kavanaughed him in.",conservatives

however, it doesn't fully excuse the ineffective policies that he has implemented to date, many of which made the problem worse (i.e. making it easier to pay more for a house, rather than bringing the price of houses down). it's obvious why this was done - more people own houses than not, and they want their houses to go up in value. however, i think there's a broad unease with how difficult it is to move at the moment. even seniors are concerned with how little room there is to cash out and move somewhere cheaper.

the elephant in the room is interest rates and monetary policy. trudeau has said he doesn't want to talk about the latter in this election cycle, which should be a red flag. he's not in charge of the bank of canada, but he does give them their mandate and it is up for renewal after the election. those factors together suggest that he does not actually want to take meaningful action, but that he doesn't want you to find that out until after the election.

many evaluations of the problem call out interest rates, but it's not an equal partner in a bullet list of factors - it is the biggest issue. we can print money a lot faster than we can build houses.

the reason that housing is becoming an intractable problem is that elevated housing prices have been allowed to persist for too long. we are now in a position where anything done to bring house prices down to a level considered affordable would hurt a large number of constituents - not only homeowners but also financial institutions and the mortgage insurers - that are invested in house prices staying elevated. you could even say that the economy depends on it.

so, to me, that's the context for why he keeps on with these demand-side policies. they do not want house prices to come down, and when they talk about \"affordability\" it is mostly about keeping prices elevated while allowing people to afford the debt required to pay those prices. a lot of people will continue to never make the cut.

i'm not sure any party will solve this, because as soon as they try they will be pulled aside and warned of the consequences. it's one of those things that needs to hit a wall of some kind so that politicians are forced to act, rather than being seen to act of their own free will. which comes back to monetary policy...

here's a thought: stop calling the stress test a \"stress test\", as if you are actually worried about 6% mortgage rates any time soon. reframe it as a state-sponsored capital control on the cost of capital to borrow for housing. it will bring house prices down and you have control over by how much. and, sure, it'll cost more to service a mortgage, but... your downpayment will go a lot further and it'll take you less time to save it.",liberals

haap0nu,2021-08-25T00:32:14.000-07:00,"the poll thread - wednesday, august 25, 2021 the tax credit is super low and will not really impact much (it’s like 750$ after taxes). it is very much not the reason i prefer the liberal plan.

you are correct that they will only build about 150k new builds. but, making sure that disrepaired houses re-enter the market is still an increase in supply. nevertheless, the 1.4m homes is not why i prefer the liberal plan.

one of the most significant contributors to the housing squeeze is nymbyism at the municipal level. by preventing new builds - and particularly high density builds - nymby’s artificially restrict the supply of housing in their area, which leads to: urban sprawl, and a reduced supply of housing. 

of the plans i have seen, the liberals are the only party who has put forward a plan to try and tackle this debacle. by tying municipal funding to these projects, they give municipal governments the incentive (through carrot and stick) to fight against nymbyism and make sure these projects get done, thereby increasing supply and overcoming one of the major contributors to the housing crisis. many larger municipalities depend on federal funds. it’s a lot like their carrot and stick model with the provinces for carbon taxation or childcare - we know in these settings it can be effective.

i am also a massive proponent of rent to own and the decrease in mortgage insurance - people who want to own their own homes are often cut out of this market because of the high entry cost of a downpayment. mortgage insurance preys on this - and a 25% reduction would help people struggling to own and start a family. rent to own similarly is a fantastic concept where renters effectively accumulate a downpayment on a property. i know several friends from england who came to own their homes this way when they otherwise would never have been able to.

the tax against housing flippers is a welcome change - they artificially restrict the supply of start homes by upgrading them to mcmansions and really drive upward momentum in the market.

i don’t much care for the foreign ownership taxes or bans, as i do not believe they will have a large effect (they did help somewhat in bc originally so it can help a bit at least).

as for the housing bill of rights it’s a nice buzzword but i don’t know how enforceable it will be. i do want to see the full proposal there. it does seem like they are going to empower authorities to better go after money laundering which is a contributor to housing speculation as well. but again, not a major consideration.

finally, i appreciate the increased vacancy tax, tax credits to home owners to create a second unit, which may help stimulate increased renting supply, and the banning of blind bidding (which definitely promotes unsustainable price increases - everyone is bidding 100k+ because they don’t know what others are bidding. this should help bring prices back down to reality and stop speculation).

it’s not a perfect plan and i would really love someone to input a scaling buyers tax at purchase and a scaling land value tax per year for every additional property after the primary living residence. the ndp however did not offer that either.

to conclude, i do believe the government needs to build/help ensure supply. but i do not believe that that will solve the housing crisis on its own. the housing crisis is now a multifaceted problem stemming from municipal levels all the way to the federal government, and the liberal plan has the most multifaceted approach thus far to tackle the issue. i hope this helps describe where i’m coming from.",liberals

compared to your political preferences, sure.

compared to past canadian governments, or governments of other countries with large oil reserves?  not so much.

&gt;and the stuff about environmental assessments, emissions caps, etc., is basically just a fig-leaf.

trans mountain is hugely consequential in your view, but changes to the environmental assessment process (which contributed to the cancellation of energy east, a pipeline project with 2x the capacity of trans mountain), is dismissed as a fig-leaf.  not sure that adds up.

and we'll have to wait and see the details, but the emissions cap could be pretty significant.

&gt;expanding fossil fuel infrastructure in the midst of an ongoing climate crisis... is actually a pretty extreme position.

that's one way to look at it, and i do see where you're coming from.  but ultimately new infrastructure is being built because demand exists, and that oil is moving with or without a new pipeline (oil goes by train, when there's not enough pipeline capacity).

long term, the key is reducing the demand for oil, by using less and switching to alternative technologies.

&gt;in direct opposition to a \"reconciliation\" program

many indigenous groups support trans mountain pipeline, while others oppose it.  can't please everyone, but the government consulted with those affected, and made changes to the project to accommodate those with concerns.

&gt;it's just that we can't always see that, because most of us have been living in an oil-dominated state all our lives.

we live in a world (and a country) where \\~99% of cars and almost 100% of trucks, boats and airplanes still run on oil.  with new technologies emerging, that will change over time, but until then, oil remains in high demand and countries with oil will continue to produce it (and sell to those who don't have any).

in the meantime, the key is accelerating that transition away from oil, and requiring the industry to reduce its own emissions and use cleaner processes/technologies.",liberals

i know this is a common way of framing democracy, but i don't really think anyone actually believes that is how it works if you take a moment to think about it. no offense, but nothing in this world is perfect. every day you make choices that are suboptimal. 

furthermore, that's an excuse for most people who really are just apathetic. every evidence i've seen indicates that \"people failing to inform themselves\" is a far bigger proportion of voters than \"informed people objecting on principle\".

and that is important because who do you think you're teaching a lesson to by failing to vote? it isn't like the election will get cancelled. it just means that somebody else gets to decide who - among the undesirable options - runs the country. at least by voting you can choose the lesser evil.

lastly, the low political participation is a major reason *why* we have such poor choices on the ballot. how many people get involved in political parties? what kind of people are left to decide who goes on the ballot if most people aren't involved?

&gt;ultimately, \"if no candidate represents your interests\", then that just means it is more important for you to participate in the political process - not less.

...you voting for the lesser of two evils (as you put it) also isn't going insure that better options exist. arguably voting for the lesser of two evils is also responsible for us having poorer choices. at least in a system where voting is optional parties can arguably try to reach out to apathetic voters, they can try and find policies that will attract a higher voter turn out.

this is also fine and upheld by the majority of canadians and a majority of conservatives, just not a lot of social conservatives.

no matter what doug ford and the conservative government tell you.

this is less ok, but the left hand media did get themselves worked up and potrayed doug ford like some sort of evil creature that was gonna completely remove lgbt issues from the curriculum, which as far as i know he didn't do, just allowed  parents to have a little more control over what their children learnt.

either way, a teacher should be discussing the issues with the class and allowing students to have a discussion amongst themselves. which in my mind, is healthy for a young group of people still figuring out how all of this politics nonsense works. but if the teacher is pushing their own opinions there is an issue for me.

breaking up telecom monopolies is the small thinking that makes people hate the ndp. 

here's a small political truth. people never want to hear from the government unless somehow it improves their lives; and for the most part that means lowering the risk in their lives.

the government breaking things is just the constant ndp naivety that the world will be better if we smash things and spend money freely.

building the country is what makes the ndp strong. public health insurance, national childcare. these are good programs that lower the risk for the average person. the federal ndp picked up provincial public health insurance (saskatchewan) and nationalized it; and the same now with childcare (quebec).

as for the telecoms, i kinda just threw that one out there as an example. i’m not really sure it’s the answer to the problem of them bending us over a barrel, but i do like the option of creating a national entity to compete with them - sasktel in saskatchewan is a remarkable success for bringing prices down for consumers and should be emulated.

i guess this is another example of ndp ideas that rub the wrong way. a lot of people know you can't break up the telecoms and still have a viable communications grid in canada. you'd need a new architecture of a strategy, like blanket legalizing municipal fibre; however, since the federal government doesn't technically know that municipalities exist, this doesn't work either. 

a lot of ndp policies are actually provincial jurisdictions. the federal government can only invest in an existing program.

i personally agree with pharmacare by the way. i was playing a bit of a dummy with the, \"pharmacare is not pragmatic. no one knows how to do it. again, naive.\" line just to see how i'd react. i think your more pragmatic line is more in keeping with an ndp winner.

for another instance of the same idea, you could start with \"canada needs affordable, effective, immediate pharmacare. we will start by creating a public schedule of the generic drugs manufactured in canada, that the federal health transfer will fund as part of the public health insurance program in the canada health act. we will create a public fund to purchase patents to off-market drugs and license them to generic drug manufacturers. we will change the law for pharmaceuticals patents, so if your drugs are not available on the market they will have increasingly higher patent renewal fees. use it or lose it.\"

this new argument is a fallacy. if every single little country thinks like that we’re fucked. every single country on earth needs to do their part to lower their emissions and pointing fingers is going to exacerbate the problem. the issue of outsourcing pollution can be easily solved by levying a carbon intensity tax on all imports - this would benefit local sectors and raise the prices of “dirty” ghg intensive imports. the secondary effect would be that more manufacturing would be retained here, because transporting goods over long distances would mean higher carbon intensity taxes.

we can do all the things you suggested with a carbon tax, and it will be easier for some of them. except for possibly the oil - there are few refineries in canada, and more importantly, alberta in general *does not want* to sell to canada - this was the whole controversy with the original trudeau’s national energy idea. alberta prefers to sell its oil abroad either in the united states or across the pond to get higher bang for their buck. using our own oil would require 1) construction of refineries and 2) private company acceptance of earning less money then on the world market - which they aren’t going to do.

investing more and more into oil is also a fools gambit as we are approaching peak oil https://www.google.ca/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/iduskbn2870ny.

yes, it will take time to reduce from peak oil, and yes, oil will always be a part of our foreseeable future. but transportation accounts for 30% of oil usage, and even bloomberg suggests up to 50% of new vehicles sold by 2030 in the world will be fully electric - that is going to be a massive hit to demand; and thus the value of oil, and therefore expensive oils to produce, like, say, the tar sands, are going to have a baaaaad time.

i still fail to see how english canadians, citing other english canadians, analyze and justify the question, only because it suits their own biases towards québec. 

the question was horrible. it wasn't a bad question because it made french canadians mad. it wasn't bad because it lazily tied bill 21 to racism: it was bad because it was a hugely bloated or convulated question, because it used dated language and concepts, and because it conflated vastly different things together.

i've seen other english canadians answer about that and i still scratch my head. no liberal voter would have voted bq if the question was only ''bill 21 is considered discriminatory for many canadians, explain your position'', which would be a factual position, and one that would let yfb fight for his answer. and yet it happened. a lot of people against bill 21 were mad about the question, for many reasons, and yet you almost don't hear about them either. many of us in the province say that [the question was problematic for important reasons too.](https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/why-the-english-election-debate-tripped-the-quebec-campaign/)

in fact, almost i've almost never heard a ''political expert'' from outside the province really talk about the problematic aspect of the question. maybe they're buried under the rubbish, but man... it really seems nobody cares about the reason of this debacle. the answer is easy when it suits the stereotype: typical quebecers, they like to be victims, etc. etc. 

this situation is very frustrating to me, to be honest. it proves that ''left-liberal'' parts of canada still share the same easy tropes that their conservatives comrades have about us. it's a small thing, but it made it clear for me that we're still very far from a left that could unite the country from coast to coast.",conservatives

the cpc has no gusto. their more centrist policies were heading in the right direction this time. they actually had a something of an environmental plan, ect. the thing is, it's just not enough. most of their measures are half-assed or simply just won't accomplish what they claim they will. 

take their childcare policy for example. a tax credit. a freaking tax credit. i bet they took a long time to think that one out. it's bad policy compared to the alternative; complexe bilateral agreements that most provinces have already signed. maybe if 8 of the agreements hadn't already been negociated, it could have been more honest that a tax credit would help families sooner, but as it stands, that just wasn't true. tax credits help once a year, unless you set up monthly payments, which takes time  tax credits are also a regressive policy as they don't provide any benefit to the lowest income families. tax credits are unable to generate a broad policy vision that has objectives beyond throwing money at the problem. childcare is too complex an issue for a tax credit. families not being able to afford it is only one part of the issue. a tax credit doesn't involve targets for creating childcare spaces. it doesn't involve programs for training the people necessary to provide the childcare, ect.

if anything, i think covid has clearly demonstrated that some problems cannot be solved merely by throwing money at them or merely by individual or family unit actions. some issues require a systemic approach. look at alberta right now, will throwing a bunch of money at hospitals solve the health care capacity problem? no, it likwly won't, because what is missing is human ressources. trained professionals. which cannot simply be generated by throwing money at the problem, it takes time to build up human ressources. that is the kind of thing that requires a plan and many years. with covid, we didn't have the luxury of time and we just have to deal with that. however, with childcare, we should have a broader plan in place.

same goes for fighting climate change. it's the kind if think that requires a long-term plan and systemic change. we've had time to do that but hadn't quite gotten there yet. and we are running out of time on climate change too, we don't have time for half-measures.",conservatives

then for some reason at the last minute the liberals cut that exemption out. as it stands the bill would apply to you - that post you just made? the crtc could legally regulate it if the bill passed. they could say it's \"not in the national interest\" if they don't like what you said and demand it be taken down, even fine you. they could require that you post it in english and french, or that it has a certain percent of french content. they could decide it wasn't canadian enough. these are all things the law currently allows for broadcasters.

in another look, deviating from the nuclear family, is that \"progressivism\"? sure, maybe, but then you see all kinds of new mental health issues and societal cracks that may or may not be related. it might turn out that it wasn't a coincidence that almost every successful culture came up with institutions of marriage for a reason, and attacking that isn't actually \"progress\", we learned that it's the best way for society to advance 10,000 years ago .... or maybe not, but in encouraging a \"progressive\" lifestyle we shouldn't just assume that it's going to be better than how we've done things in the past. is making divorce super easy progressive, yeah. is it something i support, sure. is it \"progress that makes us better\" you can't assume that. having an easy out, could physiologically put you in a different mind set that \"we need to make this work for the children\". are people happier today than they were 50 years ago?

it is basically just political games.

yes, an investigation was launched between military police and the pentagon but it led to nothing, but it speaks to a wider issue of both parties and i would argue even if the pmo knew, they would never have removed vance because again pco did what they could and nothing came out of it.

yes, even the harper pmo knew about it and likely harper. did he stop it? obvious he never did anything and never stopped it.

the pm again gave revenue increases based on advice from the public service, all in line with the amount of time he served as cod staff.

so largely it was in line with the tenure and amount of time served.

the opposition may say this proves the pm hates the military and its members, but pco did what they could with the information, politicians do not investigate and the pm cannot investigate, and revenue increases are recommended by the public service.

as for being a feminist, within the confines of government, you need to have due process, so everyone has to have their voice heard whether it is victim or person causing the harm.

there is also indication that the pm may have given multiple revenue increases not just 2019 so this happened i believe 2 more times after 2019, but again it comes down to the public service and recommendations.

is there more the pm could have done, and based on launching an investigation himself, i would say no because he didn't have the details as he has stated before, and his office was merely passing on information when the pco was given it. so even if he knew allegations were passed on, it was largely in the jurisdiction of dnd and pco and officials in pmo.",liberals

i think it will never get to that point because despite the moral imperative to do so trudeau likely won’t, but if canada did stop selling arms and the us took that retaliatory action that would be massively inappropriate behaviour towards and ally making an independent and reasonable foreign policy decision. i don’t think biden would do it — he wants to be the nice guy too much and he‘s not going to take that kind of retaliatory action over canada abstaining from selling arms — and if he did that would reveal how completely out of proportion the coercion to support israel is. no sovereign nation should be coerced by another into selling arms, war crimes or no.",liberals

i saw way too many people simply not wanting trump out of a vapid hatred that once scrutinized had no actual backing other than the fact that they'd get their political news from talk shows or some other big group think that pushed the \"orange man bad\" narrative without any genuine base of argument, rather than an actual good political reason.

i don't support voting on blind emotion. even a vote based in honest ignorance is better than one based on delusional emotions, as one implies the person who cast it is genuinely doing their best to grasp the worlds complex geopolitical issues to the best of their ability. intentionally breeding group think and creating conditioned autonoma to win a vote is despicable no matter what political affiliation you have.

while i'm sure republicans were also guilty in this manner, i did not witness it nearly as vapidly or openly on a grand scale as the democrats who would more openly ostracize their family members simply for asking questions, and even talking about trump. i even in canada witnessed on several occasions people completely dehumanize people they had deemed as \"trump supporters\" and used it as a free pass to treat these people as poorly as possible. however when you actually went and talked to the majority of these people you'd find that most of them weren't even the fanatic cringe trump supporters, they just had nuanced opinions about how they preferred some policies of the trump administration over clinton, etc.

this is what really gets under my skin. i can understand healthy civil disagreement on political policies, but to go as far as comepletely dehumanizing someone and using it as a free ticket to treat them inhumanely even when they themselves have not participated in any radical behaviour, or have gone to any great lengths to hurt or damage people, but simply hold nuanced political views, that i can not tolerate. now i see the rise of the rage and resentment fueled by that mistreatment towards non radical conservatives and i am deeply afraid of the strife between both sides of the isle. there is still plenty of opportunity for both sides to lay down their pride and work together, however it will take both sides to stop demonizing each other and to stop creating delusional depictions of each other.

i for one just want to go back to basic primate cuddles with a good work life balance and caring for each other and have some oxytocin and endorphins back in my brain as commonplace, rather than feeling like i'm walking through a minefield everytime i talk. stop this whole giant dick measuring contests of i'm number 1 and the best and making everything a competition when it doesn't need to be. there is a right and a wrong time to have competition. 

competition should be used to determine who has the best way of accomplishing tasks so that knowledge can be used for the benefit of all man-kind, not just used for narcissistic purposes of proving you're better than everyone else. you can feel accomplished for being the best, but if you don't share that talent with other people than you've achieved nothing more than mere inflation of the ego and are no better a person for it.",conservatives

i'm kind of in the middle on this one. on the one hand i definitely think its' not a big deal for muslim women to cover up if they want to. i also don't think it's some uniquely muslim thing for people to experience pressure to behave a certain way that they may or may not like.  


on the other hand, it is true that large demographic changes can change the social fabric of the country. and canada is in a pretty precarious situation that way, because so many higher-ups insist we have no culture, and/or adhere to woke ideology (which is an extremely weak foundation because it's inherently divisive, incorporates a lot of victimhood and weakness, and is not always very logical). too many of us find it bigoted to even *discuss* what kind of culture *we* want, what the foundation of our values or culture are, how new people might impact that, and how to balance the these things in a way that honours both sides. theoretically that could mean that a big enough demographic shift (or alternatively, if a higher proportion of more extremist muslims move to the country), you could end up with legitimate social issues.   


honestly though, i don't know if canada has the guts to have an *honest conversation* about our values and how those values are impacted by immigration from cultures with very different ideals.... much less to stand up and say \"these are the values we adhere to, and while you're allowed to move here and largely do your own thing, these values are the standard for overall society here\". anyone who says it would be shot down as a bigot, maybe kicked out of the party (even the current conservative party).",conservatives

&gt;similarly in nb green-vote-splitting cost brian gallant the premier’s office despite him winning the popular vote and getting nearly the same seats as higgs.

brian gallant cost brian gallant the premiership. if he hadn't fucked up massively by outsourcing our healthcare services he'd still be premier. that pissed off a lot of people and kept the decade-old trend of one term premiers amongst the general discontent towards our choices. that higgs only managed one more seat in 2018 is merely a reflection that new brunswickers didn't trust him to have a majority. 

&gt;they replaced an environmentalist premier with a former irving oil executive...and then celebrated their “accomplishment”

lol, it's wild that people see the nb libs as remotely environmental. there's a reason why the beaverton does the old joke of \"the irving party won\" no matter if it's the pcs or the libs. they're all licking the boots of the irvings. neither of these parties is willing to enact a green enough plan or transformational change in any way. they govern for themselves. 

you're wrongly presuming that the green vote is a one-way liberal-to-green swing. and it really isn't. the green vote comes from a coalition of people disillusioned with the status quo parties. it's just as much green tories and previous non-voters as it is green liberals and former new democrats. as a social democrat with nb green membership, i'd spoil my ballot if the greens weren't an option. never voted pc or lib in my life and don't intend to unless these parties go through massive transformations. i simply do not trust them to govern.",liberals

trudeau suffers from an inconstant foreign policy. while big on the rhetoric of multilateral-ism and engagement, canada has become more isolationist under trudeau, dramatically scaling back foreign aid and effectively ending its role as a peacekeeper. while that can certainly be a choice, the combination of this choice with the decision to seek an un security council seat was discordant and made it difficult to understand where canada stands on major world issues. at home, his continued multilateral engagement rhetoric is outright dishonest. 

his biggest foreign policy successes come from where he has retained very strong cabinet ministers like freeland and champagne, and his disciplined neutrality in american politics (which predated trump's rise). 

electoral reform was a bald-faced lie and deeply disappointing. the mock surprise and shock at the ndp and cpc maintaining the exact positions they'd had since jump on this issue was very unimpressive.

and you fail to recognize that even within the context of cultural imperialism, it can be done with good intentions if the dominant culture's intent is to improve what the they believe are the mistakes, the failures, and the inadequacies of the lesser culture.    what the dominant culture may be doing is wrong, but it can easily seen to be done with good intentions.   they aren't trying to eliminate a people as they perceive because they don't tie \"people\" to \"culture\", but eradicate what they perceive to be bad elements in a \"culture\" so as to improve the lives of the lesser people.   even today, bringing democracy to a culture that doesn't have it is seen is a good intention - even if it may end up destroying the culture, altering them, they no longer may have their inherited roles for example, they become assimilated into the world order.

the point of the statement to which you replied is that, with regard to education, the cost increases to match the purchasing power of the consumer. it might not happen within 1 year, but it is certainly happening:

&gt; several recent studies have found evidence that other federal student aid programs drive of tuition increases. a [2015 study](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr733.pdf) found that a dollar of subsidized (non-plus) student loans increases published tuition by 58 cents at a typical college, with larger effects once reductions in institutional financial aid are taken into account. an [nber paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21967.pdf) issued last year concluded that changes to federal student loans are more than sufficient to explain tuition increases at private nonprofit colleges. and a [2014 analysis](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/does_federal_student.pdf) found that for-profit colleges eligible for federal student aid charged tuition 78% higher than that of similar but aid-ineligible institutions.

the problem i see with a conservative party is that what it means to be a conservative has changed over the decades and unfortunately those changes lead it away from the mainstream of canadian society. 

if you go back to mulroney’s progressive conservatives, they were about business and industry development, canadian unity and a robust presence on the international diplomatic stage. that’s it. no social conservatism, no anti-immigration, no christian values. they focused on governing the country.

fundy royal has only gone liberal twice in its entire history. new brunswick southwest has only gone liberal once after the 1960s (would you know that it used to be a liberal stronghold back in the day? curious how things change). 

these two seats in particular are what i would refer as the \"conservative belt of new brunswick\". they only flipped in 2015 because of the massive anti-harper wave that swept the region, but reverted back to their normal tendencies in the midst of a scandal-ridden trudeau in 2019. 

tobique-mactaquac is somewhat of a different beast. it has been quite swingy in modern times (liberal in 2004-2006, 2006-2008, 2015-2019). it's conservative overall, but contains a few liberal-minded francophone communities within its boundaries. had independent-minded harvey chosen to run again for the lpc in 2019, i think he would have pulled out a tight win, much like wayne long did in st john-rothesay. 

people there appreciate an independent streak in their politicians, and in rural atlantic canada in particular, local candidates count much more than most places. and based on nothing but gut feeling, richard bragdon looks like he's connected to his community, and would therefore give him the edge even if the lpc puts forward a good candidate. but we'll see.",liberals

while i have ideas about what policy is conducive to an ordered and virtuous society, i actually do not follow politics that closely. i generally don't even watch/read the news unless i hear through the grapevine that something major has happened (like the capitol incident). i don't sit at home sweating over what trump or trudeau is doing, unlike many of my more \"plugged in\" leftist and rightist friends.",liberals

gjn0h69,2021-01-17T03:32:10.000-08:00,"bloomberg: canada’s flawed vaccine plan sends snowbirds to u.s. for jab. there are three issues.

the first is apparently there is more evidence that the canadian healthcare system can not be described as universal if some elders in our community can get the vaccine, and if some can not. retirement residences are independent living facilities and have received or are earmarked to receive vaccines prior to those who live independently whether they live in a home or a multiresidential unit.

the second is it can only be described as an essential travel need to get a vaccine. if one can get it in a foreign country, is it a moral duty to go there so more people are vaccinated in our country overall?

the third issue is why is the foreign media more transparent and forthcoming about trudeau than out own media? apparently his blunder on obtaining the vaccine is regarded as such by every media outlet except those in canada.  same with his instructions not to wear a mask at the start of the pandemic. or his government ignoring advice on troops back from wuhan. or that it was non canadian outlets that were the first to break his multiple occurances of blackface. is there a reason that the media in canada is just uncritical of his populist antics?",liberals

gjn181b,2021-01-17T03:36:51.000-08:00,"listen up. here are the stakes. &gt;shame you feel that way. it's not all doom and gloom but i guess depending on one's beliefs, your perspective can be right as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;i do think that with time we do tend to accept more and more things. so of which i agree, seem like complete degeneracy. and i have no problem with gay marriage, abortion, reinterpreting gender roles, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;but, there are things that boggle my mind. a man/woman walking their partner on a leash in public? oh, they not hurting anybody! a child deciding he is female because he likes to wear girlish clothes and mostly has female friends? yeah that makes sense. a teenager being anti-canadian because we are an imperialist, genocidal state on stolen land? let him/her be, she will definitely be a law abiding canadian who will integrate in society just fine.

i'm sorry; i really do try to be respectful and charitable. but i just don't see how this is a principled stance. on what basis do you critique a woman walking her husband on a leash if you do not critique abortion, gay marriage, etc.? to me, the whole leash thing is not only disrespectful to the husband (and pathetic on his part), it is an inversion of the *telos* of men and women respectively, and of the family as well. it is the family structure that is foundational to society, and abortion undermines this value more fundamentally than the leash.

&gt;but, time always runs forward. we conservatives always want to preserve our culture, institutions and beliefs. we have every right to do so. but society will always change. however, it does not mean that society will just keep on moving further to the left. 

i think you are right in principle, and there may indeed be a rightist renewal sooner than i think due to more and more people waking up to the direction of society. but i think leftism has a certain entropic force behind it that makes resisting it harder. in any case, by preparing for a worst-case scenario, i may actually contribute to a better case scenario. that's partly why i have communicated doom and gloom with steps to give hope to the future.

&gt;in my opinion, there is no need to be concerned with what will happen in 20-40 years. live in the moment and plan for your future. and not the future of the whole world. i hope one day i will get married to a like-minded woman and have children. i would teach my children to be independent thinkers. my parents didn't make a conservative out of me. i became a conservative after going to university. i will let my kids decide their own future. and the world decide theirs.

i think this isn't a very right-wing way of thinking. appreciation with the past must be combined with concern for the future to ensure that the future does not too thoroughly abuse the gifts of the past. that being said, i think there is some value in a stoic mindset that appreciates the goods we still have and only worries about what we can control, while accepting what we cannot. so i take your point here. what i can control, however, is how i live my life and participate in my community, and i think the tactics i have laid out above are a decent start.

&gt;i will let my kids decide their own future. and the world decide theirs.

i appreciate the liberal perspective here. it makes a surface level of sense. but ultimately, i think it leads to the dissolution of values. if no one inculcates values in the next generation, then they will be forgotten. there is only so much you can do of course. i don't believe in honour killing and what not. but i certainly would use my words if i thought my children were not living honourable lives.

&gt;i agree with your suggestions and solutions on how to strengthen the conservative movement. i think you should write a book mate. you are very well spoken/written.

thank you! i think better people than i have already written better books on this matter than i could, but i appreciate the sentiment. if ever i write a book, it will either be fiction, or it will be a study of some literary classic. most likely *moby-dick*.

take care, and stay safe during this challenging time.",conservatives
