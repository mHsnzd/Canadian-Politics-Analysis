however, since there is no trudeau equivalent at the provincial level, singh’s brand would be much stronger at the provincial level. as the only young, hip, good looking, stylish media savvy leader in ontario, he could have had a lot more success. trudeau basically eliminates all of singh’s branding advantages, and he wouldn’t have to deal with a trudeau at the provincial level.",liberals

they really should have picked a different issue to start going after the lpc on. any video would have sufficed, given that they were happy to attack the lpc over a video that obviously follows twitter's rules.

twitter didn't even wait for a complicated issue that would complicated fact-checking. it only takes &lt;35 seconds to verify that the lpc wasn't trying to trick anyone, and that the video fails to meet twitter's definition of \"manipulated media\". the video uses fade-ins, which is the opposite of how you hide a cut in video. it takes about three minutes to debunk the idea that the lpc misrepresented o'toole in the process (the full video adds about 2 minutes of homework).",conservatives

any comparison of the cpc to foreign parties is bunk to me.  canada has a specific political alignment where our centre doesn't match the uk or australia or the usa.  every canadian party is left of the republicans and most of the rest of the democratic world as well.

h3ry58f,2021-07-01T16:28:11.000-07:00,"trudeau tells canadians to ‘be honest’ about our past in canada day statement &gt; his father wrote a white paper with jean chretien that, among other things, suggested abolishing all reserves and fully integrating first nations peoples. 

[joseph heath](https://www.academia.edu/43470485/two_dilemmas_for_u_s_race_relations) describes canada as having two models for cultural pluralism - basically, the quebec model (separate institutions) and the multiculturalism model (integration without requiring assimilation), often credited to pierre trudeau. both work reasonably well.

the quebec model works because the francophone minority is large and geographically concentrated. for indigenous peoples, it seems workable for larger first nations, but less so for smaller and more remote ones.

the 1969 white paper proposed the multicultural model for indigenous peoples, and was rejected.

&gt; ... it is possible to address a great number of issues on reserves through a strategy of “indigenous self-government,” which is to say, turning reserves into an order of government, with their own jurisdiction and powers [like the quebec model]. unfortunately, reserves vary enormously in size and geography, which dramatically affects their capacity to provide an institutionally complete society for their members. this in turn makes a uniform devolution of powers impossible. “self-government” means one thing on the kahnawake mohawk reserve, which has a population of over 8,000 and is situated next door to a major metropolitan centre. this reserve has both the means and the capacity to run a primary school system that functions entirely in mohawk. compare that to the red pheasant reserve, population 600, in rural saskatchewan. even if there were the capacity to deliver primary-language cree education, there is practically no economic opportunity on reserve, nor any obvious way of creating it. a self-governing minority nation in this case would refrain from providing members with the skills required for successful integration into the majority culture, but fail to provide a viable alternative set of institutions, that would allow for a comparable level of economic opportunity, political influence and social satisfaction. thus the multinational model [the quebec model] of cultural pluralism in this case becomes a recipe for marginalization. it allows members of the group to opt out of majority institutions, which on the one hand relieves them of the burden of having to integrate into a culturally alien set of practices, but on the other hand, denies them access to the not-inconsiderable benefits of these mainstream institutions (in particular, white-collar work in the modern economy). if the institutions of the minority nation are unable to compensate for the loss of those mainstream benefits, the result will be the emergence of significant inequality between members of the minority and majority groups.
&gt; 
&gt; ... conflict of this form [rejection of multiculturalism] arose in dramatic fashion in 1969, when the government of canada issued a “white paper” on indian affairs, proposing to abolish the indian act, phase out the reserve system (on the grounds that the policy of “separation” and “different status” “has led to a blind alley of deprivation and frustration”), and to integrate indians into canadian society as “equal” members. this proposal was emphatically rejected by indigenous leaders, not just as bad policy, but as a “betrayal.” the entire episode is now looked back upon as a dark period in crown-indigenous relations, and the white paper is routinely condemned as a template for “cultural genocide.”
&gt;
&gt; the mistake lay in **the federal government having laid out a road map for integration [multiculturalism] with a population group that instead favoured, and was entitled to demand, self-government [the quebec model]**. since that time indigenous policy in canada has remained very much stuck in a bind. many reserves are not economically self-sufficient and have no credible prospect of providing an institutionally complete social environment. yet neither are they able to equip their members with the capabilities required to achieve success in mainstream canadian institutions (the education system, the labour-market, etc.). the government cannot make up for the latter set of deficits too assertively, or pursue the standard set of [multiculturalism] policies to integrate first nations peoples, because that might be seen as encouraging members to live off reserve (and thus as promoting cultural genocide). the results are huge inequalities of opportunity (typically characterized in terms of the “third world” living conditions that prevail on many reserves) which the government then attempts to blunt by intervening in the administration of reserves in ways that are an affront to their sovereignty. the result is a classic stuck file, with self-government, integration and equality standing in relations of mutual antagonism.",liberals

this is actually a pretty good question! i would describe canada as a pluralistic, multi-national empire, something like the austro-hungarian empire, containing multiple peoples (english-canadians, french-canadians, many indigenous peoples, later immigrants).

canada has two models for cultural pluralism which work reasonably well, the quebec model (separate institutions) and the multiculturalism model (full integration without requiring you to give up your culture).

the residential schools were part of a disastrous attempt to forcibly assimilate indigenous peoples to an alien culture. obviously this predated multiculturalism (at the time english-canadians were proud to be part of the british empire, and the assumption was that western culture was superior). but for indigenous peoples, multiculturalism isn't the answer either - it was proposed in the 1969 white paper and rejected.

instead, the path we're on is to apply the quebec model to indigenous peoples (\"self-government\"), by establishing separate institutions. this seems like it should be workable for large and geographically concentrated communities, but is going to be much harder for smaller and more remote communities. maybe having smaller communities join forces will work, as in the yukon.",liberals

why wasn't it more regulated before trudeau, then? surely you're not implying that the lack of effective regulation in canadian telecom is an artifact of the past 6 years only.

h1lklwr,2021-06-12T17:12:21.000-07:00,"opinion: trudeau will fight discrimination against muslims – so long as they don’t live in quebec i get the ideal of keeping religion out of the workplace, but i just don't think this law goes about it in a way that's tolerable in a free society.

a few specific thoughts:

1. things get pretty dicey when we start talking about keeping religious people out of certain fields. there's nothing inherently nothing wrong with someone who's religiously zealous, as long as they behave appropriately, right? we're ultimately concerned with perceptions and behaviour, here. at least that's my approach as a relatively non-religious person.
2. i can't begin to count how many times i've been proselytized by christians who dress just like me. what does this law do to defend secularism from them? conversely, i can't think of one instance in my entire life where i've seen a muslim or sikh be religiously overbearing. most religions lack christianity's numbers, and don't have a culture of evangelism. why are minority religions the most impacted, unless the actual point of the law is to pressure them to assimilate or stay out of public life?
3. who's to judge what clothing is and isn't religious? i'd bet nobody would look twice at a government employee who displayed a quebec flag (you know the one with a cross on it). in the meantime, someone might wear a headscarf because their mother did, and not because of any particular religious devotion. this stuff is cultural and practical as much as it is religious.
4. if the concern is misbehaviour by religious public servants, couldn't we just fire them? seems a lot less trouble, and like it would impact the specific people who actually cause trouble.",liberals

h1lnlcy,2021-06-12T17:58:09.000-07:00,"angus reid alberta - ndp 41% - ucp 30% - wip 20% - abp 7% sort of. the thing about the more 'conservatively minded' folk here in alberta that i have noticed, is that many of them aren't against splitting off from eastern canada. the thing that keeps many of them from going that route, is getting bc, yukon, nwt and saskatchewan on board. perhaps manitoba too, but i get mixed results from people on that one.   


so the reason i bring this up is this. ndp supporters are kind of playing with fire in playing a split right game. as you put it, the split is allowing for an easier ndp win, but all it takes is for one of the two to decide to re-merge again to completely send that sideways. abp + ndp = 48% while wip + ucp = 50%. if ucp voters decide to go wip to spite kenny while also spiting ndp, then ndp now has a new ball game to play.   


abp is basically ndp's only hope of splitting the ucp more in a way that might help them. but in that regards, look over to saskatchewan to see what happens when \"provice\"&lt;party&gt; happens. sask party is a good example why you shouldn't let weird merger parties win right away in any way, since they can turn out to be a trojan horse for old powers that be to re-enter the seat of power. again, just ask saskatchewan about how well the skp is going. some will think it's fine, some will hate it. etc, etc. long story short though, is it's basically a return of the devine gov't in a lot of ways, through rosy liberal clothing (at the time, that façade has been mostly dropped.)  


finally, a point of contention if none else before has been contentious enough...  


isn't it kind of a sad failure that you need to split your opponent up into smaller groups just to win? shouldn't a more trustworthy and legitimate party be let to rule through an actual majority, not just a slightly larger portion than x other number of parties? yes, having more than the others is still winning... but is it? really?   


a real political win, is having 2/3rds of the vote or more, without needing to split it. anything less, is arguable as a close enough tie, and should probably be redone. how so?  


let's look at it federally. if liberals win a majority, then it's pretty fair to say that at least most canadians are okay with liberals. yet, it's not. why? because when there are 3-4 or more parties taking up a portion of the votes each, what that lead they have is really saying is \"we have a majority of the *people who voted*\" and not just that, but also you get to deal with this. since technically the sum of the other parties votes comes pretty close to a tie, or in some cases exceeds the winning party... you could make the argument that not only is that majority a false one through both examples in tandem, but you can also make the argument that because of all the people who also don't vote, the 'majority' winner should be forced to attain a winning tally that rivals that number as well.   


i.e. all new 'majority' governments should be forced to have to win under the pretense of having to beat the sum of the parties votes, and also the sum of those who didn't vote, since that's basically a demerit against all parties. they didn't vote because the parties weren't doing their job well enough.   


minority parties would become the new norm because of this rule, and would force all governments to accept a fact i am trying to explain to you here.   


that fact being this: the true majority of canadian voters, is often those who don't want the person who ends up leading the country. this is the same for most provinces as well. but because 1 party manages to get past that fucking post... we end up being run by often the exact person who shouldn't be running the country, province, city, town, municipality, etc, etc, etc.   


that is all. i am done now.",liberals
