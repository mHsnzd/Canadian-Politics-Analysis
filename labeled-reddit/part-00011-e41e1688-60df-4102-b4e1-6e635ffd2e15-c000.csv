however, given the evidence, the wishy washy announcements, and the fact that they let the numbers get ridiculously high, with hospitals over-loaded, is pure evidence that the measures the opc were taking were way&lt; way too one sided towards appeasing big business. something ford and the opc has had a problem with since they took office.

trudeau is reaping what he sowed.  it was 100% predictable after his earlier statements that people would be jumping all over him if anything went wrong later.

**\"new study shows trudeau has fulfilled 92% of promises in full or in part - best record of any pm in 35 years.\"**

i think they were correct on electoral reform too... the other parties wouldn't agree on what reform to do. and doing it the wrong way would open-up fissures in canadian society, especially with how diverse and spread-out canada is.  i wrote more about that here:

that's just silly.  if a gun is the only thing keeping you alive, it's because you've developped an unhealthy attachment or addiction  to it.  it's just as likely that the gun and the obsessive culture around it is part of the problem. that's certainly the case for marc lepine and alexandre bissonette.

\\&gt; that aside though, changing what types of firearms can be purchased will not have any impact on suicide at all.

red herring. i was talking about mandatory mental health assessments before people are allowed to purchase any firearm, perhaps even mandatory annual mental health assessments for all gun owners like they in germany and switzerland. these countries have both higher rates of gun ownership and less shootings because of a culture that emphasizes more personal responsiblitly and stricter regulation of gun owners.

&gt;that link between health professionals and authorities is a key to gun safety in switzerland, which unlike most of europe has one of the highest per capita rates of gun ownership in the world ‚Äì after the us and yemen, according to the small arms survey. the prevalence of guns here is rooted in swiss tradition of compulsory military service for men. that means most swiss gun owners are psychologically screened. there have been mass shootings in switzerland, including one in 2001 that took 14 lives in the local parliament in zug, but never in a school. in switzerland, doctors are encouraged to inform the police if they believe a person could be a danger to himself or someone else. in that case, police, under the swiss weapons act of 1999, have the right to investigate and take an individual‚Äôs arms away, says lulzana musliu, a spokeswoman for the federal office of police in bern. (germany has similar laws.) philip jaff√©, a forensic psychologist in switzerland, says this underlines a responsible gun culture, based on trust, on display in his country. ‚Äúconfidentiality ends with the level of threat that the person may represent, which makes a lot of sense,‚Äù he says. ‚Äúwho can evaluate the threat level better than a physician?‚Äù there is no national arms registry in switzerland ‚Äì the idea was rejected in a 2011 referendum ‚Äì but there is an information system where all refusals for firearm permits, including for psychological or criminal reasons, are listed. the police have access to this information system, which is consulted each time someone wants to purchase a firearm. ‚Äúif, for example, i am in zurich and i want to get an arm, but they can see i‚Äôm a violent person, i have beaten up my wife, i won‚Äôt get the arm, and not in another canton either, because all of the systems of the police are linked,‚Äù ms. musliu says.[https://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2018/0326/in-europe-preventing-gun-violence-often-starts-with-mental-health](https://www.csmonitor.com/world/europe/2018/0326/in-europe-preventing-gun-violence-often-starts-with-mental-health)",conservatives

and each province/locale has its own unique circumstances, so it's basically impossible for the federal government to create a \"one size fits all\" solution. until last year, atlantic canada had stagnant housing prices, and a policy to cool ontario/bc prices would cause problems there. even now, they still have different situations.

housing policy is better suited to provincial and municipal governments, to tailor it to their circumstances.

personally, i would ban foreign ownership in canada, because i think corrupt money from china (people who got rich off ccp regime connections) is the main problem.

&gt;switzerland, germany, and austria can probably help us out with running trains through snow, of our 150 years of doing it isn't sufficient.

my statement was in relation to high speed rail.  can you tell me that 1 foot of new, heavy, almost ice, accumulation overnight isn't somehow a problem for hsr?  i'm not staying that it is an insurmountable one, but neither is plane deicing. 

&gt;&gt; so, the challenge is if you get the train station in the core, is you still need to get to the core to get the train. what have we gained with hsr?
&gt;
&gt;just like there is a train to the airport, you can actually take a train to the train station. a number of you comments seem to ignore the existence of regional public transit in these cities, and the improvements that would be made to service the thousands (or tens of thousands) of arriving and departing hsr passengers a day.

my comments consider the reality that there is a finite amount of money and being able to afford billions for hsr and billions for upgrading region transit is likely not going to happen.


i have yet to see the business case for the investment of a hsr line between to and montreal that justified the risk of expenditure of billions of dollars to address transporting of no more than 6 million people.

sure you could expand that and add the whole of southern ontario, ottawa, quebec city, and maybe double that population but you would easily double the cost. 

hsr requires dedicated rail lines, grade separated from the road, with very tight tolerances exacerbated by the fact that we have temp swings from -30 to +40, and salt spray in the air from the local road ways that corrode or rust everything.  you can say that europe deals with these things but i don't believe off hand that they desk with the same type of temperature swings over shirt periods like we do.  i might be wrong...",liberals

as far as shifting to sustainable transportation, you're right that the carbon tax alone isn't going to change everything over. but it's already financially viable to switch to evs if you drive a lot, and i think the tipping point will inch downwards with time. it'd get there a lot faster if we doubled the carbon tax, but if you go any further than there's a political appetite for all you do is ensure you lose the next election and nothing gets done.

modern parties and leaders don't seem to be grooming up and comers as leaders, and so leadership battles become bloody affairs often staring outsiders to the party, that do more damage to the party in the med/short term. 

often these strong leaders stay on too long and either wear out their welcome with canadians (harper) so that the new leader is never given a chance, or with the party (chr√©tien) resulting in infighting by ambitious up and comers that weaken the party.

hdng6u8,2021-09-20T09:02:16.000-07:00,"why i voted ppc o'toole showed no leadership in this campaign. when it came to the oic gun ban he back down instantly in an attempt to keep away the media instead of showing leadership he showed his true colours. he just wants to be the leader and no responsibility attached to it. the lack of spine is what killed his chances, no conviction, no beliefs, no values on display so judging if he could be material for leading the country became obvious he wasn't. 

the step towards the center is predictable, o'toole took his gamble knowing the ppc cost the cpc 6 seats (number just from a few posts i saw on here) last election and instead of trying to reclaim the support the cpc lost, he lost more support than he could gain. there isn't enough fiscally conservative but socially left people to make up a growing base, especially when you have no direction. maybe try eco fascism, they might get those toronto moms.

the cpc's internals will determine if the party goes right or left next election. as we don't have them my bet is they go for a michael chong type candidate so they can go for the reddit voters who said they would vote for them.

what is the cpc doing regarding limiting access to firearms more than what we have seen in canada in the past. we will never have a 2nd amendment style bill, from anyone. we have \"freedom of expression\", and i can guarantee you that the cpc will have noting to do with any bills that limit that &lt;cheers in jordan peterson&gt;. 

what way of life will be impacted. we already have freedom of expression and a cpc government will stop ridiculous virtue signaling shit like bill c-16.

the ar 15 is a semiautomatic rifle that is restricted in canada.  every legal ar15 is registered to an owner who has a restricted pal  and took a course and passed a written and practical test.  every rpal holder in canada has their name run through an electronic criminal record check everyday.  restrcited guns are required to be stored in a safe or locked in a cabinet with an additional mechanism like a trigger lock or cable lock.  given that there has never been a person shot in canada by a licensed and registered ar15 should we ban  the ar15?

agasint racist argement to closure borders with china;  you have to shut down the border to all counties to be effective, and even those have proven to have very little effect; countries that have successful measures at the border (e.g. south korea) have people install an app on their phones to track them so that they ca trace, contact, and quaranteen people who've been out of the country and exposed the virus; is that what we want in canada? 

\\&gt; were unable to establish early basic screening protocols at ports of entry

legitimate criticism; but again, it's tracking everyone coming in form other countries using their cell phones and contact tracing using this data that has proven to be the most effective method of fighting the spread of this disease; this is impossible in canada because provinces are responsible for contact tracing; in places like taiwan and south korea, the national government is responsible for both.  

\\&gt; maintained lax border restrictions established pandemic kabuki theatre quarantine hotels that failed to stop variants of concern from entering the country and‚Äîdespite a virtually limitless budget‚Äî

no large country did. the only countries that did are small countries like israel and sanmarino, which don't need huge supplies and have control over contact tracing and quaranteen methods. we curtailed that in quebec using a simple curfew, rapid testing, and contact tracing. thsi is on the premiers of ontario and alberta for failing to learn anything during the covid crisis. there really is no excuse for their negligence.",conservatives

&gt;from one genocidal nation to another ‚Äì please stop what you‚Äôre doing? do something about your genocide, and we‚Äôll do something about ours?

outside of our own destruction of our indigenous people, we have our us allies that engage in mass incarceration, where through the 13th amendment prisoners lose many rights and are essentially slaves for cheap labour. 

what leverage do we have for pointing out these atrocities. would anyone hear make an adjustment in their personal lives if someone called them out while being openly hypocritical?

both are atrocities, we just can't measure or compare them in a way that is meaningful. so what is this push of anti-china sentiment for, to increase tensions to foster anti-china sentiment as we lose economic dominance (through the us). 

instead of focusing on what changes need to be made internally to plan for a functioning economy in the future, we instead point fingers and distract from how our leaders knowingly led us here in the first place. 

no one forced industry to move to china, no one forced china to manufacture so much of what we rely on, they were business decisions made for profit. now china is more organized, has a unified direction, and all we can do is buff up our military spending and hear the endless hypocritical talking points daily.

oh no, china may be spying on us, we already are all spied on and private companies influence our data to push us to consume. our media is bought and manufactures consent. human rights abuses, well we do them too and we have a very long, easily accessible history of screwing over countries around the world for profits. or how about the constant fear mongering of communism, despite most people have zero working definition of what socialism, communism, or state capitalism are. 

china, like the ussr abandoned the transitional stage to communism pretty quickly. so we are competing on forms of capitalism, for ours we have private industry at the top, followed by party/government, and the people. for china, the government is on top, followed by private industry, and the people. the difference being that it is much easier to grow and meet needs when there is a unified direction, and we are well on the track to losing. 

by 2028 china is expected to overtake the us economy, five years sooner than expected. do we really think this is going to be stopped by buffing up innovation and reimagining how we structure our economy. no, it will be through increasing military spending, increasing surveillance, locking up more people, and keeping people compliant through fear as their lives become worse.",liberals

be aware, i studied both symbolic logic and political science for my degree, as well as a bit of history.  labour will vote ndp to a greater extent if someone doesn't campaign better on jobs - fact.  that's why cr√©tien won in 1993 - he campaigned on jobs.  i never said housing wasn't important - but feasibility for the working stiff in a strained economy has a solid bearing on the realization of any goal which favours home ownership over rent-slavery or outright homelessness for canadian citizens.   while i appreciate the debate, you're not reading what you're refuting.  i am only saying the ndp's campaigns, attention, and press could be better-spent on issues that would actually get them votes and seats.  i never said anything about how they should vote on any issue.

labour and jobs

electoral reform

social programs

...in that order, would be my suggestion, for their campaign efforts and publicity.  the ndp started as labour, and in my humble opinion, will only ever *finish* anything besides a minority government, as a labour party.  spread the attention too thin, and your votes will be just as thinly-spread.  strategic voting is a thing btw - and it goes on a party's top-noted-priorities and principles - not a smattering of unkeepable promises.  i have reservations, given the track record, that the ndp will outdo the liberals at being liberal, per the article, because they are not electable.  i only feel the federal ndp could do a far better service to their country by staying in their lane and taking advantage from the votes they actually depend on, including mine.",liberals

as for everything else you‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs your view that‚Äôs spelling that out. personally i don‚Äôt see it, because every motion has died more and more each time it‚Äôs come up. the last time it came up it was denied unilaterally and the member was no longer able to bring it up because it didn‚Äôt get across the board support. as canadians we know where we stand. soft c l conservatives know as well, and even with a majority government voting in majority by ten members they could still not pass a motion; which is basically just them wanting to talk about what constitutes ‚Äúlife.‚Äù; never mind legislation. 

we can spout conspiracies and trumpism all we want, but we simply don‚Äôt have that level of political division in canada to support it. our government is set up in such a way where right wing authoritarianism is made incredibly difficult and inefficient. we most definitely are going through a unique time in the world with regards to right wing nationalism, but i feel that as canadians we are much stronger and have more controls to help avoid the pitfalls of such a thing than other countries may.

as for overpowering the party? no, not it the first go at least. but it becomes a vicious cycle: the socons get a platform in the rural west to spew their nonsense, this greater visibility and presence in caucus turns off red tories in central canada causing them to lose seats there, by attrition the socons are a now a bigger part of the caucus, and the whole thing starts over again.

as long as that is the fundamental value system, a universal basic income will never catch on, no matter what the data show. conservatives will never get on board with paying lazy people money for doing nothing.

resource extraction is a significant chunk of our annual output. i have no problems with pointing out downsides of resource extraction but i really would prefer if we could have an honest discussion about how to replace the dollars lost in transition.

i fear that in this era of record deficits there is an attitude of indifference to the dollars and cents of government operations. a feeling that the revenue side of the equation is less important. we can push it off to the side, but we can't ignore how much resource revenue contributes to our social systems. and the hole that it is going to leave in our finances eventually. we were facing structural deficits long before covid. how can we make up the ground lost before covid, during covid, all without one of our most valuable industries?

there was an article here yesterday that  did not get much traction but it reported ottawa had increased spending on consultants by 30% since 2015 and a similar increase in full time staff. they are spending $1.30 for every $1.00 they were spending in 2015. just on hr. these trends of lower revenue and higher expenses will need to be reconciled eventually.

if my fellow canadians want to reduce extraction and purposefully reduce our national wealth in an attempt to improve the environment, i am very happy to have that discussion. but reducing the national wealth has other knock-on effects as well that shouldn't be ignored, but they are. resource extraction pays for a lot of the things we love about our social safety net. lets not drive full speed off the cliff until we have a new and robust net to catch us.",liberals
