&gt; those in support of a ban or further restrictions recognized that while firearms could still be available illegally if a ban were implemented, further restrictions could reduce the number diverted to illicit purposes. some noted legal firearms are used in violent crime (e.g., in rural areas, domestic violence). the strongest supporters of a ban suggested handguns and assault style weapons should not be available to anyone except law enforcement and military.

it’s not that people don’t understand the stats, it’s that they just take the stance of “less is more” in the ultimate sense. 

no amount of statistics you provide is likely to change that, and honestly, as someone who comes from a rural community and appreciates the need for hunting and even sport shooting, the second someone starts spitting out selective stats on these issues it’s the second i tune out. these walls of text don’t do much to convince anyone who isn’t already mad.

having said that - it's going to be a liberal minority and probably a decently strong one. it was looking like they'd lose 15 seats or so, i'm now thinking it may be more like 4 or 5. if that. 

erin o'toole had a great start but then just went into glide mode and had nothing in the gas tank. after he started to nose down with the gun flip flop there was just nothing at all that might bring him back up. it's like he gave up.  the debates were ok but nothing to get excited about and the last 10 days he's either been boring as hell or trying to explain alberta, which is a trap he should never have been in. it's like he thought he could work for 2 weeks and then just slide. and it's like he thought conservative voters would forgive his flip flop, or that somehow it would impress liberal voters. and neither turned out to be true. 

normally i'd say this wasn't a bad first run. mistakes were made but he did well too in some respects and he's walking away without having been branded a white supremacist. he could run again and do better.

so, imagine a global organization having to pay sweatshop employees bonuses as well...oh btw, those funds have to be paid into a canadian bank account. another way to improve the livelihoods of sweatshop employees and by extension, canadian employees is have wages deposited into a canadian bank account, and delivered in-trust/escrow to the country where employees live. that bank account is subject to audit by canadian fair work authorities/cra.  what this does is it prevents or mitigates the risk of shit organizations blindly contracting work out and getting slave-owners to get away with rape and murder, literally.  this drives up the cost of manufacturing overseas, and sure cost of goods will increase, but now there's less incentive to outsource.  furthermore, any one working for a subcontractor of a canadian business is subject to canadian work place laws, in terms of harassment, bullying, ot, and safe work environments.  a handbook detailing this is to be distributed and employees overseas are required to have a minimum of 1-days paid orientation day.  give those sweatshop employees access to canadian fair work laws, and profits decrease, more people are lifted out of poverty, and manufacturing overseas is again, disincentivized. 

now, this may discourage companies from establishing themselves in canada, but this could be a condition of doing business in canada.  canada is small-fry, but we also have a strong consumer base. a reliable one, too. 

now, i'm not saying that overseas subcontracted employees should be paid in the equivalent of a canadian employee, e.g. $25ca/hr. whatever the market value for a seamstress in thailand would be, that's what the employee gets, in cad. so if 1000baht is the weekly take-home, and that's $1.75, then $1.75 gets put in a canadian bank account for that employee.  eliminate the transaction fees banks charge for these arrangements, because banks charge exorbitant amounts for transnational transactions; however, this could mean that canadian banks can establish operations in those countries? 

it's pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but addressing wealth inequality in canada means we have to address global wealth inequality.  we can't dictate the laws in other countries, but we can extend the purview of laws for companies that operate overseas, to a certain degree. thereby empowering overseas employees.  for example, snc has shown us that canadian laws can extend to overseas operations.  

the uber-capitalists will say, \"let the free market handle it\", but we've seen what the \"free market has done: record bonuses, record bailouts, exponential wealth increase for the wealthy, meanwhile, wages have stagnated.  there's no such thing as a free market, just like there's no such thing as a free lunch.",liberals

why on god's green earth would trudeau step down after a minority? the lpc may be cynical careerists but they're not stupid, there's no point in killing the golden goose just because it lays fewer eggs. if the lpc get a minority they'll just keep on keeping on until he decides he's done.

hell, even if they *lose* i don't think they'll turf jt unless it's to a cpc majority. if it's a minority trudeau will likely say \"hang on let me joe clark this guy\" and the lpc will let him. 

why? because, currently, justin trudeau *is* the liberal party. he has an iron grip on the caucus, the party apparatus, and the base. despite the amount of hate he gets he's still the party's greatest asset. even after he steps down he's still going to be the power behind the throne in the party (unless he truly gets blown out of the water but even then he'll still have influence.)

even if the party did want to get rid of him who's going to replace him?  sure freeland is heir apparent but the best way to lose that title is to piss off the king and she doesn't have the influence to push him out if the liberals still form government, minority or not. carney? that's press pundit fanfiction. he could probably grab a ministry if he wanted but he's got a ways to go before he could be leader.

yes the liberals have a history of factionalism but the 2011 massacre got rid of most of the old guard so everybody who currently has any influence in the party is from the class of 2015, i.e team trudeau.  there is no martin scheming against trudeau's chretien.

the ppc is a symptom of the problem, and the problem is that there is a significant portion of the electorate that had no party that aligns with their values. the progressives are promising shit they can never or will not deliver on (electoral reform anyone?)

the conservatives left their base and took the progressive too far in the cpc. this is why they lost. 

as far as capitalism goes it’s the governments job to represent us in holding the capitalists back. but when you print more money than all the other pms combined in just 6 years, and not ever have a dream of a balanced budget, the capitalists are rubbing their hands together with all the money they’re going to make.

hqhuc4s,2021-12-29T10:35:54.000-08:00,"globe editorial: how françois legault remade politics in quebec, and canada, in 2021 the comparison between the bc ndp and the caq is very interesting to me because of what it says about the evolution of the two party systems.

for bc, one of the notable features of the province's politics from the wac bennett era to 2017 was that the catch-all party of the right, be it social credit or the liberal party, always managed to win both right wing and the moderate voters you pointed to in your comment with the ndp never able to win that middle ground. in essence, the only chance for the ndp to form government would be when the centre-right party splintered or exploded as it did in 1972 and 1991. now it seems clear that something has shifted in bc. the bc ndp under horgan has managed to win the middle ground in the province in a way the party never has before. at the moment it seems that the path to government for the liberal party of bc is for the ndp to explode or splinter. in that sense, bc has seen a reversal of fortune between the two major parties even if the parties themselves and the overall system hasn't really changed.

quebec by contrast has seen something drastically different. the caq's victory in 2018, and all subsequent polling, has indicated that the province's previous party system has been shattered. the pq vs. liberal era seems to be at an end, with both parties husks of their former selves. indeed, some political scientists specializing in quebec politics have theorized that quebec is currently in a consolidation era between the old party system and a new one where either the pq or qlp will simply disappear from the relevancy.

regardless it is an interesting comparison in my opinion, simply because of what it says about the two provinces. in bc you have a shift in where the middle park their votes, as it were. in quebec you have an apparent shift in the party system itself. i am very interested to see how politics in these two provinces evolves going forwards.",liberals

[canadians increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees – study](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/28/canadians-immigrants-refugees-study-environics-institute)


&gt;despite a global pandemic that has destroyed economies and fanned nationalism around the world, canadians say they are increasingly open to welcoming immigrants and refugees.

&gt;a new study from the polling firm environics institute found that attitudes among canadians have become increasingly positive, even as millions remain out of work and the country faces grim economic projections.

&gt;“these views are not a blip. they’re not chance. they seem to be deeply rooted and widely spread,” said andrew parkin, executive director at environics.

&gt;since 1976, the focus canada survey, administered by environics, has periodically sampled canadians to gauge their views on the topic.



&gt;the latest results, released in early october, show for the first time ever that canadians are more likely than not to reject the idea that immigrants are not adopting canadian values.

&gt;at the same time, a large majority of canadians continue to see immigrants as critical to the canadian economy and don’t feel they take jobs away from other canadians.

[the study referenced here](https://www.environicsinstitute.org/docs/default-source/project-documents/fc-fall-2020---immigration/focus-canada-fall-2020---public-opinion-on-immigration-refugees---final-report.pdf?sfvrsn=bd51588f_2)",liberals

h227f15,2021-06-16T16:28:11.000-07:00,"jenny kwan: clearly, the liberals' current approach to housing is failing canadians perhaps you can break down where the money is going? 

it’s important to note that most of that is existing spending. [as per the pbo](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/documents/reports/2019/housing_affordability/federal%20spending%20on%20housing%20affordability%20en.pdf):
&gt;as noted previously, the national housing strategy was marketed as a “$40- billion plan” or as a “$40-billion federal investment”. in reality, the strategy committed to $16.1 billion in new federal planned spending ($14.0 billion for cmhc and $2.1 billion for esdc).


also, the government combines loans and grants when they’re advertising those large figures:
&gt;	combining loan and contribution amounts

&gt;contributions and loans are fundamentally different in their cost to government and ability to influence behaviour. because loans must be repaid, they provide less of a financial incentive than a direct contribution of the same face value. the budgetary costs associated with loan programs arises from provisions for credit risks or insurance, interest timing mismatch and operating costs. for example, the budgetary cost of the $3.75 billion in loans available under the rental construction financing initiative (prior to budget 2019) is only $0.3 billion.

an later:
&gt;the rental construction financing initiative (rcfi) similarly provides low- cost loans to encourage the construction of rental housing. the main differences are that the rcfi has more relaxed affordability criteria, only provides loans, and does not require the support of another level of government. the rcfi was authorized to distribute $2.5 billion in loans under budget 2016, which was increased to $3.75 billion in budget 2018.30 budget 2019 provided additional loan authority for the rcfi to distribute an additional $10 billion in loans over 9 years, entailing a fiscal cost of $727.1 million over the term of the national housing strategy and bringing the total budgetary cost of the rcfi over the term of the national housing strategy to $1.0 billion.

this year the government announced another $12 billion in funding for, you guessed it: rcfi, which is closer to a $1 billion subsidy once you factor in loan repayments. the government seems to like this program since nearly all the new funding since the nhs began has gone to this, probably because it makes the housing strategy sound much bigger. rcfi accounts for about half of the 160,000 units over 10 years that is promised under the national housing strategy. rcfi is not focused on social or even affordable housing, it’s almost all for-profit. affordable under rcfi is often above the average market rent for an area, in ottawa anything under $2,750 is considered affordable. it’s also [estimated](https://carleton.ca/cure/wp-content/uploads/cure-brief-12-rcfi-1.pdf) that 96% would have been built anyway without the program, but developers opt for the lower interest rates offered under the program for projects they had planned and the government gets to take credit for them all.

caq - the caq is all francois legault, where his name is actually engraved on the party name. his mp's and cabinet ministers have no leeway, so their political orienetation doesn't really matter, as they are mostly opportunists running for the side that is is winning. you do things legault way. you wear suits. you wear ties. he mostly represents a certain type of small-town, authoritatian quebec businessman, a boss, and the closest analogy you can find to him is duplessis and lucien bouchard: pro-business, conservative, quebec nationalist, authoritarian, and sees separation mostly as a threat to pry away powers from the federal governemnt. money trumps everything with guys like this in the end.  appeals to the oldest demographic in quebec.   pretty much the old union nationale.

qs - idealistic, progressive urban left wing party like ndp. they don;t even have a leader, they're so left wing. they started out in montreal with pqistes tired of white  big-business guys like bouchard and legault running that party.   very green, probably make green parties irrelevant. they are officially seperatist, but since they had their greatest success in montreal bringing in anglophones and immigrants (who are left-of center and federalist)  and realize that it will  probably be the money  like legault and peladeau calling the shots in an independent quebec, they are somewhat tepid on separation right now.  thus as legault has been cannibalizing the pq form the right, the qs has been cannibalizing the pq from the left. their main place for expansion is montreal. i would not count out a sweep of the island of montreal if the liberals collapse.

pq - hardcore seperatist. there are still enough of them in quebec. legault can't be too moderate on  red meat nationalist issues like language, immigration, and separation or the pq will siphon off votes. they are not to be written off. for some reason, they held onto their seats in northeastern quebec.  i don't get that, but it shows how important regional bases have become in surviving quebec politics.

liberals - once coasted on being the only federalist party. the liberals have become a precarious alliance of centre-left anglophones and minorities and right-wing, pro-business francophones from montreal.  the might be wiped off the map now, or their relative youth and renewal might appeal to young centrists outside montreal.",liberals
