hin0yd9,2021-10-29T23:12:59.000-07:00,"questions i have for conservatives. &gt;the first one being: what do you think about the bloc quebecois?

not a huge fan of them, only because i think they ignore a huge part of quebecois historical identity. if they didnt ignore this essential part of historical quebec culture i would actually support them, maybe even put them in first place out of all the parties. the main thing they forget is that, quebec is originally a catholic/religious region. its identity was inseparable from religion. but after the quite revolution, this changed. now quebecois are fighting a uphill battle due to this loss of identity. it is quite likely that the bloc quebecois wouldnt have needed to exist today, if it wasnt for the negative aspects of the quite revolution. specifically the huge drop in birth rates across the french population, who had first lead the country in this stat has hit them hard. [there is a funny but sad song i heard on the internet that kind of points to this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef92-usivzq&amp;ab_channel=ingen)

(in addition, i dont like that the bloc has this idea floating around that they want to separate from canada. )

[here is a video explaining what i said in short that you may like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvjh8bltfri&amp;ab_channel=tumblarhouse)

&gt;also, is quebec more liberal or conservative?

that is a really hard question. i think if it wasnt for the quite revolution quebec would have been the conservative hub of canada. but with how things went, and looking at today. quebec is probably a likely mix between the two. obviously the country side is more conservative than the cities.

&gt;so what are the general values of conservatives?

people actually dont understand this, often they confuse classical liberal values to conservative values. i always bring up this quote by a great conservative scholar who says ***\"on one reading of events, indeed, conservatism arose as an attempt to hold on to the values of kinship and religion in communities that were being reorganised by a purely political law.\"***

so conservatism in short is based on protecting and sustaining a healthy community often based on religious values. this is one of the biggest reasons conservatism thrives in more rural areas than urban areas. the often heard critisism of urban areas is its isolation it gives you in the midsts of hundreds of thousands, or millions of people. there is first a lack of strong community to begin with, then there is also often a lack of traditional religion. so this will tell you why some provinces are less conservative than others.

but in general conservatism encourages personal responsibility. not to just ones self. but rather to society as a whole. again quoting roger scruton.

***\"disloyalty to the household is a form of disloyalty to the self, since it involves the rejection of the conditions from which will and reason first emerge.\"***

***\"hence it is an essential part of freedom to recognise obligations that are not freely chosen\"***

&gt;finally, why are you a conservative? and why should someone be a conservative?

if you like order, if you like preserving your culture in a healthy way, if you like the idea of personal responsibility from everyone. if you like the idea of a good mix of individualism and collectivism called communitarianism. then conservatism is for you.

if you are more conssernde about the freedom for you to seek pleasure, if you are more concerened about freedom from society, if you are more exited by the fact of not preserving a culture and its tradition. likely then conservatism is not a good fit for you.

&amp;#x200b;

in terms of economics. conservatives can be on the right or left of the spectrum. but one cant be a conservative without emphasizing those values i brought up above. you can be as right-wing as you want on economics, but if you dont want to have the conservative mindset, you are just a libertarian. so that is a good way to look at where you stand.

if you want you can try this test and tell me where you land: [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/08/opinion/republicans-democrats-parties.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/08/opinion/republicans-democrats-parties.html)

also here is a conservative values test: [https://afunhumaninter.github.io/conservavalues/](https://afunhumaninter.github.io/conservavalues/)

&amp;#x200b;

also you should know that their are many different types of conservatives. im just talking about historical pure conservatism. today most conservatives in the west are \"liberal-conservatives\", \"libertarian conservatives,\" and some are pure conservatives like me.",conservatives

wages under a certain multiple of the [ccpa's living wage](http://livingwagecanada.ca/index.php/about-living-wage/what/), must be brought up to that living wage, and then have statutory annual increases of something at least a bit more than inflation in the previous 12 months.

anything else just repeats the cycle of exploitation and deepens inequality, because those with wealth are easily growing it 10-50% every year without having to fight anyone for crumbs for decades.

for context, the **\"fight for $15\" campaign in the states started in 2009**. of course that's usd but it makes it even worse for cad, even [considering gdp per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparison_of_canadian_and_american_economies#:~:text=in%202016%20the%20gdp%20per,years%20between%201980%20and%202017) ($44,820 usd in canada, $57,638 in the us in 2026, or +28% south of the border). [according to the bank of canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/), $15 in 2009 would be worth $18.69 today, or almost 25% more than when the $15 number started getting punted around.

even **alberta of all places** [changed to $15 in 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimum_wage_in_canada)!

no, this whole thing feels like interpersonal drama that no one is willing to speak to yet. and it must be serious because paul has shown that she's very willing to utilize her race, gender and religion to negatively frame her opponents. while i doubt these factors tell the whole story, it's interesting that so many possible candidates are willing to go on the record against paul's leadership when they're vulnerable to charges – genuinely perceived or falsely alleged – of racism, antisemitism, or misogyny. to me, their risk means that must be something genuinely at stake that the media hasn't gotten to the bottom of yet.",liberals
h6sen6c,2021-07-27T13:25:16.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access so, let's start with the fact that abortion can't be criminalized in canada. it's a violation of your right to security of person and to your medical privacy. abortion can't even be limited on the basis of something like \"medically necessary\" because that's also privileged medical information. so the government can't just fund some abortions, it's all or nothing.

given that fact, if the government didn't fund abortion, then abortion would basically only be available to the rich and maybe the insured (medical procedures cost a lot out of pocket, see the us). that's a sizeable portion of the population who won't have access to it. history tells us that these people won't just not have abortions, they'll seek out other less-safe ways to have them. this will lead to further harm to some people and increase the strain on the funded portion of our healthcare system.

you might further argue that not funding abortion essentially denies people the right to security of person and, given that most other life-saving procedures are funded, that therefore this should be funded also. 

essentially, fully funding abortions for anyone wants one respects the court ruling on the topic, supports women's right to choose and medical privacy, reduces the burden on the healthcare system from more dangerous abortion methods, and ensures life-saving medical procedures are available to any canadian who needs them without an undue burden of proving that it's necessary",liberals

that's misleading. trudeau's middle class tax cut was cutting the $40k-$120k tax bracket, so that means to get the maximum benefit of that tax cut you'd have to make $120k-$200k after deductions. middle class people, those earning around $40-80k, got peanuts to nothing from the cut. it was a tax cut on the upper-middle class; the middle class and working class got nothing.

hhl09ar,2021-10-21T14:39:50.000-07:00,"'stirring up sentiment': trudeau pours cold water on kenney’s equalization vote honestly i've run some serious numbers on both with some real pros and neither are viable. alberta less than quebec to be honest. but neither. 

and i ran those numbers when alberta was in significantly better shape. 

to really dig into it is a massive undertaking. to give just one example of something most people spouting off about the numbers miss, consider interprovncial migration of the elderly and of the young during economic crisis. 

one of the reasons alberta has such a 'young' (average) population is because a huge percent of their population moves to bc when they retire. bc is the only province that has more people moving to it from alberta than the other way around. elderly people cost the most money to the health care system. that has a huge benefit for alberta that would stop dead if it were a seperate country and you have to figure those additional costs into the equasion. also during period of serious economic downturns (such as during the nep disaster and more recently with the crash) younger people and families tend to move to bc where they tend to have family and where they are welcomed and opportunity is strong. it's an easy move. that helps keep unemployment in check during the 'boom bust' cycles and that has a huge role. alberta has never appreciated what a huge roll bc plays in their prosperity. 

and that's before we even get into issues like \"which companies would relocate because they would no longer have a head office in canada\", such as westjet etc. that's one for quebec too actually. 

when you get right down to it, the short answer is that alberta's economy is not diverse enough and the population is not high enough to be it's own country successfully over any extended period. 

in fact it would really take at least three provinces to make a go of it - alberta bc and sask. they could make it together as a new country. add manitoba and you step the chances up again. manitoba doesn't bring much to the table but it would give huge leverage as it has access to hudsons bay and it would mean that the new country would control most of the food production currently in 'canada'. which gives it some significant leverage. 

alberta isn't even close to being able to go it alone.",liberals

hhl0r1a,2021-10-21T14:44:57.000-07:00,"'stirring up sentiment': trudeau pours cold water on kenney’s equalization vote 1. i disagree. we're looking for constitutional change. we can come up with whatever we want, but as the prime minister himself pointed out, it's not just up to us. so any formula has to be developed at the negotiating table. we needed an open ended mandate with force, and this is a far better way to generate one than to come up with something out our asses and hope everyone else likes it.

2. there are open questions all over, as to whether the clarity act will come into force and whether the referendum itself can trigger talks. the other part of the issue is if you ignore it you might just boil things to the point where people start asking questions that are undoubtedly the purview of the clarity act. and as i spelled out in my other post, i think québec will see the opening that alberta has made and be the lever necessary to progress to talks. he's already said that québec wants them. alberta gives them, quasi-constitutional democratic ammunition and an ally.

3. the matter is only just being opened. we have not yet seen exactly what power the referendum will offer kenney. and if all it gives is popular discontent, guess what, that works for a lot of albertans. 47% of us want out, 4% more is no biggie.

4. i see what you're saying, but there's a vast credibility gulf between east and west. and just saying, no one cares what the west thinks is the mentality that has us in this problem in the first place.

5. for a lot of us this has already become a change or leave scenario. it isn't about kenney, it's about us. he didn't force anything on us, we want this. and i think a lot of us are ready to get dirty. i hate the canada that is, i have no patriotic impulse towards a bunch of two face self absorbed easterners. you think so little of us and so much of this shitty country destroying it would give many of us no end in pleasure. cutting of the nose to spite the face would be a great place for us to be.",liberals

a real change would be to our labour laws banning temp agencies and limiting contract work for employees. if you are an employee as the law views it and you are not self employed employers should not be able to pretend you are a contract worker or use temp agencies to eliminate your rights. this would force employers to hire proper full time employees and provide benefits. that said i feel for people working in low income jobs whose families are not covered for dental, medicine or optical. i think kids are already covered so maybe minimum wage earners can receive that as well.

traditional progressive conservatives believed in the principle of unintended consequences. they'd hear the call for social justice for marginalized groups, but they want to delay change as a precaution. while martin luther king rightly pointed out \"justice delayed is justice denied\", the progressive conservative would worry about the backlash from social change that is too fast for some to keep up, even if the delay is unjust. they would also argue that government policies and social changes have unintended consequences, so it's better to move slowly. the authoritarian wants to cancel all of this as soon as possible because their core principle is that there are shall we say, lions and sheep, and the lions deserve to eat the sheep.",conservatives

 i see on personalfinancecanada so often people saying \"i might move to alberta, it makes so much sense financially, but i don't want to live around conservatives and their ideals\"... these people have no pang of irony creep in. no thought process that *maybe conservative places have more opportunity because they're conservative.* maybe conservatives just do some things better, like run an economy without massive red tape and regulation? but nope, these people think there is nothing that conservatives do correctly and they're just evil, while the left is always moral and correct. it's a complete lack of world knowledge that gets someone into that mindset.

i also think there are some parts of culture that are worth conserving. the family unit, gender norms, cultural norms (thou shall not steal, dont cheat on your spouse)... conservativism is something that people arrived at by looking and studying history and seeing what works the best. obviously we need social programs and some regulation so you dont end up in a dystopian hellhole where 1 company owns everything and pays people like slaves. but there are many norms the left wingers are throwing out the window at their own peril. also, massive immigration is another thing they ignore at our peril. when you import the third world too fast, you will become the third world.  sweden and parts of europe know what that means. i am also pro-freedom and it seems increasingly that the left laughs at \"freedumb\" and would spit on the grave of ww2 soldiers. they value safety over liberty, they deserve neither.",conservatives

second he'd have to prove that was the intent of the schools and they'd be dead in the water there for the most part. the intent was assimilation. they wanted to absorb the first nations into the 'proper' english culture that every civilized person must aspire to achieve (in their minds). 

third - they dumped it on the church and there would have to be some proof that it was reasonable to assume the church would mistreat people. 

fourth you can't take human rights models of today and just drop them back 150 years. there's a lot of problems with that. 

and there's other issues. 

now there's a real case to be made the gov't should have watched over everything better. and in fact the courts have already talked about that, and there are reparations as a result. and that's true. you can't just turn a blind eye and say \"well we didn't know\" - you should have been checking. you should have reviewed living conditions and nutrition. etc etc. they did not. and in that darkness horrors were committed. so that's on the gov't.

his heart seems to be in the right place (if you care about people and community) but he is in the evolution camp rather than the revolution camp.

he has done a few good things

he has put a lot of resources into indigenous issues...he addressed some of the historical issues; even issued an apology

he has addressed gender and diversity topics.  appointed a lot of diverse ministers etc. 

he has improved the canadian image world-wide.  

he has increased immigration a bit and brought in more refugees

he has made some improvements in pension plans, pushed for wage increases, reduce poverty, homelessness etc.

he was gonna create a more fair tax system and take out some major tax dodge loop-holes.  but as soon as the wealthy class rattled the cage he backed down...still a little better than before.  there is some improvement in the funding of cra, but thats about it.  

he is pushing climate policy pretty hard, but once again when push comes to shove he always takes the middle road.  he dropped a few pipelines but ended up buying the biggest one to keep the peace.

on covid he set an example early on by quarantining very early in the pandemic.  but he did not push the provinces very hard.  if we had locked down before the march break we could've prevented a lot but oh well.  same on vaccines.  he got the vaccine supply but did not push the provinces on it.  same on vaccine passport.  he pushed the provinces to do their own thing but did not create a federal one that provinces could just sign on to.

if your referring to hydro that was ran into the ground long before the liberals took leadership. today parties just kicked the can down the road because it cost a fortune to fix. turns out ignoring things because they cost money today means it cost more tomorrow. 

hydro was fix it or sell it. selling it was the cheaper option and people still lost their minds. ford also said he would fix hydro but has yet to do anything meaningful. 

if your talking housing that is an entirely different subject that this isn’t the place for but i do agree it needs attention.
