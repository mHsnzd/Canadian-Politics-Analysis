absolutely.  acknowledged in other replies.

&gt; and these vaccines are purchased by the federal government using money paid from canadian's tax dollars. we have a right to know the details in them.

sure, in the bigger picture, i'd be very open to insisting on better transparency in contracts between governments and private companies.  i think in many cases governments do have the stronger negotiating position than the companies they are engaging and could make it clear that a public contract is going to be a cost of doing business.

seems to me that canada could at least approach the suppliers to try negotiate some kind of release of a redacted copy of the contract.  that just seems like an extremely low risk approach.

the per dose is interesting because it implies we pay for it as it goes into the arm so the pharmaceutical companies technically own it during shipping...it wouldn't surprise me if the entire logistics system is set up in the contract (where phizer is technically accepting a sole source contract for shipping from the canadian government as a condition of sale)...this might include negotiated charge out rates for military vehicles and planes.  charge out rates always look high and i can see why the government doesn't want this out line item by line item.  depending on the detail they may have also included shipping routes in the contract (i hope not) but publishing that data could be a security risk.

now there are also aspects of the contract the pharmaceutical companies might have negotiated for the non disclosure...the penalties for missing the shipment for instance (the lowest negotiated penalty sets the price for others to expedite).  there is also how spoilage and breakage is handled.

there is a pile of stuff in a good procurement contract and lots of it is very easy to make something look wrong.  \"why does the contract state that the cooler temperatures should be verified every 6 hours?\"  it's a loaded question because continuous checking would be better (but impractical) but is also redundant because they are brand new and we should assume they worked (does the government not have faith in the coolers they bought to work?).",conservatives
gre3fit,2021-03-18T04:19:01.000-07:00,"conservatives, while still obsessed with cutting taxes and balancing budgets, must put a price on carbon oil exports are very interesting in this context.  the conservative approach to carbon pricing (which has been generally adopted by the lpc) is that oil is a \"consumer pays\" problem, where the carbon tax is assessed at the point of use (combustion).  that's what gives us the domestic fuel levy, for example.

in this framework, exporting oil (or the us importing oil) is no major problem, except for the carbon intensity of oil-sands operations by themselves.  but since those are already addressed under a domestic carbon price, they should be free for export/import under a unified carbon pricing regime.

the progressive approach is a bit splintered, but overall it tends to push costs onto the producer.  consumers should be able to do whatever they want with their home heating or automobiles, but then the producers should pay the levy for the carbon emissions eventually created by the fuel.  this framework would make border adjustments more difficult, since fossil fuel transport would have an inherent and unmitigatable carbon cost.

&gt; canada does not enjoy the same luxuries, and basically has to go along with whatever the usa is willing to stomach.

i'm not too worried about industrial leakage to the us precisely because we have such a history of bilateral deals.  carbon border adjustments would be more useful under the wto framework, and in particular they'd be a stealthy way to force trade (in goods) with china/india to act as if if there was a universal carbon price.",conservatives

in canada, due to our electoral system and how dense our population centres are, the cpc will find it increasingly hard to win enough seats to form government unless they moderate and run back to the centre in an effort to win back those suburban voters. this played out clearly with the lpc's sweep of the gta and most of ottawa, montreal, vancouver, etc in 2019. they even grew their margins in many of these seats despite losing the popular vote.",conservatives

first, notice the use of the word \"may\" in the title.  such weasel words are used by media to avoid getting sued for lying.

.

&gt;desmarais, whose companies employ 48,000 in quebec, **thinks** trudeau wants him to leave organizational structures in the province intact, [...]


.

&gt;canadian pacific chairman ian sinclair, who is the country's most influential businessman and who has also contacted trudeau for guidance, tells me he didn't get a pull-out signal but got no encouragement to hang in,

.


&gt; [trudeau] agreed that investors should not take any precipitate action either to pull out of or invest in quebec, but rather should adopt a waiting stance while making clear to the new government that they wish assurances about their future in the province.



so we have one ambassador who says one business man thinks trudeau might want him to pull out of quebec, and another business man who said trudeau specifically *didn't* tell him to pull out


and we have trudeau giving sound advice to international businesses in the face of a quebec seperation

gmldsqp,2021-02-08T00:14:05.000-08:00,"let's talk immigration. this is the exact reason why we're never going to acquire a strong enough base of youth voters. the benefits of immigration largely outweigh the negatives. 

&gt;to remove publicly funded catholic schools, which are constitutionally entrenched since 1867, all because of non-christian immigrants, is the epitome of diversity and inclusivity policies eroding our heritage.

take a history lesson. the majority of settlers in north canada were protestants, to begin with. catholicism is not our heritage. furthermore, we should be separating church and state, so there's no reason for us to be funding special schools that are misrepresenting the bible anyways. 

&gt;people may adapt english, and, or french, as their home language, but they're not being born into the official languages. that's a problem.

why is that a problem? you do not need to be a native english or french speaker to effectively speak either language. our immigration policy specifically operates on a system that requires our immigrants to speak either language. in addition, we've specifically put in education systems to help these immigrants improve their language even more once they arrive. 

&gt;of course, the bureaucrats in ottawa will present you graphics and papers of how immigration is addressing labour needs, but they’ll never say anything as to whether or not immigration is helping increase the value of our incomes, and the value our wealth.

first, anyone with a decent understanding of basic economics knows that the canadian dollar being higher than the us is because of the us's fall in 2008. don't forget, there were still tons of immigrants coming in during this time, so to scapegoat immigrants is pathetic. furthermore, the contribution to our gdp and labour needs is massive. maybe immigration doesn't have direct ties with the overall growth of our individual incomes, but they also don't cause any negative effects that outweigh our growth in gdp, so you're argument is irrelevant. 

&gt;this problem is compounded when population growth is entirely driven by immigration. proposed solutions to change our standards to accommodate those in the developing world does not help, and in fact, it betrays canadians who are educated in canada. 

who does the income inequality effect? immigrants. these immigrants prefer income inequality as opposed to the original countries they lived in, which is why they moved here. you can't say that income inequality is a reason why we shouldn't be having immigrants when they still prefer these circumstances to the circumstances they escaped. still, we should actively be trying to alleviate this inequality, and that in no way whatsoever betrays canadians. saying so is just a desperate attempt to be oppressed. outcomes are going to be unequal. they're supposed to be unequal. that's how capitalism works. that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to accommodate for equal opportunity. 

&gt;why are we celebrating one race for the entirety of february?

because we've completely erased black history from our curriculums to glorify white colonization. simply talking about a few black slaves here and there is not indicative of black history, and so if you want black history month to be removed, actively seek legislation on a provincial level that adequately addresses black history in our schools. 

&gt;i'm also a visible minority myself, but we never get any of these special loans, scholarships, programs, or our own month, clearly, this affirmative action in of itself is arbitrary, and entirely driven by political narratives.

i agree that these special loans are a little out of place. 

i voted for harper 3 times and scheer last election. i've been a dedicated fiscal conservative for most of my life. but let me tell you, the reason why youth voters are straying further and further away from the conservative party is because of sentiments like these. immigrants are not the problem. we have much bigger issues to address, and villanizing a huge portion of our voting base is not going to help us get those issues resolved.",conservatives

this is a common misconception. the best way to measure how easy it is to overdose on a drug is the ratio of the median effective dose to the lethal dose. the lower that ratio is, the easier it is to overdose on that substance. for alcohol, that number is around 10:1, for cocaine, it's closer to 20:1 (for comparison, heroin is around ghb have ratios closer to 5:1).

&gt;cocaine also is short lived in effect, alcohol takes hours to metabolize, and so the practical effects of cocaine mean that using a fairly large amount in one session can be easier to do

this is actually backwards. the fact that it takes longer to metabolize and gradually builds up in the bloodstream makes alcohol far easier to overdose on. to overdose on cocaine, one would have to do incredibly high amount of the drug all at once, on purpose, to the point where it would be tough to accomplish by accident (as the cocaine will leave one's system very quickly). with alcohol, on the other hand, one can drink at a steady rate and just get drunker and drunker until the overdose is achieved.

&gt;of course if you want to quantify harms for political reasons, you will be picking and choosing what your politicians focus on, often neglecting additional harms of alcohol like duis where cocaine and driving isn't nearly as tied with a high crash rate.

this is a good point, as in addition to the direct harms of overdose associated with alcohol, it's also one of the very worst drugs for a developing fetus, is one of the most associated with crime and violence, and severely reduces one's motor skills while also raising one's confidence (which is why you see so many drunk driving accidents). long-term, alcohol is associated with more diseases and conditions than either heroin or cocaine, including a whole host of cancers, liver cirrhosis, ischemic stroke, heart disaese, and many more.

[here's](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar_url?url=https://files.transtutors.com/cdn/uploadassignments/1509030_1_article-1-seminar.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=8vuxyohef4-emwh4q5zgbq&amp;scisig=aagbfm38kad64jtb-mxd9pc3ckgkm6a3za&amp;nossl=1&amp;oi=scholarr) a good paper on the relative harms of various drugs, which shows alcohol one of the most destructive by a fair margin. on their hundred point scale, alcohol was number 1 with a score of 72. heroin was at 55, crack at 54, and powder cocaine at a mere 27. ecstasy was a 9. not to mention the fact that many of the harms associated with illicit drugs are exacerbated by prohibition (lack of safe supply/quality control, engagement with black markets, raised prices that fuel petty crime, etc.)

[here's](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-toxicity-of-recreational-drugs) another article with a chart comparing drug lethality, which shows cocaine as 50% less lethal than alcohol, heroin as twice as lethal, and many other recreational drugs listed as well. when one really looks into it, it quickly becomes extremely clear that the actual relative dangers of drugs has zero correlation with how actually dangerous they are.",liberals

&gt;finally, the government would have the function of relieving misery and distress. our humanitarian sentiments demand that some provision should be made for those who “draw blanks in the lottery of life”. our world has become too complicated and intertwined, and we have become too sensitive, to leave this function entirely to private charity or local responsibility. **it is essential**, however, that the performance of this function involve the minimum of interference with the market. **there is justification for subsidizing people because they are poor, whether they are farmers or city-dwellers, young or old. there is no justification for subsidizing farmers as farmers rather than because they are poor.** there is justification in trying to achieve a minimum income for all; there is no justification for setting a minimum wage and thereby increasing the number of people without income; there is no justification for trying to achieve a minimum consumption of bread separately, meat separately, and so on.

in short, assistance to the vulnerable, low income and people that need it makes sense, but specified assistance for one group of employees simply because they're having a hard time doesn't. it leads to a system where the entitled believe they deserve assistance but other people don't. many oil workers love it when the government helps them when they're down, but complain any time low income people get subsidized.",liberals

honestly, saying that is easy. if you were in the seat to actually trade someone else's life for some nice words i have serious doubts that you would do so.

like, as pm would you stand and face the micheals family and be all \"hey sorry you're husband/fathers had to die and all, but i really wanted to say some things\"?

if we were talking about a statement tied to a multilateral campaign of nations to pressure china for their release then that would be something worth pursuing, but we're not. we're talking about some words without action.

&gt;also no one is saying it should be unbacked by meaningful action except the liberals who are incapable of taking any.

first, if the writer of the motion doesn't include calls for action outside of the words, then they are specifically choosing to put forward the motion unbacked by action. the government doesn't edit these things. it's pretty absurd to accuse the government of not including x in a motion they didn't even write.

second, it doesnt matter what should or could or would. the motion is what it is, which is words unbacked by action. the motion could include calls for various real world consequences, but it doesn't. i'll speak to what is being proposed and voted on, and comment based on that, not what i wish it was.

&gt;do you think staying silent and refusing to take action because of pressure gives the right message to other governments?

we aren't silent. everybody outside government leaders talks about genocide in china. as far as expression goes, we're actually in a good position for people to criticise china as our government isn't responsible for the statements of private citizens. 

&gt;what do you think about the fact that members of the prime minister's own caucus agree that he is making the wrong choice here?

i think that roles into the previous statement, where the government isn't responsible for statements from party members, opposition members, or the public. parties can and do boot members for statements, but those statements don't speak for the government/party/etc. in canada we have the freedom that allows for people to go on camera and say china is committing genocide, and the government can rightfully say to china that it's simply a fact of our institutions.",liberals

this is a valid concern, and the problem is that full legalization of such \"hard drugs\" has never happened before, so it's an unknown.

what is known however, is that many current users of these drugs are typically introduced to them (or forced on them) through their existing interaction with the criminal/black market for other reasons (\"softer\" drugs, gangs, sex trade, etc). other users get into harder drugs because they were prescribed legal painkillers, became addicted, then needed their fix once they couldn't use their prescription anymore - a fix the criminal black market is more than willing to provide.

at the end of the day, i'd find it hard to believe that people would willingly try meth/fentanyl just because it's available to legally purchase. i doubt a group of young adults looking for a fun weekend would decide that buying a bunch of meth is a good idea.

if legalization of harder drugs were to happen, the most important aspect would be to eliminate profit from the market. absolutely no person or company should be looking to get more people hooked on hard drugs in order to line their pockets (looking at you, big pharma).",liberals

you cannot prepare for a specific pathogen, but you can make sure you have the capability of both developing vaccines when they happen and make sure you have the capacity to manufacture the vaccines. the fact is that both canada and the us, along with several other developed nations, have basically outsourced much of the research and much of the manufacturing capacity. that's not trudeau's fault, and blaming him for what is a multigenerational failing on the part of governments in canada and elsewhere is absurd.

i'd like to think that many of the wealthier nations would take lessons from this, that  significant investments in pathogen research and in vaccine manufacturing needed to be repatriated. yes, it's going to cost billions, and yes it's going to mean many of those facilities produce more mundane vaccines, maybe for decades at a stretch, but if more nations had manufacturing capacity right now, the whole world would be much further ahead.

but you know what's going to happen; the government's, and indeed the entire nation's resolve, will fade within two or three years of the end of the pandemic. they will find ways to justify cutting back funding, selling off facilities for a quick buck in asset firesales, and in a decade or so, we'll be right back where we were in january 2020.",liberals

&gt;tue, jul 19, 2016, 3:15 pm
	
&gt;to me

&gt;mr. [redacted]

 
&gt;dear mr. [redacted]:

 
&gt;the office of prime minister justin trudeau forwarded to me on april 7, 2016, your email concerning the situation of human rights in the kingdom of saudi arabia and the sale of light armoured vehicles (lavs) manufactured in canada to that country. i regret the delay in replying to you.

 
&gt;the promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of canada’s foreign policy. canada stands up for human rights and takes principled positions on important issues to promote freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. canada supports a stable and prosperous middle east, governed by freedom, tolerance and pluralism, where human rights are respected.

 
&gt;of course, canada remains concerned about the human rights situation in saudi arabia. canadian officials at the embassy of canada to saudi arabia engage regularly with saudi officials, including the saudi human rights commission, to maintain an open, respectful and constructive dialogue on human rights issues. canada’s engagement with saudi arabia on these issues extends into multilateral forums as well. for example, during saudi arabia’s universal periodic review at the united nations human rights council in october 2013, canada noted the increased participation of women in saudi arabian society, including the important role they have assumed within the shura council. i also welcomed the local municipal elections in saudi arabia in december 2015, in which women voted and a number of women were elected.

 
&gt;i take every opportunity to raise these issues and will continue to do so. on may 23 and 24, 2016, during my visit to saudi arabia, i raised critical issues with senior saudi officials with respect to human rights as well as humanitarian issues. i met with several senior saudi officials including the king, the crown prince, the ministers for education and energy, the minister of state for foreign affairs, and the president of the saudi human rights commission, who reports directly to the king. i also met with prominent women in politics, media, business and homemakers and had valuable exchanges on the evolving situation of women in saudi arabia. our discussions centered on the importance of women’s rights and gender equality, two key canadian values. further, canadian officials raise canada’s concerns about human rights with senior saudi officials on a regular basis and will continue to do so, both publicly and in diplomatic discussions.


&gt;with regard to the sale of lavs to saudi arabia, canada has sold lavs to that country since the 1990s and has no information to suggest that these lavs have ever been used against the saudi population. furthermore, an export of this type requires an export permit. canada has some of the strongest export controls for military and strategic goods in the world. however, in light of concerns raised, canada is introducing more rigour and transparency to its export control system. canada is also delivering on its commitment to accede to the united nations arms trade treaty on a priority basis. i am pleased to have tabled the treaty in parliament on june 17, 2016, which is a first formal step in this process.


&gt;you may wish to read the statement i issued on april 13, 2016, regarding the sale of lavs to saudi arabia, at http://www.news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1051599.


&gt;please be assured that the government of canada will continue to monitor the human rights situation in saudi arabia and encourage the saudi government to respect its international human rights obligations.


&gt;thank you for writing.


&gt;sincerely,


&gt;the honourable stéphane dion, p.c., m.p.

&gt;minister of foreign affairs


&gt;




to which i replied:

&gt;thank you mr. dion, i appreciate your response.

&gt;i do not request or require any further reply, but i ask that you and the government reflect on this:

&gt;it may be that the items sold to saudia arabia were not used to oppress the people living there, but that isn't really the point.  what i call into question is not the practice of selling arms to oppressors, but doing any business with oppressors at all.

&gt;we should stop doing business entirely with saudia arabia until their government can learn to behave properly.  if the loss of the sale means i have to pay higher income tax, so be it. i will sleep a lot more easily at night.

&gt;regards,

&gt;[redacted]",liberals

you watch, the policy convention is going to be a trainwreck. the socons are emboldened, and honestly, they don't really care whether the cpc ever forms a government again, since i suspect a fair chunk of them are probably western separatists who dream of an independent west, or of joining the states (though trump's defeat probably has cooled the jets on that plan).

the cpc is a thin layer of political party over a roiling mass of hysterical discontent. they scare the hell out of urban canada, and even in some parts of the urban prairies some voters are getting pretty distressed over what the conservatives have evolved in to, and if there are problems in edmonton, just imagine what southern ontario and vancouver and vancouver island voters must be thinking.

ever since scheer's meltdown conservative commentators have been trying to argue that there's a path for the moderates and the socons to share the same party, but i think there's a poison in the tory base that will only be cured by giving up 5-10% of their western base, and basically make the cpc so uncomfortable for socons, western separatists and all the other hard right factions that they do pick up and leave.",conservatives

gnxn66n,2021-02-18T05:33:46.000-08:00,"almost half of canadians want to eliminate the governor general position: poll the governor general serves key  constitutional functions which protect the rights of citizens. let me give you an example.

we once had a prime minister who attempted to prevent a transfer of power :[sir charles tupper](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_tupper#prime_minister,_may%e2%80%93july_1896). tupper won the popular vote in 1896, but wilfred laurier and the liberals won a much larger proportion of seats in the house of commons as a result of the first past the post system and the liberals winning key regions. tupper refused to follow  convention and resign as pm. westminster parliamentary convention dictates that  laurier, whose party was now clearly the largest in parliament, be allowed to form government and become prime minister.

after refusing to resign, tupper tried to make appointments and orders in council. lord aberdeen, the governor general, simply refused to give them royal assent. this effectively brought government to a halt. tupper's party also couldn't pass legislation, since laurier controlled the house. eventually tupper resigned, and laurier and his party were invited to form government.

so we have had the constitutional mechanism to deal with a pm who refuses to transfer power since the country was founded.  the 1896 incident showed it works. it is found in articles 9, 10 and 11 of the constitution act, 1867:

&gt;__declaration of executive power in the queen__

&gt;_9. the executive government and authority of and over canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the queen._

&gt;**application of provisions referring to governor general**

&gt;_10. the provisions of this act referring to the governor general extend and apply to the governor general for the time being of canada, or other the chief executive officer or administrator for the time being carrying on the government of canada on behalf and in the name of the queen, by whatever title he is designated._

&gt;__constitution of privy council for canada__

&gt;*11. there shall be a council to aid and advise in the government of canada, to be styled the queen’s privy council for canada; and the persons who are to be members of that council shall be from time to time chosen and summoned by the governor general and sworn in as privy councillors, and members thereof may be from time to time removed by the governor general.*

executive power ultimately rests with the queen, which flows through the governor general, who is \"advised\" by the pm, and cabinet (privy council). 99.99% of the time the governor general rubber stamps anything the government advises. if the government forgets they rule for the people though, then the monarchy is the institution, ***through the gg***, that acts as the final guardian of our constitutional rights. it   ensures government officials  rule according to the constitution and convention. they remind the prime minister they serve at   her majesty's pleasure, and are there to serve the people.

safe and reliable access to pure and untainted supply is what we need, which is not what decriminalization can provide, since that only allows for simple possession to be legally ok - which is sort of already is because it’s generally not enforced.

you should be able to walk in to a drug store, ask for a gram of bayer cocaine, or whatever, and they ring you up at the register, giving you the drug info insert with responsible use, addiction center contacts, and all that. this would hit drug dealers where decriminalizing would simply add an additional veil of protection for low quantity possession.

first, please pay more attention to what i wrote. i said i am *concerned* about the potential for an increase in violence if all drugs are legalized. there is no *presumption* here, but i *suspect* it will.  

it is not clear to me what point you are trying to make. 

because you, like me, cannot prove that legalization will or will not do it. perhaps you are skeptical about this, thats fine, but there is no way it can be proved either way. so is this what you are trying to get at? 

then, your previous comment, i took to mean you were unaware that hard drug users commit violent crimes.  this is an astonishing position to take, as hard drugs, plural, often mixed with alcohol, is a major cause of violent crime.  you dont seem to be aware of that, or your skeptical because you think prisoners who self-report to the government about their drug use is somehow reliable. 

you keep bringing up alcohol, which i take to mean you are trying to suggest if alcohol is legal and it too causes a lot of violent crime, why not just legalize fentanyl and crack?  if this is your position, just come and say it, and thats fine, but you are in a substantial minority, virtually non-existent. 

so im curious what point you are trying to get at? 

and by the way, violent crime isn't my only concern with legalization, its just the most immediate concern.  even ignoring that canada would be infiltrated with even *more* organized crime - just exporting, rather than importing - and we would become a form of pariah state, what non-violent concerns do you think in also concerned about?",liberals

having a \"regal\" head of state who has few day to day powers, but in moments of crisis, has the reserve powers at their disposal as a means of a governmental circuit breaker, are to my minds, a critical part of why our system works as well as it does. with a governor general, who for the vast majority of their time does little more than pin medals on lapels, still able to, when, for instance, an election delivers an undecided result and where a pm or premier does not want to vacate the office (that has actually happened once in canadian history, when sir charles tupper refused to concede to laurier's liberals despite losing the election), the vice-regal representative is the final authority on the matter. and because our governor generals and lieutenant-governors are not political actors, and because they have sole discretion over invoking the reserve powers, something like the nonsense that happened last november in the us is inconceivable here.  the governor general, among other things, is the acting commander-in-chief (in the name of the queen), he could conceivably in such a situation even order the canadian armed forces to remove a prime minister who refused to concede.

if there's one thing that's missing from canadian's westminster variant, it's the weekly meetings a pm has with the queen. if we were to appoint more ggs like david johnston, it might be useful for pms to discuss matters of policy with a non-partisan figure who is technically their boss.",liberals

**\"new study shows trudeau has fulfilled 92% of promises in full or in part - best record of any pm in 35 years.\"**

&gt; at the heart of the 237-page publication — **the product of work from two dozen canadian academics** — is an analysis of 353 liberal pre-election promises and an evaluation of how many have actually been fulfilled since trudeau’s team took office.

the budget can only handle so much at once, so i think that's why they didn't do pharmacare. maybe they could have, if the pandemic (and its huge expenses) hadn't happened.

i think they were correct on electoral reform too... the other parties wouldn't agree on what reform to do. and doing it the wrong way would open-up fissures in canadian society, especially with how diverse and spread-out canada is. 

and the fissures concern turned out correct, as we later saw what happened in the us. plus, if we had proportional representation and the ppc gets even 7% of seats (some polls have them even higher), that's 24 seats for them, and they could do a lot of damage. ranked ballot is a better system, but it might help the liberals, so they can't implement that without being accused of helping themselves.

that sounds like they are restoring orphan wells to operation, not decommissioning them. that’s not improving climate change at all. it’s just kicking the can down the road for when the public will have to pay another hefty price to actually clean up the wells once they are abandoned for good. and why should the public have to foot the bill for this? why, when the government is picking winners and losers, are they picking fossil fuel companies as the winners here? if these companies can’t claim up their own mess and still produce a profit then clearly the industry isn’t designed to operate with a profit motive. 

we actually don’t know to what extent the fossil fuel sectors interests materialized, because there’s a lot of legislation that isn’t even being proposed due to the economic power and government relationships the industry has. the fact the government felt it was appropriate to keep this relationship a secret is most troubling, as it implies a sense of trust the government has in the industry.",liberals

and, of course, as the other commenters below point out, harper's refusal to touch the file in any way may have been enough to quell some fears, but it still did a disservice to the availability of choices folks can make in this scenario, as nothing was done to make the process of getting an abortion safer and easier to access (here or abroad), nor was there an increase in services and supports for new parents who chose not to abort. without these, your government is still not 100% pro choice in its actions.",conservatives

raises are indexed to inflation to automatically hit in $500 increments. it has been that way since 2008, save for one year (2015) when harper raised it to $10k. trudeau immediately returned it to the pre-2015 rates (which was $5500 at that point). it hit $6000 in 2019 as part of the original rules.

full disclosure, i tend to follow an academic foreign policy theory of liberalism (not to be confused with liberalism in domestic politics, they are different despite having the same name). in this theory, the best way to keep nations at peace is by creating more interdependence between countries.

for example, germany and france have fought for centuries, but the eu basically made it so they are both so economically, politically, and socially dependent on each other that war can't happen between them barring a major change. this interdependence also allows each country to have a say in the other country because they need each other.

this is what needs to happen with saudi arabia. if saudi arabia starts to get economically, socially, and politically on countries that are against escalation of the war in yemen, they will begin deescalating. this doesn't happen when you pull out everything from the country and leave them on their own. if we abandon saudi arabia now, they will see the west as unreliable and side with china. this will make the situation in yemen worse not better because china does not give a shit about yemen.",liberals

gnew6dx,2021-02-13T23:05:15.000-08:00,"the black conservatives hoping to bring people of colour into the tory tent yes! to all of this. i think you expressed my thoughts better than i did (maybe because i wrote this early in the morning). 

like i mentioned in another comment. i think blm did bring an important conversation about police brutality and how they treat black people, but i think they are mostly full of it especially here in canada. i think they want attention and distract from the real issues facing black people. the whole defund the police bullshit and all cops are bad bs is where they really left me. i think they are really out of touch with the black community. i am convinced none of them grew up in the rough areas toronto. 

in terms of why the black community doesn’t flourish like others. i think it’s a number of reasons but i will list two. first one being the lack of development in black areas. i grew up in the west of the city (keele and eglinton) and the area is largely neglected til this day. i wish the city and all levels of government invested in these areas so people can get acccess to better resources. 

another reason being lack of community: when you look at other races in particular other minorities they have strong communities that work together and help each other. there are strong black communities don’t get me wrong, but the gangs in toronto are too prevalent. they initiate black youth when they are really young. i grew up during the crips vs bloods era and it was scary af. my mom was very strict with me, always had to be home right after school, put me in sports and activities, etc. this ensure the i didn’t get involved with any of the crap. i hated the her for being strict but i can see why she did it.  

there are other reasons like divorce, cultural differences. etc i can basically discuss this all day. essentially black issues in canada are not the same as black issues in the us. i wish politicians and other people would realize this. the quicker they do, the quicker black people can prosper.",conservatives

gknlv52,2021-01-24T08:45:01.000-08:00,"liberals bury canada's energy superpower hopes &gt;my examples were hydrogen, manufactured gasoline.

you solution is to add unnecessary inefficiencies to make an artificial product nature does better than humans? why?

&gt;also, it might become the case that energy needs to be gathered (and stored) closer to the end users more than gathered in selected regions of the world and then transported 'half way' round the world to end users as it tends to be today.

that's not how electricity works though, you build your generation as close as possible to the point of consumption to limit losses. this is the ultimate failing of the so-called renewable export market, anyone we could sell power to can generate it more efficiently and do it locally. look at how energy is traded now, those locations with an excess of energy (call it hydro, oilsands, whatever) sell it to the regions with less or no energy supply for profit. renewable energy by definition is available to everyone regardless of their physical location and subject to varying degrees of effectiveness. all things being equal canada would be a net consumer of renewable energy given the superiority of others generating capabilities.

&gt;that will create business opportunities to design, build and operate those facilities. who better to do that than people who already have extensive experience in working with energy facilities.

all of this will done locally. will these be opportunities in canada? sure, we can fill in some of the generation gap but this is not a exportable commodity.

&gt;if i look around on the interweb, i'm confident i can find a chart or graph or table that shows that renewables are displacing fossil fuels, certainly that coal is losing market share.

i would like to see this chart you're referring to, can you share it?

&gt;it seems that i could also find a chart or graph or table that shows that canada has exported record volumes of crude oil (during a pandemic) and other similar indicators that nothing is really changing. if there really is going to be a transition, we are surely still in the early days.

you mean like [this](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-commodities/crude-oil-petroleum-products/statistics/crude-oil-summary/crude-oil-annual-export-summary-2019.html) or [this](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/oil-exports)? you made the claim that the rest of the world has moved on and i don't see that anywhere in the data. explain.

&gt;it will be decades before we can look back and say \"yes, a transition did occur, and it clearly began in this year and was largely complete in this other year.\" it will also be decades before we can look back and say 2020 would have been the ideal time for canada to jump on this or that trend.

not even remotely correct, we gather statistics in near real time and if you have the appropriate subscriptions you can demonstrate trends lagging a month or two. show me this trend you claim exists.

&gt;i can even allow that there is a chance that all of this will 'blow over' and that the kxl project will rise from the grave and actually get built and that production from the oil sands will double. it just doesn't seem that this is the most likely outcome, and so maybe canada should start making some plans that leverage the skills and abilities that today's energy workers do have.

to what end? your suggested alternatives here have very narrow growth potential. there really isn't anything to swing into, its more than likely we are going to ride out the momentum of our energy wealth and end up a poorer nation when its all said and done similar to central african nations re: rubber.

&gt;and what is your stance here. is climate change a thing, or more of a hoax, or other?

climate change is not within canada's control and we benefit from it long term, all this effort to undermine our economy to influence a phenomenon we can't get our hands around is a wasted effort. we should be looking to monetize our wealth in the post-change world, maximizing the sale of our energy resources, our water resources and our food resources.

&gt;are ghg emissions a concern, or not really much of a problem at all, or other?

ghg fears is a bunch of handwaving to distract from the fundamental causes of climate change, namely that we don't need 7 billion humans to survive as a species.

&gt;fifty years from now will energy production and consumption patterns be surprisingly similar to today, or very different, or other? i'm interested.

the only paradigm shift i see is nuclear driven, even with quantum batteries we will struggle to achieve the energy density available in chemical fuels. nations with low population density and/or large land mass will sell their resources for profit to those nations driving climate change as their ability to supply their own people dwindles.",liberals
