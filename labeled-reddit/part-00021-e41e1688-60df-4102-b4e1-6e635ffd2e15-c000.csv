gyq1d8m,2021-05-19T03:49:05.000-07:00,"liberals play delicate balancing act in response to escalating violence in israel and palestine excerpts that are false:

“jewish citizens live as though the entire area were a single space (including the gaza strip).”  all israeli citizens are afforded this ability.

“israel accords palestinians a different package of rights in every one of these units - all of which are inferior to the rights afforded to jewish citizens.” this is also false, israeli citizens are afforded the same rights, regardless of ethnicity.

“the gaza strip is home to about two million palestinians, also denied political rights. in 2005, israel withdrew its forces from the gaza strip, dismantled the settlements it built there and abdicated any responsibility for the fate of the palestinian population. after the hamas takeover in 2007, israel imposed a blockade on the gaza strip that is still in place. throughout all of these years, israel has continued to control nearly every aspect of life in gaza from outside.”

this is also false. israel completely pulled out of gaza, leaving it be governed by itself. they even exhumed the graves of the israeli dead. the palestinians had their first election in gaza and elected hamas, who’s charter called for the destruction of israel. only *after* hamas launched rockets at israel, was a blockade enforced. in an attempt the stop the terrorism.

“palestinians living in other countries cannot immigrate to the area between the mediterranean sea and the jordan river, even if they, their parents or their grandparents were born and lived there.”
this is also false. replace “palestinians” with everyone in the entire world. it’s not exclusive to palestinians, the same restriction applies to canadians or americans as well.

the immigration laws in israel are an attempt to create a safe space for jews. jews are victims of the most hate crimes (per capita) in the western world. 3x as many hate crimes against jews than blacks in canada (per capita). so open immigration for jews, is to escape persecution from the entire world. applying it to mean palestinian apartheid is some pretty ridiculous mental gymnastics.

people don't like to remember when they were wrong so i understand why people have conveniently forgotten the early response or say things like \"it was an evolving situation.\" sorry but the literature showed that border restrictions work, masks work against sars viruses and we should assume this is an airborne virus like sars and mers. the world was preparing for a global pandemic caused by a sars-like coronavirus specifically, it's not like we can look at things in a revisionist manner and act like we did the best we could with the information at hand.",liberals

this is because travellers from hotspots can go through 3rd party countries to get around such restrictions.  but in going through 3rd party countries means they could spread the disease to more countries.  also it can make it harder for the government to recognize people who could be potential carriers for the disease.

so there is a big difference in effectiveness between general travel restrictions and only having restrictions between hotspots. 

also not sure how feasible closing all borders down would be politically at the very beginning of the pandemic.  it would have been pretty unpopular at the very beginning, which can be a big problem for a minority government.  plus this would include the us-canadian border which was the hardest to close due to requiring negotiations for economic and political reasons.",liberals

first: looks like the leger poll wasn't as big an outlier as predicted. maybe the ndp are breaking through (like in 2015) in northern alberta. it is possible - they were popular there before, and readers should remember this part of alberta never voted wildrose (except for fort mcmurray). there's a different culture once you're past red deer, and the old wild rose party's version of laissez-faire corporate capitalism didn't sell in that area until it got packaged up in the ucp.

second: looks like the ndp lead is there, and could as big as shown. while this poll shows a shallower lead than leger's, any poll which gives the alberta liberals that much support is just appetizing for the ndp. those voters are willing and able to vote ndp, and in all likelihood, won't have a choice otherwise as the alp is a gravestone, not a party.

third: independence is dead. they came, we saw, and we didn't like it. they'll still likely poll better than the liberals, again, in 2023, but the pandemic is just the latest thing they fail at. people going back to the ucp in southern alberta is a bit of a surprise, but would also be a pleasant one for kenney, who might now have some leverage over the most rebellious part of his caucus, if not for the fact the ndp apparently lead him there by 10.

&gt; as the news sunk in, o’toole wore the look of someone who has been waiting for something he just realizes isn’t going to arrive. in his case, it may be his shot at being prime minister. trudeau, by contrast, looked like a man adrift who has just spotted a safe harbour

i thought his was a good line that had me vividly picturing both men.

edit:

&gt; that plan relies on him presenting himself as plausible — a prospect not helped by a new video that emerged on wednesday. o’toole is pictured smirking outside the office of the prime minister in ottawa, saying that he had found more appropriate office space for trudeau. the camera then pans around to a porta potty that has somehow found its way on to wellington street, accompanied by sniggers from the leader and the cameraman. judging by the weather, it was shot some time ago. nevertheless, it presents o’toole as an unserious person at a time when he desperately needs to appear dependable.

goq35xo,2021-02-25T01:01:36.000-08:00,"ndp calls out liberals for voting to kill mp’s pharmacare bill &gt;quebec's already pulled the trigger. it's been a success.

most of english canada doesn't pay attention to french canada though, or they assume that the price of quebec's services is quebec's significantly higher tax rates. it becomes \"one of those things quebec does.\" see also: quebec's childcare system.

&gt;but the way we ended up with our national medicare program was as a federal initiative

this isn't true. medicare began in the provinces - specifically saskatchewan. by the time the federal government starting working towards the canada health transfer in the mid-60s, there were only two provinces (ontario and... bc, i think?) who weren't at the table or well on their way to coming around to it. the canada health act was the end point of a bottom-up process, not the starting point of a top-down one.

&gt;saying that pharmacare needs to be a provincial initiative

it needs to be a provincial initiative because in the end - federal cash or not - the provinces will be on the hook for regulating and delivering it, because its their jurisdiction constitutionally. if the federal government puts in funding and pulls much of it back at a later date (like they did with medicare), it will still be the provinces on the hook for running the system. there is no unilateral federal solution to this problem.

&gt;and i see no reason why inaction by a federal party which has promised action for decades, with the power to deliver, should be acceptable because action could also be taken provincially.

i'm not saying it should be. it's a perfectly reasonable thing to push for action from both orders of government at once - in fact it makes sense to do so. but bill c-213 wasn't what that looks like, from a federal parliamentary perspective - at least not if you're serious about trying to get somewhere.

so - assuming provinces are being pushed by their own voters, assuming there's provincial buy-in to the *idea* of pharmacare but a lack of political will to commit dollars without ottawa at the table, what might an opposition party do federally to light a fire under the government to try and get results, other than the bill c-213 approach? well, quite simply, they could try being parliamentarians, instead of back-seat cabinet ministers: 

instead of creating a symbolic law that's just an empty shell that the gov't is free to ignore forever or repeal/amend once whoever's in has a majority next, get cross-bench buy-in to actually bring pharmacare to the forefront of the parliamentary agenda. that could involve doing stuff like:

* order a parliamentary committee study on the progress made to-date in implementing the hoskins report recommendations. give the committee power to demand all relevant documents and compel witnesses, and don't hold back on the questioning. make the media care.
* use the committee's report as fuel to pass a motion in the house setting a target date for the full implementation of pharmacare (or at least for the negotiation of an agreement), and then oblige the government to bring forward regular updates on the progress of negotiations. 
* if progress isn't being made in spite of all that, or if the government is dodging the issue, then **be prepared to threaten to bring down the government and force an election over this singular topic.**

pharmacare isn't off the agenda for the current government, but it's one priority out of something like 250. force it to become *the* priority. that's parliament's role, and what an effective opposition can do. there would even be buy-in from liberal backbenchers who want to see this promise delivered.",liberals

[plain language summary here](https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/cb/2021/38663-38781-39116-eng.aspx)



ok, so this is officially, legally not a tax.

 &gt;the majority noted that the term “carbon tax” is often used to describe the pricing of carbon emissions. however, they said this has nothing to do with the concept of taxation, as understood in the constitutional context. as such, they also concluded that the fuel and excess emission charges imposed by the act were constitutionally valid regulatory charges and not taxes. 

implications of that are interesting.  the liberals job killing carbon tax is practically trademarked.  the signs for this election have already been printed.  


all in all this is a big deal. probably didn't need to waste the time on it in court, but it does settle a lot of arguing.  all eyes on the cpc who need to come up with a feasible, serious climate plan while running on getting rid of the carbon *pricing*.  meanwhile, trudeau takes a victory lap.

 i have no doubt there is a vocal anti-immigration group (eg the yellow vest protests from a few years ago now). i haven't seen anything that suggests they are a large enough voting block to swing any election,  in my opinion are more likely to alienate other voters that see them as unhinged xenophobes.

the ndp are far more likely to support the lower class laborers. the conservatives were the ones that expanded the temporary worker program allowing low skilled people to work, driving down  domestic labor prices. but the people who are anti immigration because jobs are not going to vote ndp in significant numbers, they will vote conservative anyways.",conservatives

what do you mean villanized? i am an under 45 worker and haven't felt that. as for immigration, if the money spent on immigration were used instead to promote canadians raising families, then i'd support lower immigration. my real wage has been going down because wages haven't increased. i am in high demand right now and wages have increased $3/hr in my 15 years at it. meanwhile charge out rates have significantly increased by $30-$40/hr in that time, so it isnt taxes suppressing my wage. 

i would vote conservative if they did the following:
-get rid of social conservatives
-stop reducing worker rights
-eliminate the tfw program (way worse than immigration because wages are spent in their home countries). this has been a huge wage suppressant. 
-automate everything that can be within the government to reduce govt spending

translation: i am sick and tired of academics using social science to explain the way negative ideas spread and wish to instead crucify those people for the positions that they learned from their parents and trusted adults when they were very young and impressionable. 

conservative media has worked hard to utterly discredit information coming from any source other than the church and themselves. they characterize as news organizations that give alternative views 'partisan' media which is in fact just reporting on actual events.

'personal responsibility' is a dumb position to hold, and it is the position of the conservative party. you have to recognize that within a echo chamber there is little room for dissent, and within conservative communities they do the best they can to separate or inoculate communities as much as possible from foreign spread. the shift in georgia happened because democrats recognized this and mobilized mostly poc to break people out of that echo chamber and deliver the state to biden for the first time in a very long time. 

you have every right to be angry about people trying to take away the rights of american voters. but in my opinion you should also listen to the social science and use that science to your advantage in spreading your own ideas. don't let anger stand in the way of progress. joe biden understands, partisanism is what republicans want. they want to paint democrats as tyrants aiming to take away the freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. don't give them any extra ammunition.

because tva is a network that has a large media presence (exclusively) in quebec. tva is well within the mainstream of quebec's society, so its media coverage can be taken as broadly representative.

moreover, you can also read the title of this story as saying that the impugned headline was _in_ quebec, precisely because the story did not air outside of the province.  \"trudeau fights negative alberta headlines\" would make sense as a hypothetical sausage-making story from federal politics, despite \"alberta\" not being a media company.",liberals

you take alberta and sk out of that graph of rest of canada and you will note that provinces without the carbon tax reduced their use of pretroleum products more than bc.   people in bc propably like this rest of canada graph because it allows them to pretend they've done something - they haven't.  they are not reducing as much as other provinces that didn't enact the carbon tax until trudeau forced it.   

then for your support you use a graph that does not compare bc to ontario, it compares to rest of canada, and we already know and i already admitted that alberta and sk ain't reducing they are increasing accounting for most of the country's increases.   so find yourself a comparison with ontario that reduced more, without the tax while bc increased.  and i remind you that bc didn't reduce anything, the federal offices in charge of carbon tax use the official data and it shows there is no reduction in bc.  the data i provided a link to is what is used at international discussions on climate change.   

regulations followed up by enforcement is how to actually make a difference.  a carbon tax is there as a surface level feel good story that does nothing.   you know what would make a difference, if each province adjusted their building codes just a little; if a province decide that no new suburb can be built with a gas line into it and they have the be electric or alternative heat - and if that electricity came exclusive from hydro or nuclear.  that is what it takes.  not taxing people who heat their homes with the way they were built because the province allowed them to built that way - stop allowing new homes to be hooked up to fossil fuels.",liberals

but this budget is inarguably a step backwards on pharmacare, compared to 2019.

the 2019 budget talked about a national formulary of drugs, which would list the drugs to be covered under pharmacare. that's gone from this budget.

the 2019 budget promised to create a canada drug agency to oversee the development and implementation of pharmacare. that's gone from this budget.

the 2019 budget promised 4 years of funding to a \"transition office\" within health canada, to oversee the creation of the canada drug agency. that funding is cut off in this budget.

the 2019 budget outlined the \"core principles\" pharmacare would adhere to. that's gone from this budget.

hell, this budget doesn't even mention the hoskins' report, which the 2019 budget said was guiding them.

the one thing this budget keeps is the money the government had pledged to help cover the costs of the most expensive medications for incredibly rare diseases. and while that's a *good* thing. it's not the \"foundational element of pharmacare\" this budget tries to claim it as. the 2019 budget explicitly listed the three foundational elements of pharmacare as creating the canada drug agency, developing a national formulary and investing in information data systems. the government did none of those things since 2019, and isn't even giving them lip service here. and the hoskins' report made it pretty clear that the rare disease strategy wasn't really part of the steps needed for pharmacare -- it's a separate program.

to be clear, i think the 2019 budget's pharmacare section sucked. the fact that it didn't give money or timelines on the key steps we'd need to take to create pharmacare made it seem like a plan designed to lead nowhere, to me. and the unnecessary steps (4 years to create a \"transition office\" to consult on the canada drug agency's vision?) reinforced the impression they were in no hurry. but *at least* it mentioned what the steps we'd need to take were. the 2021 budget doesn't even do that.

i agree with you on one thing, though. programs \"don't magically appear\". that's why it's important there actually be a plan. unfortunately, instead of taking the 2019 budget and adding the funding and timelines needed to turn it into a plan -- this budget scrapped it. and, now, the only way we'll get pharmacare from this budget is if actually can come into being by magic.",liberals

we made this bed. it's not like we didn't know that china was a brutal dictatorship unwilling to compromise on pretty well anything. we might want to ask ourselves what the realpolitik value was of having such a large chinese population immigrating here when, as it turns out, they are unable or unwilling to protect the country. maybe we shouldn't have allowed the chinese police to process the immigration applications in what was probably the *stupidest thing the canadian government has ever done*.

we are at the mercy of china. if we don't care about the principles involved, we should learn to live with the new situation and stop whining about it. lube up and spread those cheeks. 

or alternatively, if we don't care about the money involved, we should adopt a policy (gasp!) and declare independence from china. close down the cpc organizations in the country. find different markets and suppliers. become more like taiwan. hey, maybe we could even do things like support taiwan, the dissenters in hong kong, the uighurs and so on.",liberals

77.4% of people paying any capital gains tax have individual earnings over $150k. increasing the capital gains inclusion rate would mainly apply to those people. this would be the top 3.5% of earners, and i’m not sure the top 3.5% of canadians are middle class. the capital gains inclusion rate also isn’t where “most revenue comes from” and increasing it by 25% wouldn’t change that.

if you’re on a lower income it would make more sense to max your tfsa than your rrsp, but you also probably not in a position to invest a whole lot more than your maxed tfsa. there’s no reason to pay capital gains tax if you don’t have to.

&gt; moreover, the top one per cent’s 2015 share of total income, 11.2 per cent, was still 0.9 points below its peak of 12.1 per cent in 2006, following 13 years of liberal rule.

now a lot this i attribute to the late minister of finance: hon. jim flaherty as opposed to harper, but i deeply respect harper's decision to appoint such a competent and skilled finance minister. the one thing i did dislike however was income splitting (splitting income between spouses for lower overall taxes), a policy flaherty blocked for years that harper implemented after his passing, i strongly disagreed with that move. 

finally the harper government spearheaded the modern democratization of finance in canada with the revolutionary tfsa (tax free savings account) which empowered retail investors.

longer version:

&amp;#x200b;

we could also see why we're getting less allocation (again as a % of population) than every other industrialized nation. apparently even asking that question is a big no-no among the liberal party faithful.

criticisms of their handling include their behaviour up to now. we have obviously had much lower allocation as a % of population than others. maybe it's because we're not the economic powerhouse like romania (4%) or lithuania (3.9%)?

[https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

check the daily doses per 100 people half way down if you really want to see evidence the federal government is an abject failure in this. i very much hope i have to eat crow in this by march, but with each passing week it's becoming more and more clear that trudeau is absolutely absent and has no ideas. obviously something is working in other locations, so why are we getting the absolute shaft here? 

we signed a lot of contracts without delivery timing (or at least not so far as anyone can tell). they delayed approval of any new vaccine production in canada, and while it might be speculative, it's quite suspicious that the 2 approved are in liberal areas or battlegrounds and the ones denied are not. 

we had a 2 week head start on europe and should have had a lead at that point, but since we got to 1% vaccination at the start of the european campaign, we have since progressed to 2.6, while most european countries have gone to 3 - 5%. (not including uk or us)

which, as you might point out, is in the past and doesn't help now. this is still a failure of epic proportions however you want to proceed.

now, they could allocate more resources to vaccine approvals, and prioritize based on those firms that could commit dosage earlier. there's no benefit to spending the same time to approve a maker that can only supply 100,000 doses by september where they could approve or investigate one that could supply 10,000,000. they've been literally sitting on the az approval for weeks now, j&amp;j is getting approved in other locations and we haven't heard anything about canada.",liberals

gumqqwx,2021-04-15T04:08:25.000-07:00,"conservatives' climate plan would replace liberal carbon tax with lower one of their own now i'm see what happened: o'toole listened to mark jaccard (architect of the bc carbon tax), who's been arguing for years that flexible regulations are far more politically palatable than a carbon tax, while still being reasonably cost-effective.

the cpc plan has three ideas: (1) keep track of how much each individual has paid in carbon tax and return it as a green rebate; (2) cap the carbon price at $50/t; (3) use flexible regulations to hit the 2030 target. (2) and (3) are straight out of jaccard's recommendations; the proposed flexible regulations in the cpc plan are modelled after bc's.

the cpc hired navius research (which i think is associated with jaccard or his students?) to prepare an analysis of their plan.

https://twitter.com/andrew_leach/status/1382719686987554819

as a climate voter, i'm really happy to see this.

  - according to experts like jaccard, both parties have a realistic plan to hit the 2030 target.

  - the advantage of the liberal plan is that it's way simpler. keeping track of how much each person pays in carbon tax, and deciding what constitutes \"green\" spending, is going to be complicated and expensive. in a low-trust political world, i think simplicity is going to be a big advantage.

  - the liberal plan is also able to adopt jaccard's flexible regulations *as well as* the higher carbon price. so that gives canada more room to cut faster if needed.

  - o'toole will need to battle his own party to get them to accept the plan; maybe he'll be able to point to polls showing a bump with liberal/conservative swing voters.",conservatives

* as the virus mutates, it *may* acquire immunity escape. so far this is not the quite the case. while the b.1.351 (sa) variant has shown signs of potential escape, indications are that both mrna vaccines (pfizer, moderna) still offer good protection against it and all indications are that it would be straightforward to adapt them in the form of a booster shot targeted at a voc (variant of concern) that could, for example, be geographically targeted for distribution.
*  we do not yet know how long the immunity from the vaccines will last against covid-19 and it's variants. some vaccines provide lifelong immunity, others require periodic booster shots and as for the flu virus it is to address a different strain each year. there are however encouraging signs that immunity provided by the covid-19 vaccines appears to be broader, stronger and longer lasting than against actual infections. for how long is still very much tbd.

this being said, the more covid infections there are, the more the virus gets a chance to luck out on a genetic variant that would be dangerous.  that is one that would:

* escape partially or completely the immune system protection from vaccines (or prior infection)
* be more contagious
* be more lethal (note that more contagious is actually often worse in terms of overall fatalities)

this is not something that anybody knows yet. it may only last a year, but it may provide several years or decades of protection.

&gt; as the virus mutates, there will be vaccine escapees (covid variants the vaccine does not cover). this will re introduce infection.

sure, but generally those mutations are weaker. it's possible that this coronavirus will mutate into something like the existing coronaviruses that give people a few colds every year.

&gt; in my opinion vaccination on it's own is not a viable exit strategy to covid.

conservatives are led by economics / capitalism so they will push an agenda that allows those on its side to make money tomorrow. the system they are establishing is not designed to plan ahead and care for the public it is designed to make themselves, private interests, rich - tomorrow and divert power from the public democratic system into the hands of the unaccountable private. if that means vaccines today then it will push vaccines. public turmoil and fear is not only ignored its fuelled because it just further helps them achieve their goals. playing dumb and ignoring expert opinion is part of that strategy. thinking calm and rationally, using expert / professional opinion is not helpful to make money. thinking in the moment and with panic and fear makes them more money.

the public ignoring this and blindly pushing it along through ignorance is definitely not helpful to say the least.

as far as a the larger political picture is concerned conservative thinking is really important together with liberal thinking - and **there should be even more parties that are all equally viable and balanced**. we need to work together and integrate diverse perspectives in order to address these issues and move forward. canada prides itself on being an open society that allows people of all different backgrounds and perspectives now we need to actually start doing that and utilizing it to help us. if we don't then the future will not be very bright for canadians / humans. there is no excuse for canada, a country with unprecedented natural resources and a highly functioning democracy.",conservatives

the situation with meng is not that simple, but i can see you like simple explanations that fit with your black-and-white worldview where the world is neatly divided into good guys and bad guys, like a hollywood action movie.  the us did \"not do everything legally\" if their head of state made incriminating comments that he intends to meng as a bargaining chip.  that's on record.  that he's a buffoon and says things he shouldn't doesn't change the comment.  the extradition is now before the court.  i don't want to speculate but it sounds like the feds are sitting back and hoping a judge tosses the extradition request on the basis of how it has been politicized, which would let both canada and china save face: we get to say that we allowed the independent process to follow its course, the chinese get to save face by highlighting how this was a politicized hack job by the americans and their cause was vindicated.  

if the extradition request is allowed, i don't know what the feds are going to do, and extraditions are not my area of law, but keep in mind that discretion is built into our system and the minister of justice has discretion to stay cases where in their discretion it is not in the public interest.  i don't know if they're going to do that.

the reality is that we have a government that is trying to engage with a messy and complicated world, even if the results take a long time to materialize and are likely anti-climactic, and an opposition party that wants to bang the table but doesn't have much of a plan beyond the sugar rush of doing that and being \"right\".",conservatives

a brief diagonal reading of the paper (i'm in no way an expert except for being a parent) the issue seem to be more the educational program of the cpe than about (publicness) of the program.

it's true that kids cpes are very structured and  have a very interventional tendancy with kids interactions. they will teach kids to verbally express themselves, negotiate and to never resort to violence to resolve conflicts. which works great in a highly structured environment like the cpe. the problem (maybe) is when the situation at home or at the playground is more chaotic those technic won't work thus the kid is confuse and loses faith in what the institution teaches. [edit] boys being more aggressive in nature might have a harder time to adjust

we've already talked about the conservative climate plan when o'toole released it in april. he seems to be fighting his own party over it.

the conservatives are promising generous temporary funding for businesses to encourage more jobs: a canada jobs surge plan to pay 50% of the cost of new hires, a 5% tax credit on any capital investment in 2022 or 2023, a 25% tax credit on up to $100,000 invested in a small business, a $200,000 loan (up to 25% forgivable) to businesses in tourism/hospitality/travel, a gst holiday for a month (for retailers), and a 50% rebate for dining out for a month (for restaurants). that last proposal sounds similar to something the boris johnson government did.

the conservative plan includes doubling the canada workers benefit (an existing wage supplement for low-wage workers), which seems like a good idea.

the pbo hasn't estimated the costs for the platform yet.

finally, to cool the housing market, the conservatives are promising a two-year ban on foreign investment in real estate. in bc, there's already been a lot of measures put in place in recent years to increase scrutiny and taxation of foreign investment in real estate; i'm curious how people here will feel about an outright ban.",conservatives

gw9cppx,2021-04-28T14:12:30.000-07:00,"‘pathetic’: greens blast trudeau’s climate commitments &gt; i think you're reading some weird information about a rebate.

to be more precise, andrew leach (architect of the alberta ccir that the federal obps is based on) describes it as a **subsidy**. we can think of a firm as making two transactions: it pays a carbon tax based on the full amount of its actual emissions, and it receives a subsidy **based on the sector average, not its individual emissions** - cutting its emissions does not decrease its subsidy. the actual mechanics of payment (the subsidy is subtracted from the balance owing) is immaterial. in terms of incentives, the key point is that the firm's incentive to cut its emissions per unit of output is based on the full carbon price, whether its emission intensity is above or below the sector average. every t co2 which it can cut is worth $40, not $4.

in terms of incentives, this is very similar to the household-level federal carbon tax. dividing up the revenue equally and returning it directly to households doesn't change the incentives of each individual household to find ways to cut emissions that are worth less to them than the full value of the carbon price. even when 100% of the carbon tax revenue is returned to households, the incentive for an individual household to cut their emissions is based on the full carbon price, not zero. similarly, even when 90% of the carbon tax revenue from a sector is returned to firms in that sector, the incentive for each individual firm to cut its emissions is based on the full carbon price, not 10% of the carbon price.

[vox's explanation](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/10/24/18017726/canada-trudeau-election-carbon-tax-dividends) of obps for a general audience, from 2018:

&gt; eite industries are high-emitting industries that are exposed to intense international competition (think oil sands, petrochemicals, and pulp/paper). because of their emissions, they are particularly vulnerable to a carbon price — and if it drives them out of business, international competitors simply pick up the slack. emissions get moved offshore, not reduced.
&gt; 
&gt; so canada would exempt eite industries from the fuel charge (a.k.a. the tax). instead, they would participate in these obps. canada’s ecofiscal commission has a [good explainer](https://ecofiscal.ca/2017/05/24/explaining-output-based-allocations-obas/) on output-based allocations (obas), but the basic idea is pretty simple.
&gt; 
&gt; emitters in a particular sector are allocated credits based on their carbon output — or rather, based on the average carbon output of a facility in their sector. this average is the performance standard for the sector.
&gt; 
&gt; poor performers, which fall beneath their sector’s performance standard, will have to buy more credits. top performers, who beat the performance standard, have extra credits to sell. none of the money leaves the sector — it just circulates from worse to better performers. in this way, the sector as a whole is protected from a carbon price, but the incentive to reduce carbon emissions is retained. pretty clever!",liberals
gw9dnn4,2021-04-28T14:22:27.000-07:00,"covid-19 vaccine certificates ‘to be expected’ as part of pandemic, trudeau says i really don't think you would be able to justify this inter-provincially. if the vaccines work as well as they seem to, and the number of cases drops to really low numbers, and stays there, and almost no one goes to hospital for it, because the vast majority are vaccinated, there's no need for this kind of record for provincial travel. you can't override mobility rights with the notwithstanding clause, so the only way to abridge them is to justify it to the courts under section 1.

ianal, but in a non-pandemic, non-emergency situation, with no threat of health-system collapse, i just can't see this being justifiable before the courts. 

i think the difference between this and 9/11, is that this is the whole world against a time-bounded non-human threat, rather than one country fighting against a group of people potentially indefinitely. it's a very different outlook. most people are onboard with doing what we need to do to beat the virus, for now, so we can go back to normal; there's strong agreement on this in the population. given that the vaccines are in reach (and in arms for 30% of us!), i think people are just putting up with the draconian measures until we get everyone vaccinated.

now that we're moving out of the third wave, and people are getting vaccinated, i can see calls to lift mitigation measures massively increasing. if the vaccines work as they should, then there'll be no reason to keep the heavier measures (curfews, travel restrictions, business closures, family and close friends social distancing), and, the lighter ones, eventually (masks, generalized social distancing).

if, however, the vaccines don't perform as well as advertised, and draconian measures do begin to stretch past the date where we get everyone fully vaccinated, i think we, as a society, should have a discussion about what kind of public health measures are acceptable on an ongoing basis. this is when i think the discussion you rightly point out that we're all avoiding is going to happen, if we get to that point. i don't think anyone wants to live like this forever. 

so, yes, technically i'm \"totally okay\" with this. (not totally, but mostly). i'm willing to wait until vaccine-delivered herd immunity (which *hopefully* should be this summer), and give the government the benefit of the doubt until then; especially given that they're generally following the science, and the icus are really, *really* full. most of the people i talk to are of a similar mind.",liberals
