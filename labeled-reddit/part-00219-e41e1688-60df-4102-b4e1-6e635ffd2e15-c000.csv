h2enxia,2021-06-19T17:30:41.000-07:00,"health agency head in 'extraordinary situation' after opposition motion puts him in contempt of parliament &gt;that, given the undisputed privileges of parliament under canada’s constitution, including the absolute power to require the government to produce uncensored documents when requested, and given the reality that the government has violated the rights of parliament by invoking the canada evidence act to censor documents before producing them, the house urgently requires access to the following documents in their original and uncensored form:

&gt;**[insert extensive list of documents including secret department of national defense documents]**

&gt;accordingly the house hereby orders that these documents be produced in their original and uncensored form forthwith.

wanna guess which current party leader voted in favour of a motion with that text in 2009?

by gee, it was justin trudeau! he voted in favour of that motion when the harper government was illegally preventing parliament from seeing unredacted version of secret wartime documents.

parliament has the right to view requested documents. trudeau voted for a motion that said as much in 2009, then cpc speaker peter milliken confirmed that right in 2009, and the lpc speaker confirmed that right now.

in your opinion, was justin trudeau and the liberals disgustingly playing games with secrets in 2009 when he demanded access to unredacted documents with secrets? or was he just fighting for his rights as a parliamentarian to hold the government accountable?

like, i don't really see where you're taking issue here. the opposition is just copying liberals playbook when it comes to illegally withheld documents.

shouldn't we except and demand that the government to act in a lawful manner?",liberals

&gt;(a) examine a temporary freeze on home purchases by non-resident foreign buyers who are squeezing canadians out of the housing market;

&gt;(b) replace the government's failed first-time home buyer incentive with meaningful action to help first-time homebuyers;

&gt;(c) strengthen law enforcement tools to halt money laundering;

&gt;(d) implement tax incentives focused on increasing the supply of purpose-built market rental housing units; and

&gt;(e) overhaul its housing policy to substantively increase housing supply.

hohvvj1,2021-12-13T18:39:37.000-08:00,"rethinking canada’s security strategy: how canada can graduate from the kids’ table few of these points are remotely meaningful, and i say this as someone who strongly disagrees with trudeau and the liberals generally (pharmacare, electoral reform, the nationalization of the failing and unprofitable pipeline, etc). going point by point 

1: theirs no reason not to open dialogue with a potential trade partner, especially when we see from trump, ev’s, and literally the entire history of u.s. canada relations that america does not care about us at all, in any way except as their puppet, no matter how much we suck up to them. 

2: as did the entire establishment of both counties and beyond. also, for this to be a meaningful strike against them, you would have to demonstrate a way in which canada was hurt by them getting this wrong. 

3: most canadians are deeply anti-trump, publicly supporting his opponent means nothing in terms of actual policy. this would be a valid point if they failed to stand up to him when he started acting like a u.s. president visa vis ev’s, but so far they’ve responded well enough by threatening tariffs well in advance of the bills passage, and leaving themselves room for plenty of escalation in the likely event that biden doesn’t get the message. 

4: same as with 1 really. no point in not trying to secure every advantage one can against the elephant. 

5: who cares?

6: this one i think does actually reflect badly on them. plenty of auxiliary troops who risked their lives to aid canada have essentially been abandoned in a region currently being filled with reprisal killings against this very group
