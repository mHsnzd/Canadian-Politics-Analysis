the ndp want to look like they're cooperative but also want to differentiate themselves. they don't want an agreement because they don't want to saddle themselves to the liberal government. they would stand to lose either by looking useless if the liberals under deliver, or by making it even harder for them to take any credit if the liberals do deliver.

the liberals meanwhile have the exact opposite incentives. they want to make sure that anything progressive that they do because of compromise looks like an initiative that they took on their own volition. they can't let the ndp take credit (rightly or wrongly) for moving the liberals on anything. and since they're still looking for a majority, they don't want to concede any potential future opportunities to try and get one.

frankly, we're extremely likely to see codified cooperation from the parties until the two major parties think they are structurally unlikely to be able to win a majority any time soon. when majorities start to look out of reach, the incentives shift for all the big parties. ie. this is happening because of the electoral system.",liberals

once people see the options in front of them on stage: ford, horwath, del duca (and schreiner, though he wont be perceived as a possibility for premier), i think things will start to shift around. i think horwath will seem like the best option for premier on stage to progressive voters, unless del duca surprises. imo the liberal numbers are at this point more just based off a vague idea of the liberal party (and probably influenced by federal liberal popularity) and they have the compounding negative factor of del duca being both unlikable *and* unknown but also when he is known he's known for bad associations with the previous liberal government.

i know people are generally negative about horwath and the ndp's chances, and it's true she hasn't broke through before and faces an uphill battle, but i'm more bullish about the ndp's position than i am the liberals (in particular also since the ndp have incumbency advantage in a bunch of ridings that the liberals will need to fight to take back in addition to winning seats elsewhere). that said, ontario is pathologically attached to the safe status quo and loves just voting for the destructive opc/lpc cycle, so we'll see.",liberals

education is the simple way to prevent having so many stupid people. *however*, those very same stupid people are the ones that choose to send their kids to catholic schools, or to home-school their kids. both of these things lead to more people that are incapable of seeing the big picture, because they're not exposed to alternate or conflicting world views, and can't learn how to form their own opinions.

&gt;***opposition leader erin o’toole did the same—although, funny thing, when he*** [***congratulated biden via tweet***](https://twitter.com/erinotoole/status/1325127145857933312)***, he didn’t specify what he was congratulating him*** ***for.*** ***and even then, he was thought too bold by hundreds of his followers, who berated him for endorsing the election results.***

i think it is foolish for the conservative party to throw their hat in with trumpism. it doesn't play as well in canada, and it's not like trump or anyone like him is a principled figure to emulate as a paragon. we should plainly acknowledge legitimate electoral victories, whether or not we like the winner or whether or not we even like democracy.

&gt;one of the first things stephen harper did as prime minister in the spring of 2006 was to write, by himself, [a statement](https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2006/03/statement-prime-minister-election-belarus.html) on the then-latest round of fraudulent elections in belarus. (part of his motive was to show foreign affairs the kind of language he wished they’d use in such statements.) harper must have known that even the clearest language in a communiqué from ottawa wouldn’t change facts on the ground in minsk. but it’s handy to tell the world, at crucial moments, where our priorities lie, or where we think they should: with institutions over incumbents, with protesters over a thuggishly imposed order, with people who hope over those who want to kill hope.

i have my problems with harper, but man was it something to have a politician who actually had his own thoughts and the skills to write them down. these two things which we might expect of anyone past puberty are almost non-existent in contemporary politicians. such is the decline of our elites over the past couple of centuries.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i also note that stephen harper, the chairman of the international democratic union, whose members include the u.s. republican party, has had nothing to say on twitter about the presidential election since it happened. i guess it’s easier when it’s about belarus.

cowardly, but predictable for a political figure. he's still waiting to see which way the wind blows in the world of conservative politics. if he remains non-committal and low-profile during the ascendancy of trumpism, maybe his career can once again flourish after trumpism blows away with the wind. no political party wants to be instructed on conservative politicking by a guy who has been tarred and feathered for opposing trumpism.

&gt;and yet, there's an amazing silence here in canadianconservative on yesterday's events.

perhaps the content simply isn't being allowed as too us-centric. i think that would be silly though, because us conservative politics are clearly having a big influence on canadian conservative politics right now.

i for one am quite shocked that there wasn't a wall of national guards or police or *somebody* ready to gas and blast anyone who got within thirty feet of the capitol building. surely the time to protect the building is when it is full of senators confirming a presidential election?

seeing those morons shuffling through that beautiful architecture and regal artwork without an ounce of respect for the institution in which they stood was chafing. the problem we have is with low-quality elites. replacing them with even lower-quality vermin such as these trump supporters should not be the goal of any right-wing party.

i would have actually been less offended by a well-armed and sophisticated attempted coup. at least then there would be some sign of intelligence and conviction. instead, we got a degenerate mob waltzing in, making fools of themselves and then waltzing right back out. i would be surprised if the republicans can win any election again for the next eight to twelve years after this embarrassing gong show.",conservatives

more importantly, o'toole's comments involve dehumanizing a vulnerable segment of the canadian population and playing politics with their healthcare to win votes.  that's sociopathic and wrong, and it's what authoritarian movements do - try to rally hatred against a vulnerable minority.  incarcerated inmates are not subhumans and exposure to a pandemic is not a form of sentencing in canada.",conservatives

*wipes sweat from brow* well i'm relieved, that clears things up. looking forward to when businesses can start refusing banking services, groceries etc. to people based on their political leanings.

&gt; i'm amazed conservatives are arguing this point when they litigated and won a case in the us that said christian bakers shouldn't have to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple, and now they're arguing that no, private companies shouldn't have control over their content. there's no consistency with these people, they just make it up as they go along.

so 2 things here:

1) the level of interference here is substantially different. bake your own cake versus create your own social media company, then your own phone operating system, then probably your own phone, then your own website hosting services. i think the issue here is the optics of companies colluding to shut down up and coming competitors. you know that twitter and facebook are thrilled that other major companies have stifled parlers growth.

however even in principle the argument made by the baker was that of their right to artistic expression - can you make an artist create something that they disagree with artistically. e.g. something nsfw for example. this isn't the same situation with google, apple and amazon with parler. anyways i think that these companies have the right to choose who they do business with.

2) you've lumped everyone's criticism as clamouring for government intervention, rather than a moral condemnation of apple, google and amazon who are working together to shut down what's essentially a small business that's competing with other large corporations such as twitter and amazon. you can say what they're doing is wrong without calling for government intervention. which can also be applied to the cake baking scenario as well.",conservatives

i do think it was unconscionable for canada to leave khadr in guantanamo. that harper played on the \"old stock christian vs cultural minorities\" card during the 2015 campaign, particularly with the barbaric hotline. that some conservative politicians have eagerly propped up trash anti-muslim media and commentary. that liberals have failed to take serious anti-hate initiatives. 

however, where the article loses me is with equating bill c-51, bill 21, and the drive to be harsh on terrorism as inherently anti-muslim. secularism is a universal value and has seen muslim majority countries as well as western countries adopt restrictions on  religious symbols long before 9/11 contemporary hatred of muslims became a thing. and countries cannot ever be soft on terrorism of any kind, we've seen what it leads to. 

politicians should be mindful of their behaviour and ensure that they're not stereotyping or scapegoating muslims in any way. but they also shouldn't promote a moratorium on important discussions such as the place &amp; limits of religion in our society and how to stamp out religious extremism. unfortunately, we're seeing a real abdication of leadership on this.",liberals

first, your understanding of the meaning of the word \"provision\" is wrong. a provision is a mechanism that is applied to subject matter. you're calling the subject matter itself a provision. that's as nonsensical as swapping a verb for a noun. a legal provision in this case would be something like statute, standing orders, or constitutional law. the content of the documents themselves is not a provision.

second, are you unaware of speaker milliken's major ruling in 2010 when the harper government refused the house's order for unredacted documents relating to the afghan detainee issue? here, it starts on page 81 of [*selected decisions of speaker milliken*](https://www.ourcommons.ca/content/misc/ebook/millikendecisions-e.pdf). the speaker cites a number of sources in finding that the government has no right to tell the house that it may not have certain unredacted documents. i already cited one. here's another from the same source (page 136):

&gt; by virtue of the preamble and section 18 of the constitution act, 1867, parliament has the ability to institute its own inquiries, to require the attendance  of  witnesses  and  to  order  the  production  of  documents,  rights which are fundamental to its proper functioning. these rights are as old as parliament itself.

from bourinot’s *parliamentary procedure and practice in the dominion of canada*, 4th edition:

&gt; the senate and house of commons have the right, inherent in them as legislative bodies, to summon and compel the attendance of all persons, within the limits of their jurisdiction, as witnesses, and to order them to bring with them such papers and records as may be required for the purpose of an inquiry.

(page 70)

&gt; but  it  must  be  remembered  that  under  all  circumstances  it  is  for  the  house  to  consider  whether  the  reasons  given  for  refusing  the  information  are  sufficient.  the  right  of  parliament  to  obtain  every  possible   information   on   public   questions   is   undoubted,   and   the   circumstances must be exceptional, and the reasons very cogent, when it cannot be at once laid before the houses.

(page 281)

&gt; consequently, there are frequent cases in which the ministers refuse information,  especially  at  some  delicate  stage  of  an  investigation  or  negotiation; and in such instances the house will always acquiesce when sufficient reasons are given for the refusal... **but it must be remembered that under all circumstances it is for the house to consider whether the reasons given for refusing the information are sufficient.**

&gt; the lifting of restrictions on travel and other activities will be dependent on the prevalence of the disease, not the number of people who have been vaccinated.

&gt; mass vaccinations should see covid levels fall but no-one knows how quickly

and

&gt; vaccination is not a passport to mobility

but i have a hard time believing that after mass vaccinations cases won't drop rather quickly. if nothing else, far fewer people are going to be tested because even if you're carrying, people without symptoms don't tend to bother getting tested.

i also don't think any politician has suggested vaccines will allow travel before the spread is reduced, and to me it seems obvious that they would not (though i can imagine some entitled fuckwits acting surprised and outraged at the airport, that would be their problem and not ours)

also this is from the article

&gt; early evidence from israel, which has vaccinated more of its population than anyone, suggests the pfizer vaccine slows transmission.

well that would seem to contradict your thesis.

&gt; trudeau’s comments that canadians need only “hang in there” until they are vaccinated will only cause pressure to build. good luck to him if infection levels remain stubbornly high after mass vaccinations and people who have been inoculated are told they can’t move freely.

the issue of electoral reform is and always will be an issue of trying to appease their base while also not wishing to add fuel to the flames of “trudeau the tyrant” narratives. so while the lpc base is ideologically opposed to fptp they have practically benefited enormously from it and our countries’ fundamental national identity has been shaped by the lpc’s success.

the lpc is the oldest party in canada ( federally and even generally depending on how you measure the olp and plq) it is the only federal party that dates back to confederation and is actually 6 years older than the country itself. it’s 136 years older than it’s closest competitor for power at the federal level (the cpc) and it’s a full century older than it’s next oldest competitor (the ndp). the lpc is also one of the most electorally successful political parties in the world in terms of both numbers of elections won and per capita votes received over time. 


it’s a bit like the new york yankees coming forward with a proposal to improve the rules of baseball. the best example would be standardized outfield dimensions, everyone agrees that it’s ridiculous it hasn’t happened already. but, there’s  not a single team that will accept a standard outfield dimensions proposed by the “bankees” and the yankees fans and ownership won’t accept a standardization that’s going to fundamentally destroy their chances of enjoying the same kind of success going forward.

so until there’s a second party getting on board with ranked choice, the cpc breaks up or the lpc wins on an explicit promise to implement ranked choice. i don’t see there being electoral reform. even if through some miracle the ndp or greens were to form a majority, they wouldn’t even implement er in their first 4 years because of the same rightwing cries of tyranny.",liberals

&gt; as planner and university of southern california faculty member murtaza baxamusa has written, \"regulatory hurdles are a bogeyman for the housing crunch\". evidence from his own city of san diego, where, downtown, “there is virtually no nimbyism, and development permitting is mostly by right,” yet “private developers are building fewer units than the zoning allows, and avoiding building affordable housing altogether, despite a tower of regulatory incentives.” more affordable housing is “being demolished than [being] built.\"


ridiculous, look at a [zoning map of san diego.](https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/ca/san-diego-county/maps?map=ca_sandiego&amp;x=0.5875&amp;y=0.5820833333333333&amp;zoom=0&amp;basemap=zoningisdata&amp;tab=themes&amp;ll=32.9244376908749,-116.691707671722) the city is overwhelmingly zoned exclusively for single-family housing. by default the housing market is heavily constrained, meaning that whatever slivers of town are dezoned are highly exclusive, therefore highly valuable, property. 

&gt; https://shelterforce.org/2017/12/11/affordable-housing-meets-free-market-fantasy/

this article strikes me as inane. it honestly claims that local government has zero control over cost of land? the same local government which dictates how much land is available (unless they're going to claim supply and demand doesn't exist) and can levy taxes on land? local government absolutely has control over the price of land as they control the availability of it. it says that housing prices in the bay area are rising because it is a high-demand area to live with high wages, but refuses to consider that *supply* of land may factor heavily into that? it's patently absurd. 

wherever you look, [increasing the supply](https://www.upjohn.org/research-highlights/new-apartment-buildings-low-income-areas-decrease-nearby-rents#:%7e:text=new%20apartment%20buildings%20in%20low%2dincome%20areas%20decrease%20nearby%20rents,-the%20image%20of&amp;text=previous%20research%20from%20mast%20showed,effect%20that%20opens%20more%20homes) of housing [lowers housing prices.](https://cityobservatory.org/building-more-housing-lowers-rents-for-everyone/) even adding more [luxury housing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-05/what-adding-luxury-housing-does-to-rents-elsewhere) leads to overall housing price drops, as wealthy people upgrade to new housing, and what was previously high-end housing depreciates in value and becomes accessible to more modest earners.

now certainly i'd concede that relying purely on market forces is imperfect, and building public housing to help alleviate pressure on housing markets is a good idea. the vienna model is a fascinating one and imo a worthy objective for progressives, however it is worth noting that they do not [deny supply and demand,](https://cityobservatory.org/housing-policy-lessons-from-vienna-part-i/) and vienna has both a very relaxed zoning model that permits building and development all over the place, and builds a lot of units every year to keep supply high and prices low, in addition to federal subsidies.

&gt; debunked above, but even if it were true, why would the feds do it any differently? why do you believe the federal government is some sort of panacea?

frankly it's something of a longshot since canadian politics are dominated by homeowners who'd likely reject any attempt at reigning in the price of their investments, municipal or federal. my hope is that the federal government may be less affected by local homeowner activists, unlike city councils who are overwhelmingly anchored to such groups, but honestly it's a bleak outlook either way until canadians by and large are willing to accept that affordable housing, and housing as a retirement nestegg, are incompatible.

&gt; japan has 12 different zones, and limits what can be built in each. it is not a free for all like you are pretending. https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dh7vgtxjlpe/ux-r6h_sygi/aaaaaaaaarg/nnquczqay5u/s1600/zonagejp.jpg

i didn't say it was a free-for-all. however only 12 zones is a *hell* of a lot less zoning than you'll find in most north american cities. secondly, japanese zoning is [not exclusive like our zoning is.](https://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html) instead of excluding anything not strictly zoned for an area, japanese zoning allows a maximum amount of alternative use in a zoned area. in canada, somewhere zoned for category 1 can only have cat 1 buildings, and a place zoned for category 2 can only have cat 2 buildings. in japan, places zoned for category 2 can have both cat 1 and 2 buildings, and so on. practically nowhere in japan is zoned exclusively for single-unit family dwellings like we have in canada, [all of japan is zoned for mixed-use](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sv5etxds_8m/ux-axbtuf2i/aaaaaaaaase/e6gs6ujr_8m/s1600/zonageinclusifj.jpg) with multi-family units, small shops, churches, etc, able to be legally built pretty much anywhere in the city. 

&gt; what is incentivising real estate speculation is the increased subsidies by the government. any time an investment has preferred tax treatment and discounted loans you will see a strong increase in such investments.

yes this is also a problem.


&gt; land isn't artificially scarce. it simply is scarce, particularly land where people want to live. you can densify a city, but you can't add more land generally (obviously some niche exceptions exist like creating man made islands).

it can be made artificially scarce, moreso than it would be otherwise. if i live in a city where 50% of the land is zoned exclusively for single-unit houses with parking and lot size minimums, the land is by default much more scarce. in that 50% of the city, instead of being able to build a quadplex or a low-rise apartment block on a plot of land that could hold multiple families (and maybe a small shop) you can only build a single unit that holds a single family. legally speaking, this means there is less available land to work with, making it more scarce, and elevating prices.

&gt; lol so now you are claiming the barrier is a good thing, that barriers are actually just \"encouragement\"?

yes, the overwhelming barrier of logging into a website and entering a series of 0's into income statement boxes, and clicking 'submit.' truly a punitive, herculean task our witless citizenry are incapable of performing, and that our hapless government can do nothing to assist with.

as i said above: plenty of room to debate what all that data means or how it should be interpreted, and people have (and should have) a lot of leeway as to how they act on that data in their own lives. but it is a true statement that the studies have occurred and the data exists, and there is little to no value in allowing people to lie and claim it hasn't been done.",conservatives

i can't speak much about that, so i'll defer to you. either way, 30 more vaccine candidates are incoming at some point this year. they'll be no shortage of vaccines pretty soon. for the record, i would prefer they waive the ips, i just don't know what that will imply later on. i want a middle ground solution however, where the companies don't get screwed. 

&gt;the american proposal could be so narrow that it has largely no affect other than playing good pr at home for the biden administration and a little good pr abroad for the headlines. i would like to be pleasantly surprised, but i won’t hold my breath.

i'm pointing out that politically, when it comes to federal issues, they are either wholly within the federal mandate, strongly tied to it, or it's a national issue. housing wasn't truly, from the perspective of voters, a national issue until recently.

i don't know how you sell as a platform plank building millions of homes, in 2015 without making it seem like you're not just catering to toronto.

the reason immigration isn't really the problem is because canada actually has a ton of housing. we've been building condo towers and housing developments at unprecedented rates for decades already. supply isn't the issue. even if it were, it would be smarter to improve regulation that limits building sfhs and encourages more apartment complexes that house a lot more people affordably.",liberals

ha61e2k,2021-08-24T00:48:18.000-07:00,"liberals will take aim at real-estate speculation, propose homebuyers’ ‘bill of rights’ in ambitious housing policy yes and no, all depends on the municipality and their pre-existing infrastructure. speaking in the context of ontario, the provincial government has their growth plan already in place which allocates growth across the province to various communities. here i will focus mostly on water and wastewater (www) infrastructure because that is generally the hardest and most costly to upgrade. development is a financial curse if it is not done in a long-term financially sustainable way.  


for example: a small town/hamlet of 1000 people may only have their www systems sized exactly for their current needs. if the feds come in and blanket demand a 10% increase in populated-based zoning everywhere across canada, this small town is in for a financial shock if they are forced to prematurely upgrade their www systems to accommodate the 100 new people (assuming they would even want to move there). putting guesstimate numbers to it, it might cost $2-5 million to do those facility upgrades and replace the existing underground pipes with bigger ones to the newly up-zoned land. 

so, is that additional cost put entirely onto the cost of the new homes? do existing residents partially foot the bill for the development? what about all the other services that now have to plan for an extra 10% of usage? fire, police, ems, etc. splitting the www cost on the new homes only (i.e. make growth pay for growth), that's $20,000-$50,000 instant additional home infrastructure construction cost per new resident. yes more supply, but not quite the idea of increasing affordability.

a municipal infrastructure &amp; finance rabbit hole is digging into the development charge background study of various ontario municipalities. it lays out in full details the total municipal cost of development and growth projections.

for municipalities that have planned for growth ***not*** in the densification of existing single family homes, having that growth come sooner is (generally) fantastic news. they have already spent the money sizing their in infrastructure to handle the growth on the outskirts of town and the sooner development comes, the sooner the municipality can pay off those committed infrastructure costs. having pipes in the ground not being used over long periods of time is a huge opportunity cost.  


if the plan is for forced densification of existing single family zoned lands, expect hellfire from municipalities if they are not given flexibility on where it goes. depending on the distance to the www plants, the cost of up-zoning a single street of 100 homes in a mid-sized city could be in the tens of millions of dollars if that street is farther away from the plants. up-zoning the street right beside the plants? might only be a million. devil is in the details of www system layouts and current capacity constraints. and then the politics comes into play in choosing between the different candidate streets with lowest up-zone cost.  


again then there is fire, police, and ems response times to consider. can the roads handle the additional traffic? does the transit system need a complete revamp now? are there schools nearby with the capacity to handle the new families? what about park space? the nimby argument isn't only about 'neighbourhood character', there are big questions about who pays for all of these increased municipal service requirements. 

historically speaking, ontario municipalities have not done a great job making growth pay for growth and instead making the general taxpayer foot the bill. people haven't forgotten that.",liberals

interesting to note the libs actually went up too, apperently at the expense of the ndp, but with the margins of error where they are that could just be a lttle short term fluctuation. 

i think o'toole has sucked up a lot of the undecided and easy pickings so to speak. i think now he's in the grind where they'll have to work to actually change people's minds and convince them he's a better choice. which he can do, but we probably won't see any massive shifts until the debates unless there's a major screw up or something with the libs. 

but he might still 'peg' a point or two over the next week. he still seems to be getting the majority of the positive attention right now. 

what often happens during this stage is people who might change say 'well.. i'm kinda liking him but i'm not ready to actually switch yet till i see more\", and then they won't make up their mind to change till the debates. so he could be winning a lot of people over but not having it show in the polls just yet.

homebuyer tax credit is really stupid. i bought my first house last year. thanks to that silly credit i got $750 added onto my tax refund eight months later. the promise of $750 eight months later doesn't do a single thing to help someone buy a home, it just provides a little reward to someone who managed to do so anyway. i'd much rather that money be spent actually helping people buy homes. which, is going to have to consist of actually building new homes and going after speculators (not or). measures to just give people money to buy houses, which is the tl;dr of the liberal housing strategy to date and the main essence of this \"new plan\", just makes the problem worse by adding the pool of money chasing the same constrained supply. so housing prices inflate further and we're right back to where we started.",liberals

a few of the better policies are written to be toothless:

* we will ban foreign ownership (but only *unproductive* (vacant) foreign ownership)
* we will tax house-flippers (but they can deduct refurbishments from this tax)
* stop excessive profits from corporate ownership (by undertaking a \"review\")

a few of these policies would increase money in the housing market (likely raising demand and prices):

* fhsa (first home savings account) - $40k for first home is tax free; tax money can go toward the bid.
* rent-to-own - allows a buyer to afford properties they couldn't otherwise, and incentivizes investors. depending on implementation renter might get screwed by contract.
* decrease mortgage insurance (allowing a higher purchase price and encouraging higher leverage)
* 6 month mortgage deferral rules (reduces risk of purchases near your price limit)

a few of the policies seem to have potential to increase supply or reduce prices:

* convert empty office space
* encourage multi-generational homes via tax-credits
* stop blind bidding
* home price history transparency
* incentivize municipalities to build homes and inclusively rezone

overall, it's the most comprehensive housing plan of the parties. the other parties offered 30 year mortgages (among some other better policies), which is guaranteed to raise prices. rent-to-own seems like the biggest wildcard, it can either be helpful for new buyers or horribly exploited.",liberals

why are progressive hand waving this away as if o'toole is removing cheap daycare and not introducing any alternatives? he isn't just completely removing cheap daycare and a lot of progressives are acting like he is. 

when he removes it he is also introducing a tax credit equivalent. 

i'm very well off so my accountants will be sure to find ways to utilize it to the most; this is a actually very great way to gatekeep it away from poorer people who may not be familiar with tax credits and/or are not able to utilize them because they don't use tax accountants or tax strategies. this way we also save money on the program because less people will use them and odds will be that only richer folk will use them. does a single mother of two really have time to look up tax strategies and make time with accountants to figure it all out? and make sure she fills out the forms correctly? it's possible but the odds are not likely. it's a very good way to save some money.
