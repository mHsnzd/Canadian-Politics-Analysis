how about we pay people $2000 with a contractual obligation to *not leave their house* for two weeks?  police have to stop and check id of any random people in public spaces and then arrest them if they aren't supposed to be out and then keep them locked up for the remainder of the two week quarantine and they have to forfeit the $2000 in addition to a fine.

the only people who can go out are registered to be in public spaces and only the bare minimum of people to keep society functioning.  delivery boys, basic logistics for food/medicine, doctors, nurses, etc.

this will take planning to execute.  get all our ducks in a row, figure out what skeleton crew needs to be authorized to leave their house and get them proper paperwork.  for two weeks, nobody pays rent or mortgages, they stay at home.

**then covid is over in two weeks**.  after those two weeks we can emerge from our homes and live mask free in a post-covid society once again.  all our freedoms returned to us and we are back to normal (with the exception of international travel).

the whole point of the tax is to incentivize people to use green energy alternatives but there arent any. 

and i sure as fuck haven’t been seeing the dividends pay nearly as much as my tax has increased, and the carbon tax is going to be increased by five hundred fifty percent by 2030.

holy shit your naive idealism is just insanely cringe.

you have no idea wtf ur talking about. 
you realize the carbon tax wffects housing prices right? you realize it effects everything right? our housing market is rising due to many reasons, and carbon tax is one of them. as it gets increased(as passed by oic, yay for dictatorships) the effect on housing will exacerbate.

you realize that manufacturers are going to offload the cost of the carbon tax in manufacturing onto the consumer right?

yes im sure you disagree with smegmoo that corporate taxes have no effect whatsoever on low wages in a corporation. they seemed to moss the point - its not like a property tax, a percentage of the value of the asset, and does not increase the overall price (of a cheeseburger for example, and does not then reduce the burger flipper who only makes minimum wage anyway) - put corporate taxes have nothing to do with gdp but purely on the profits of the company.

also the effect of the drop in corporate rates is going to have a delayed effect and theres evidence that there was a great loss in potential revenue, in the past decade. why are the democrats in the saltates going to raise the corporate tax? do you really think that apple, amazon, netflix dont pay any corporate taxes and yet are incredibly profitable?

your whole argument hinges on this : somehow you think capital and investment, which are tax deferring/deductible assets, have something to do with a “taxes on those assets” what taxes apply to them? it seems youre saying that corporate taxes are based (1) on the assets the company has and (2).......nope, i guess thats it. corporate taxes are based on profits - so any capital and investment expenditures are tax deductible - so you buy a new truck - those costs go into expenditures. subtract expenditures from revenue, and voila! profits. so a tax on profits is not at all a tax on assets. thats what sales tax, property tax are. taxes on assets.

by the way, if corporate taxes depress wages, then i would think the opposite to be true, that lowering corp taxes ended up increasing wages. did that happen? no f-ing way. that only happened through minimum wage increases by law.  you are literally making the “trickle down “ argument - raise taxes and you lower wages. its nuts.",conservatives

but that aside, the other problems with your argument is that the law is merely about people in positions of power wearing clothes that identify a religion while in the performance of their duty.  

it’s not to say there aren’t other manifestations of group membership that are expressed in other ways.   this law simply covers a specific well-worn avenue for it: dress codes.  

and whether you want to construe some pride flag as some manifestation of a teacher’s group membership, that’s debatable (and i personally think that people crossing all religious and non-religious groups might be pro-trans), but either way a school in a more progressive part of the country doing that doesn’t mean invalidate dress code laws as an idea or a law in quebec. 

lastly, theists do not have a right to overrule secular laws that happen to come into contention with whatever they claim is a tenant of their beliefs.   just like “freeman on the land” may believe they’re not subject to the laws of canada, yet they don’t get to bypass the laws due to their beliefs.

this is claim based on the assumption that the 2,000 cerb wasn’t any less than what most who got the cerb earned before the pandemic.
