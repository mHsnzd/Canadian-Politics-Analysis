so are you saying palestine is a separate state? 

&gt;ou’re acting as if jewish people didn’t also live on the land? it’s not like there were no jewish people there until 1949. also most of the land was bought legally since world war i and slowly built up. the whole issue right now is that jews bought land from lebanese owners over 50 years ago but never evicted the palestinians living there rent free. it has been argued in court that the sale was legal at the time and should be allow

jesus christ man you can't actually be this naive. like i don't even know what to say to this. where are you getting your information from? 

&gt;yes there are illegal settlements but that doesn’t make up most of israel’s actual land. the jews were also forcibly displaced by the surrounding nations. they expelled all their jewish populace and then planned an attack on israel to wipe them out.

jennifer states that it being based on net wealth is problematic because companies can just take out loans to reduce the valuation. this omits the fact that when a company obtains debt, it gets *cash*. 

let’s say a business take out a $100m loan. the entires are debit cash credit debt. net cash / debt and the valuation is unchanged.

first, the electoral situation this time out is…bizarre.  across the board.  scheer didn’t have to contend with the vaxport issue, nor a ppc leader promising the literally impossible to a small but sizeable group of highly motivated one-issue voters.

second, a leader needs to gain the confidence of voters.  neither scheer nor o’toole have had that chance.  i personally wouldn’t have jettisoned scheer last time, but he never adequately dealt with the abortion issue.  i speak to a lot of centrist fiscal conservatives, and the women always raise abortion as the redline with them for the cpc.

the fact that we got the same result having lost the far-right flank of the party tells us that o’toole is tolerable to more people in the middle.

the biggest thing the federal ndp have going for them, is that they'll never have to actually deliver on any of their promises, and none of their supporters are angry because they didn't deliver exactly what they promised as fast as everyone wants.  if you look at the liberals and long term water advisories, they've made unbelievable progress on a very expensive, very complex problem, and the only reason they haven't met their goal already is because every year, we get more new long term failures in water systems that have been terribly maintained.  by most regards, this is a tremendous success and a huge step forward from the past, yet it's used as a stick to beat the liberals with, because they can't deliver on a simple thing.

from what i've gathered, the ppc doesn't have policies based in racist thought. having conservative immigration and refugee policy isn't inherently racist. similarly, policy trying to prevent first nations communities from being reliant on the government isn't racist either. those are really the only race-related issues that bernier discusses, but i'd appreciate you letting me know if i'm missing anything. you don't have to, obviously; i'm not gonna judge you for not wanting a political debate with some strange

it's more of an example. i'm not saying my ban on street signs is simple.  but notice how many complications you've come up with? this issue are all valid should be balanced against the benefits. but i'd argue charter discrimination due to the religious laws are more serious. 

&gt;you should also consider that according to census, only 5.7% of quebecois identify in a religion other than some variant of christianity. thus you can see that the vast majority of persons impacted by loi 21 are christians. that is unless you say that minority religions are more likely to wear religious symbols? if so, is that not a prejudicial assertion, and thus racist in itself

for charter rights it does not matter how many people are impacted.  i'd argue here that degree of impact is also a factor and that the law affect religious minorities to a greater degree.

&gt;finally, have you considered that perhaps quebec is an attractive place for muslims to immigrate due to its attitude toward religious symbols? or, perhaps, you think that islamic people are incapable of nuance? if so, is that not a prejudicial assertion?

i can't speak for all religious minorities. some are probably in favour. there are merits to laïcité.  that doesn't take away for other religious minorities who now feel unwelcome in quebec and have chosen to leave. the law is discriminatory under canadian constitutional law. elements could be saved at the balancing stage but we haven't got there yet.",liberals

if you mention \"vote efficiency\", \"condorcet winner\", \"party lists\", whatever, 80% of people's eyes will glaze over.

having said all that, if you explain it from the ground up, say having a ranked ballot, more people start to get it.  or that seats reflect vote share.

there is also a depressing amount of fud.  any form of proportional representation will lead to fascism/extremism of some sort!  government will collapse!  both of those can be problems, for sure, but they are fundamentally problems with the wider electorate.  if a majority of voters are voting for extremist parties, your problem isn't the electoral system, it's that a majority of voters support extremism.  if parliament is so fractured, it can't govern, then the problem is the electorate is so fractured.

granted the big tent parties that fptp encourages can paper over some of these fractures, but you'll just end up with different problems.  in a two-party system, majorities are traded back and forth, and you just end up with legislative lurch.  the vegetable party passes \"radish reform\", but then the fruit party just undoes it when they get back into power. factions within a larger big tent party can confuse what a party actually represents (witness the uneasy marriage between the former reform party and progressive conservative party in the current conservative party).

glp00mj,2021-02-01T12:29:40.000-08:00,"canada considering drug decriminalization to fight overdose crisis increased demand will lead to increased production, and soon you’ll have an industry built around the production and distribution of that product. this is especially true when there are low entry costs and low competition due to the industry being new.
now if only something like this happened before to a formerly illegal narcotic called marijuana, well that would just be darn silly.
for your second point, you have to consider whether you think that drug use is so widespread that opening the floodgates of the free market wouldn’t have any major impact on the overall use and that the improved quality and lessened stigma would lead to less overdoses. 
unfortunately we seem to be on opposite sides here on point number two, and your initial statement that there wouldn’t be a larger supply goes against the basics of macroeconomics.
despite this however, i think we can both find common ground in that the idea of large corporations (no possible way that could backfire) or even the government (conservatives getting into power &amp; screwing w/ programs) directly handling the distribution and manufacturing of drugs to be legitimately terrifying.
unfortunately the production of the more advanced opioids, which i’m assuming is what your referring to requires expensive equipment, which leads to the  whole cost of entry into the market increasing and all that so no small businesses could get into the market (and any that would be able to would be bought out for their revolutionary production technique 😝). 
all in all, this would lead to a catch-22 so to say, which would allow for wealth to flow even further up the chain and the masses to literally be addicted to the corporations that control the supply. the best way for us to help addicts is to boost minimum wages and to increase the demand for unskilled workers so that discouraged workers can join the labor force and earn that boosted min wage dough. even better would be  for government sponsored jobs training for those unskilled workers so that they could get higher paying jobs. though there still needs to be demand for those higher paying jobs, and as most of the jobs would be akin to those taught in trade schools, the best that could be done would probably be public works projects to make use of all the newly trained electricians, architects, etc in a manner that would not only offer employment, but also improve the existing infrastructure, but also allow for the development of some of the less “developed” provinces. in reality, while this terribly developed underdeveloped plan could theoretically be implemented, due to canada not being the united states of america, the feds have less “flexibility” so to say.

there are four easy solutions. 
 number 1 - canada legalizes slavery, but not racist slavery, as in it m u s t be multiethnic. becoming the last foothold of slavery, while a horrible practice that’s has ruined the lives of countless would probably help the economy, maybe? if you get around the countless protests both foreign and domestically, and don’t get immediately invaded and annexed by the united states of america in an effort to “liberate our people”, though i guess that could be justified if they didn’t annex and just setup a puppet govt. while freeing slaves.

number 2- canada opens up the possibility of an economic boom by starting up some colonial homestead tier type stuff wherein the feds give away land to foreign investors and immigrants (including land “stealthily” taken away from those first nations folk, those comanche wannabes).

number 3- canada seduces the united states of america into giving her his credit card and buys everything she needs before giving it back. his debt is already so high that he wouldn’t notice the extra charges on his account.  he can ignore the ira because he is the ira. although, canada might have to sleep with the united states to complete her seduction and i don’t know how countries would you know, do it, or how birth control would work. 

number 4- canada just straight up asks to join the united states of america as the 51st state (screw puerto rico) then the new canada starts civil war 2 electric boogaloo, the south rises again, canada takes washington and now america is canada and canada stops being irrelevant to the world at large bc canada is america. sadly canada will have to change name to the united states of america due to the overwhelming amount of americans in comparison to the canadian population.

also, in alberta, where i grew up, i personally know many many people who come from english speaking families, went to french immersion and subsequently went on the obtain a bacchelor's degree either entirely in french or partly in french. many of them speak french very well and can converse without issue. i know quite a few who have had jobs where they must speak primarily in french. all of this in alberta too.

fundamentally, the issue across canada is the availability of quality educational ressources both for french schools and french immersion programs. the courts have found on multiple occasions that provincial governments are underfunding french schools and programs. the supreme court if camada even found as much in bc. many parents want their kids to learn french, but many french schools and french immersion programs have waiting lists to get in, because the ressources and funding simply aren't there. the same is true for kids who want to continue in french or upgrade their french at a post-secondary level. all, or most, french or bingual universities and university campuses outside of quebec are struggling financially and have been for a few years. recently, we've heard what happened with laurentian. the franconphone university of ontario was delayed and got a funding cut when ford got into office. the university of moncton has been struggling due to government cuts, their budget a significantly less than it was 5 or 10 years ago for more students. the u of a's campus saint-jean is also in dire straights. in this last case, it is mostly being caused by badly thought through (or borderline malicious) administrative rules which restrict campus saint-jean's ability to get funding, including per capita funding caps which don't go up with actual demand like they do for other campuses and faculties of the u of a. they get funding for roughly 400 students (per the imposed cap) but actually get 700 students and must turn away many more because the funding is absent. campus saint-jean also suffers from a rule excluding federal funding from the budget used to calculate how many permanent prof positions they can have, which means 25% to 40% of the campus saint-jean's actual budget can't be used to calculate how many permanent prof positions they can offer.

tl;dr many people want to learn french accross canada. the demand is there but the ressources are not. french language education outside quebec has historically, and continues to, suffer from discrimination, mainly in the form of deliberate underfunding.",liberals

(contrast cpc actions towards canada post circa 2011, which imposed a worse contract than management's prior final offer.)

i fundamentally disagree with this characterization of what mediation is. you are using a relative scale between union busting and back to work legislation like that is the entire spectrum of options.

if a employer knows that all they have to do is wait for the government to come in a force people back to work, then the union never had any ground to negotiate on.  the existence  of the mere threat of back to work legislation is a giant unbalancing of the power dynamics between worker run unions and their capital controlled employer. it in self is the means to an end. 

they dynamics of choosing a mediator is also a unbalancing of the whole process because they have to be mutually agree upon.  it means that no mediator is going to ever do more than cut the baby in half. if they ever side with the union too strongly they will never get another contract and vise versa. its some real smooth brain thinking to argue that splitting the baby is always the right move cause you end up with a dead baby every time. it assume that both sides are valid. sometimes there are real problems with working conditions only one side is advocating for health and safety the other is always arguing for the bottom line. splitting that baby is never going to be right. 

if large nationally important businesses can't be ground to a halt by workers than what is the union going to use as leverage.

but anyways, fostering growth in the private sector and establishing systems by which excess wealth is transferred from the rich to those that need it are not mutually exclusive economic approaches. the ndp does not really *say* anything of the like very often, rather focusing pretty much exclusively on the latter aspect (i assume) because it is what actually sets them apart from the liberals and is thus more worthy of being said. but they aren't a socialist party and i doubt they would abandon capitalist profit-centered growth if given power (as much as i would hope that they would, i know we're not quite at that phase yet politically).",liberals

here's a past article from the financial post (national post) that explained it:

https://financialpost.com/news/economy/all-the-reasons-why-canada-needs-immigration-and-more-of-it



&gt; the average age of the population is moving up as life expectancy increases, birth rates decline and the baby boomer generation ages. **by 2040, 25 per cent of the population will be at least 65 years** old, up from 17 per cent today, according to conference board of canada projections.

&gt; in 2017, **health care accounted for 35 per cent of provincial spending** on average and is projected to rise to 40 per cent by 2040, according to conference board data.

the boomers didn't pay enough into the system, especially considering how lifespans have increased.

&gt; economists generally agree on one simple point: **immigrants are a necessary component to achieve economic growth and keep taxpayer-funded systems such as pensions and health care stable and balanced.**

and it's a positive for the economy:

&gt; ...compelled peter dungan, a professor at the university of toronto’s rotman school of management, to build a complex computer model to examine the macroeconomic effects of immigration in canada.

&gt; “it found **generally positive impacts of immigration on the economy.** but even at the lower earning levels … there is still a net positive impact.”


a (right-wing) cd howe report also:

&gt; found that the net tax burden paid by future (unborn) generations of canadians would be around $200,000 greater than the net taxes paid by canadians born in 2017 if immigration falls.

so basically, your kids would have to pay an extra $200,000 in their lifetime, if immigration falls.

also, canada wouldn't be taking in 785,000 immigrants annually. a lot of that would be natural growth as people have kids, grandkids, great-grandkids, etc.

so it's not really much different, and canada is not a \"tiny country\". even with so much tundra, we still have plenty of livable land.

i'm pretty sure i also read before that in 1900, canadians thought canada's population would reach 100 million by 2000 (not 2100). and they even thought winnipeg might become the size of chicago. so those ideas aren't recent.

hb7lw34,2021-09-01T03:24:53.000-07:00,"liberal party of canada platform: \"forward. for everyone.\" i don't see rent to own as being practical in any form. here's what they're saying:

&gt;**introduce a new rent-to-own program to help make**it easier for renters to get on the path towards home ownership while renting. the program will be designed based on three principles: the landlordmust commit to charging a renter a lower-than market rate to help canadians build up savings for a down payment; the landlord must commit to ownership in a five-year term or less; and proper safeguards will be in place to protect the future homeowner.\"

so a landlord is basically committing to a crap-ton of downside without any apparent benefit. how will the government make this work, give the landlord an equivalent of a down payment to incentivize them? even then it commits to lower than market rate housing, if the tenant get to own it after 4-5 years, the landlord presumably only comes out ahead if housing prices tank before then.

i assume this is for single family homes being rented out only, because it gets even more complicated if you're talking about units in an apartment building. how does the landlord sell the building when you own part of it, do they lose a ton of value in the property if they're unable to sell it because no one wants to buy a property that they don't have full control over? responsibilities for repair might require a new system too.

i don't understand how the government can get any landlord to sign on without throwing a ton of money at it that would be more efficient elsewhere.

in the uk, their rent to own program only applied to social housing, if that's what they're doing here, then we're just looking to get rid of our social housing.

lastly, i suspect there's a ton of provincial regulations and zoning issues that are outside of federal control, so i suspect it'll just be a pain in the ass to do all around.",liberals

i found they put *a lot* of emphasis on race, gender, and diversity throughout the document, and even had a race and gender impact assessment after most sections. this struck me as something different the liberals did compared to others. it is very apparent the liberals are trying to do their best, or at least appear to do their best, at doing things more *intersectionally.*

portugal's model is one that i'm sure you have heard of. after decriminalizing, drug-related deaths have plummeted, a much lower proportion of prisoners were sentenced for drug-related \"offences\", and rates of drug use remain well below the eu average. community service, fines, and other administrative punitive measures are clearly more effective than the system we have in place today.

and speaking of responsibility, the majority of it lies in the hands of the sackler family and governments who continue to perpetuate this useless \"get tough on drugs\" approach. this opioid crisis was caused by purdue, wockhardt, and other opportunistic pharmaceutical companies who knew these drugs were highly addictive due to their mechanism of action. these drugs release high levels of dopamine and most who get hooked on these drugs usually started with a benign health issue like chronic pain or pain management after a car accident. although not all who start this course of drug treatment become addicted, there are uncontrollable factors like genetics and early development that definitely play a major role for someone falling into the cycle of addiction. more research needs to be done in this area, but early evidence still suggests many addicts might get hooked because of factors out of their control that make them more susceptible. 

i agree with you that this isn't a magic silver bullet to stop all overdoses and to end this crisis. however, this is a highly effective method of reducing deaths and drug toxicity which will save lives.",liberals

&gt; researchers with whom i am associated have modeled these policies, and i note that our forecasts of the policy effects concur approximately with the federal government’s own forecasts. this is because, after years of methodological disputes in the 1980s and 1990s, the last decade has seen a convergence of climate policy forecasting and evaluation methods around the world, thanks in part to the coordinating and comparison role played by stanford university’s energy modeling forum.

economists are confident that they can predict the approximate impact of a given carbon price.

the national carbon price floor started at a low level (it was $20/t in 2019) and rises over time. this gives people time to make changes - for example it makes more sense to switch from a gas-burning car (to an electric car) when it's close to the end of its life, instead of scrapping a lot of nearly-new cars. so it's not surprising that the initial impact has been limited. it's now $40/t, one source of uncertainty (the legal question) has been eliminated just recently, and one source of uncertainty (the question of what happens if o'toole forms government after the next election) has been reduced.",conservatives

conservative leader erin o'toole told the house of commons today that he's pulling his caucus members from a national security committee he claims is being used to cover up sensitive documents about canada's top infectious diseases lab.

\"the committee is now being used as a political tool by the prime minister to cover up the winnipeg lab incident,\" o'toole said during today's question period.

o'toole and the conservatives have in recent weeks raised many questions about the mysterious firing of two employees from the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg and the lab's relationship with the wuhan institute of virology.

while the current scientific consensus is that the pandemic likely started due to human contact with an infected animal, there is a renewed push to investigate the \"lab leak\" theory, which posits that the virus originated in a wuhan research lab.",conservatives

what anti-racism campaigners point out correctly is that otherwise you’re just picking based on immutable traits with extra steps. if you base your decision on who has the proven skills and abilities already you’re just delegating the decision to an earlier decision-maker. that decision-maker might have made their decision based entirely on immutable characteristics. this is often the case where rich kids get opportunities purely through nepotism to start then based on performance later on because people claim that they have “proven leadership” in the nepotistic position. 

also, you’re whole assumption is wrong... on paper ms paul is the perfect candidate *regardless* of her immutable traits... based entirely on her skills and experience. she’s fluently bilingual. she went to a very academic high school then went directly to law school and from there completed a master’s in public policy at princeton. she worked her way through school with internships and jobs in parliament, queens park, the na du québec in both nonpartisan and partisan roles working for every major party. she passed the bar and worked as an environmental lawyer founding her own sole practitioner firm... and
then she founded a whole bunch of public policy initiatives both nationally and internationally.


the questions no one thought to ask though was... why did she actually leave the liberal and conservative parties? who is an intern for one then an intern for the other then running for an entirely different party? why was she founding so many organizations rather than joining or leading any well-established ones? 

she’s obviously smart, hard working and is charismatic and has all the hard skills that people expect of a leader.... but has exactly zero soft skills. she massaged her entire career and resume to cover up this fact. her immutable characteristics played a role the same way that justin trudeau’s (who was his father again?), erin o’toole’s (son of durham mpp and automotive executive) and stephen harper’s (son of a top oil industry executive running for parliament in calgary’s richest riding) did in their early political careers...

... the difference was that she just kept restarting her political career in a different corner of politics/public policy and no one ever questioned why.",liberals

but the problem is that \"idiot politicians\" won't get out of the way, because that's not how housing policymaking works. zoning and development decisions are up to city hall, and before getting there they get a myriad of feedback from community associations and public consultations. these are overwhelmingly dominated by people who can afford to engage in the laborious process - homeowners who have time to spare - and will typically oppose anything that provides a temporary inconvenience to them. as such they have a major influence in housing decisions, and municipal politics in general - and so politicians feel accountable to them regardless of their ideology.

this can only be stopped if the province comes in to smack municipalities silly, as they're the ones who can determine the power municipalities wield - you kinda see it in amalgamated municipalities like calgary, edmonton and ottawa where the power of community associations is diluted, meaning they don't have as much capacity to stop local development (though that brings its own set of problems). but taking away municipal powers from housing decisions directly is a third rail no one dares touch, as provincial parties won't take a risk that would net them bipartisan shellacking for unclear political gain.",conservatives

i doubt anyone would suggest that, let alone me.

can guarantee most would rather just not get involved in the conversation. there are other things for the canadian government to do.

&gt; besides, why do you call the ndp motion unprompted

because it isn't exactly a hot button topic that canadians really care about overly, it was brought up by their (certain) members/ridings not because a new revelation or an out cry from the public, but because of their well... obsession with israel i guess. 

&gt; not concerned about canadian issues but refuse to say the same about the uyghur genocide deceleration that the conservatives also championed (an opposition party)

for the record, i took the first reference to an study from the first article: 

&gt; the 1985 macdonald royal commission report concluded that immigration did not contribute to economic growth and, in fact, caused a decline in per capita income and real wages

i am unable to easily find a digital copy of part 5 of the macdonald royal commission (parts 1 &amp; 2 can be found here: http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/472251/publication.html). i also can't find anything about immigration in the summaries of the report (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macdonald_commission). i cannot verify the veracity of this statement at this time. 

as an aside, if we brought someone into the country, and they were making an below average salary, which in 2019 is $49,000 (source: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901) they would also cause \"a decline in per capita income\". so i'm already wary of this article trying to stretch statistics to prove their point. 

this is from 2 lines down in the article:

&gt; in 1991, the economic council of canada reached the same conclusion.

and this is a summary from wikipedia's [economic impact of immigration to canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economic_impact_of_immigration_to_canada)

&gt; in 1991, the economic council of canada found that periods of immigration were not directly linked to periods of high growth. they noted that \"a historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for economic prosperity. in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times when net immigration was nil or negative. later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, clearly, there is no long-term correlation.\" however, **the same report found that a high rate of immigration was good for canada's future, and recommended expanding immigration rates to bring canada's population to 100 million**.

this does not bode well for the opinion article because this continues to lend credence to my earlier thought that they are selectively choosing the data the present in order to push an opinion. 

so, all that said, i don't have time to do this for every claim in the articles. therefore, i am now asking you to find better sources or point to specific ones in the article that have stronger support if you want me to agree with your conclusion.",conservatives

but let's go for it, i guess.

your first link is a call for (health) *information* to be nonpartisan. this is the kind of thing that pretty much everyone agrees to in principle but then we all fight about what it means afterwards. it's also doesn't speak to your claim: 

* [health information](https://uwm.edu/publichealth/opinion-there-is-a-critical-need-for-science-based-nonpartisan-information-about-the-pandemic/) should be collected, analyzed, prioritized, and disseminated in a nonpartisan way

is a totally different idea than 

&gt; [health is a nonpartisan issue](https://old.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/pmemvu/peoples_party_official_charged_with_assault_in/hchti6q/) 

---

the [second link you provided](https://www.kff.org/news-summary/science-must-serve-as-nonpartisan-guide-to-addressing-covid-19-pandemic-opinion-piece-says/) is interesting. it suggests that science can and should guide decision-making regarding the pandemic *to address the fact* that it *has become* polarized. the conclusion that allowing science to \"help end the scourge of the pandemic and set us on a course to rebuild our economy\" [... will require ...] \"our political leaders to come together to prioritize and champion public health\" is loosely connected to to your [second point](https://old.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/pmemvu/peoples_party_official_charged_with_assault_in/hchti6q/) but completely disagrees with your first point that \"[the pandemic isn't a political issue](https://old.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/pmemvu/peoples_party_official_charged_with_assault_in/hchp8jg/)\". they're more saying that evidence-based health policy *is necessarily* a political issue and so it *should be* non-partisan - their frustration is that it is partisan.

so while they flatly contradict your first statement, i think they also question your second: if you think that health *is* non-partisan, like you said, then they disagree with you. if you think health *should be* non-partisan then: (i) you should say that, and, (ii) again, everyone will agree with you in principle and we'll all disagree about what that means in practice.

notwithstanding the title of [your third link](https://www.columbian.com/news/2017/aug/09/in-our-view-health-is-nonpartisan/), i'd argue that they're supporting bipartisan policy more than they're supporting non-partisan policy... but in the american context i'll take what i can get.

anyway, they are discussing fairly specific policies - mostly the aca and medicare but with some other stuff sprinkled in - and basically argue that bipartisan cooperation among house members can help improve existing legislation (writ large). well... sure... if only!

the person that chose to take part in a system of beliefs that forces them to not take part in certain activities is willingly choosing that it is not forced upon them. they live in a society that doesn’t deem appropriate for figures of authority to showcase their religion, it’s not discrimination against them specifically it’s just a standard. i guess it’s a bit hard to understand for people in a country that is ready to allow, in many provinces for example, sikhs to drive motorcycles without an helmet even tho those are important security guidelines that were put in place for everyone. driving a motorcycle isn’t a fundamental right and not allowing someone to drive one without an helmet isn’t discrimination and neither is demanding that public officials in positions of power not showcase their system of beliefs to every constituent they are serving.

most conservatives i know don't have any moral objections to policies the ndp proposes (unlike some of our caucus members), but rather feel that such plans are made in haste and are functionally unsustainable from a fiscal perspective.

i don't oppose publically funded perception and dental coverage, but i want to see a road map that allows the government to pay for it without increasing the tax burden and costs or living for canadian in the process. also need to recognize that this is a primarily provincial issue the feds can't actually do much about.

i don't oppose a basic income, but programs that are universal in nature are almost always inefficient and direct support to people who don't actually need it. i'm in full support of a negative income tax, and it should be noted that the canadian right wing was initially the side that popularized the basic income idea in the 30s and 40s here (read up on the social credit movement and the port hope conference)

i could go on, but at the end of the day my problem with the ndp is that they aren't realistic enough. they don't have the right priorities for a federal government.",conservatives

negative, in this particular case, the person was going through a tough time and it was the only thing that they found any sort of enjoyment in. in the case of mass shooters, they didn't care about the firearm in and of itself, only that it was a tool that could be used. if it wasn't a firearm, it would've been a bomb, or gas and a match, or a car/truck, or any of the other myriad of ways that a deranged person can kill many people. marc lepine, for instance, was driven by a hatred of women, and could have just as easily gone on a stabbing spree, or become a serial killer. bissonette could just have easily block the doors to the mosque and set it on fire. the method shouldn't be the focus, but the people. wasting time trying to put bandaids on the problem only wastes time, money, and political will.

\\&gt;red herring. i was talking about mandatory mental health assessments   
before people are allowed to purchase any firearm, perhaps even   
mandatory annual mental health assessments for all gun owners like they   
in germany and switzerland. these countries have both higher rates of   
gun ownership and less shootings because of a culture that emphasizes   
more personal responsiblitly and stricter regulation of gun owners.

switzerland also allows all members of the militia to keep their assault rifles in their own homes. in fact, the civilian/semi-auto version of their assault rifles (sig 550) has been banned in canada since the '90s. the very similar sig 540 is still non-restricted, despite being similar to the 550, and having identical function to the ar15. but i digress. how exactly do you plan on implementing such a mental screening process? as it stands, mental health professionals, and regular doctors for that matter (and spouses, and neighbours, and concerned friends...) are all capable of reporting a potentially dangerous person to the rcmp if they are worried. in fact, a license needs at least 2 separate people to sign off on the application, and it includes a phone interview.",conservatives

quebec has made clear time and time again that they don't support the charter. all three parties that have been in power since 1982 - the qlp, pq, and now caq, have all in various ways violated people's charter rights. minorities living in quebec have been screwed over time and time again, and governments that violate their charter rights are rewarded, not punished. despite generational change, the quebec nation has not accepted the charter. let's give quebec autonomy over cultural policy, and get rid of the fucking notwithstanding clause. the rest of us can enjoy our rights, quebec can do its own thing, and every move by quebec doesn't become a national crisis.

because right now, canadian politicians are so afraid of antagonizing quebec that we have a charter that often goes unenforced, and quebec's overuse of the nwc has made it such an acceptable part of canadian politics that doug ford just had the balls to use it to limit political speech. either we have a charter of rights, or we don't, but it's ridiculous to have a legal document that gets enforced except when it doesn't. a constitution is useless if it can't be enforced - so give quebec complete autonomy over culture and the rest of canada can enjoy our charter rights.

trudeau deserves criticism for being so weak on this front, because lord knows the liberals need all the support they can get in quebec. the man who got in, in part due to his strong stance on protecting minority religion rights, is now letting a province with a quarter of our population violate them. but looking back to 2019, trudeau's wishy washy \"maybe i'll do something about c-21 idk yet\" answer was the best we heard from any federal leader, because the others didn't even indicate a remote willingness to do anything about it. it's not just trudeau, we have a systemic problem where one province's values are way out of line with the majority, but that province has so much electoral power that politicians are just letting the document protecting individual and minority rights get trampled on. let's just apply the charter fully to the nine provinces and three territories, and quebec can do their own thing.

the other option is to step up and take the political risk by standing up for the charter against quebec policies. if politicians are scared to upset quebec, then split them from the charter entirely. but i'm tired of this double standard where we purport to be a country that cares about rights and freedoms except when it poses a political risk",liberals

every test has a rate of false positives, and a rate of false negatives. as a result, the amount of hiv we should actually expect in the blood supply is the rate of false negatives of the screening test, scaled by the true positive rate in the incoming samples.

we can reduce this in two ways: reduce the rate of false negatives of the test, or reduce the rate of true positives in the samples we test.

~~more effective tests are expensive, so to manage that expense, blended samples are tested. this means that in addition to the false negative issue, you also have collateral damage from true positives: any positive sample will result in a bunch of negative samples in the same blended test batch being thrown out.~~

(above paragraph is false. we don't throw out the whole batch if it tests positive, we go back and test all individual samples. this means that the collateral damage is increased testing cost, not decreased supply.)

men who have sex with men in canada are hiv positive at a rate between 3% and 24% depending on region and survey. the estimated general population prevalence is ~0.17%. this means that msm in canada have between ~20x and ~200x the prevalence of hiv compared to the general population. more worryingly, as of 2008 it was estimated that up to 28% of hiv positive msm in canada were unaware of their infection. ([more recent data](https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-canada) suggests this rate is now ~13%, but that is still uncomfortably high.)

so allowing msm to donate blood will inevitably have one of two results: either we will end up with hiv positive blood in the blood supply, or we will face significantly increased testing costs as the rate of positive donations increases. this is a statistical inevitability of allowing donation from a group with 20-200x the hiv prevalence of the background population.

now, again, i'm a gay man. keep that in mind for the following analogy: would you be comfortable allowing injection drug users to donate blood? i think the answer to that question is clearly a resounding \"no\". the question about allowing msm to donate is effectively the same one - slightly less severe prevalence, but still incredibly high - complicated by human rights issues.

it is a sad but evident fact that msm are afflicted by hiv at an absurdly high rate compared to the general population. it is not rational blood supply policy to allow donations from a group like that.

the blood supply system is not a human rights exercise for donors. protecting recipients of blood from blood-supply-mediated infections is and should be the only priority in crafting these policies. for these reasons, the blood ban is rational, and should remain in place. i imagine this is why trudeau has not moved on it, despite his virtue signaling promises on the subject.",liberals

&gt;conclusions

1. it was found that among different contingents the minimum detection rate of hiv infection in regions of the russian federation in 2013 has been registered among blood donors.
2. maximum detection rate of hiv among men practicing sex with men actualizes the need for a ban on their participation in blood donation.
3. the detection rate of hiv among donors, as well as the ratio of detection of hiv among donors and other categories surveyed indicate a lack of efficiency of formation of donor contingent of supporters of a healthy lifestyle.
4. a direct positive correlation detection of hiv in blood donors and region population, the volume of blood processing, as well as all volumes of blood wastage due to markers of bloodborne infections except the volume due to hbs-antigen.

i personally have no idea the accuracy of that study, [russia is a very homophobic country,](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/1-5-russians-want-gays-lesbians-eliminated-survey-finds-n1191851) and that [they suffer high corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_in_russia) and [massive socio-economic inequalities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7327491/), which makes everything coming from russia suspect.

in my heart i want this ban eliminated in canada as i feel it is discriminatory, however i am also old enough to remember [the blood scare in '86](https://publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/en/document-000416/).  it was awful and i don't want a return of that either.

at that point, at least there's transparency. maybe the reasoning is that if you allow it then, at some point in the next 10 years, a canadian will get hiv from a transfusion: perhaps we're too sensitive to that risk, aids is pretty manageable these days. maybe the numbers say that it would actually decrease the amount of usable blood since individual testing isn't economically viable. maybe the numbers would reveal that a question about prep or monogamy would make it make sense.

&gt; mulroney, while publicly endorsing clark at a press conference in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's leadership review. **joe clark's key quebec organizer rodrigue pageau was in fact a double agent, working for mulroney, undermining clark's support.**

and more recently, scheer's dirty tricks to win cpc leadership, with a possibly rigged vote:

https://ipolitics.ca/2017/06/04/cpc-cheating-party-of-canada/

&gt; conservatives have been caught multiple times cheating in the electoral process, or fiddling with it for political advantage.

&gt; the in-and-out scandal caught the cpc breaking election expenses limits in the 2006 election, forcing the party plead guilty to a criminal offence and to repay $230,000 to canadian taxpayers.

&gt; then there was the robocalls voter suppression scandal arising out of the 2011 election. 

&gt; the cpc also initially lied about a second robocalls campaign in saskatchewan.

&gt; nor can scheer argue that his party’s legacy of cheating around elections is ancient history. great balls of fire, these guys have already accused each other of cheating, not once but twice in the very leadership process that the former speaker of the house just won.

election promises are always a messy thing. as they say, no plan survives contact with the enemy. you can promise all the things you want, with real plans to follow through, but the reality is that things will change during your tenure in office, you'll have emergencies to deal with, changes in public opinion and priorities, and the complexities of running the government - it's simply not realistic to expect that every policy position from the election will be followed through on.

&gt; for instance it still lists \"will not prorogue\" as kept which is obviously false.

the actual statement was “stephen harper has used prorogation to avoid difficult political circumstances. we will not.”. since they prorogued parliament as the throne speech did not address covid 19 (obviously the most important issue at the time) you could argue that it was not to avoid difficult political circumstances, but was necessary. if you're a partisan conservative though, i'm sure you'd say it was to deflect from questions regarding we. we're both biased, just in different ways. the actual truth probably lies somewhere between those two biased looks.

if someone had hiv and was beyond the window, they would be able to donate, but their blood would be tested anyway. the test would come back positive and the blood would have to be thrown away, but then they would know that they have hiv, which would be a good thing as it would prevent further transmission.

but,  this news isn't \"new\", as erin said it would be up to the provinces to either keep their current carbon taxing system, or adopt the carbon savings account back when the cpc announced the environment platform. back in april. when erin is talking about his environmental platform, he keeps on talking about the carbon savings account, which the cpc voters don't like, nor is it interesting to people who are left leaning people. erin should be emphasizing that the carbon savings account is optional to provinces, while at the same time emphasizing his environmental policies that are actually strong, like;

* investing $1b in hydrogen energy
* esg-i leadership
* investing $1b in small modular reactors
* implementing a net-zero foundation
* investing $1b in electric vehicle manufacturing

the one thing we know that works for the liberals is throwing out numbers as the higher the number, the more \"impressive\" it is. if erin is trying to appeal to the left/moderate, he needs to stress these other policies to emphasize how committed the party is to combating climate change and helping the environment. it's so frustrating to hear him talk about the environment and all he talks about is a stupid carbon savings account.",liberals
