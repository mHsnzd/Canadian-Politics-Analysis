not if you want it to be a strong federation, and the differences should be purely administrative in nature. having different rights, is just wrong. (and yes, i know the code civil makes right adjacent things different, but they still have to work within the charter.)

&gt; if we can't change their minds, and they can't change ours, then the most obvious solution is to give quebec full control over their culture

nope, the most obvious solution, is for us to be different countries. however, i still think canada is better with quebec, so will work to get them on the right track.

&gt;  the very point of a constitution is to make sure that certain things are beyond the reach of any government.

no, the point of a constitution is to codify how the government works, in a manner that is difficult to change, so that government functions can be predictable over the long term. constitutions can generally be amended, making everything they protect, subject to change by the government, under the correct conditions.

&gt; so did the courts really enforce the charter?

yes, because s33 is part of it. i get that you don't like that, but it's part of the rules.

&gt; letting quebec control its cultural affairs takes it out of federal politics,

pretty sure that's how it already is, but we're talking about rights here, not culture.

&gt; clearly there is one part of canada that doesn't support it, and their actions weaken the charter's authority.

how? using s33 doesn't weaken the charter, that's using the charter.

when quebec's secular laws first came into place, they affected the whole population (which was mostly catholic). these secular laws \"discriminated\" towards the majority of the population and stopped them from having their religious customs/symbols when they were representing the state. now with immigrants coming from countries that have different religious customs quebec must adjust its secular laws so everyone is affected equally. even if this new law may indeed be affecting certain populations more than others, laws already existed to address the other groups (for decades).  


is it islamaphobic for turkey to ban all religious symbols and outfits? no, just as it isn't for states (i.e. france, south korea, quebec) that have been secular for a long time to make sure secularism gets applied to everyone equally.  


furthermore, people tend to act like quebec is against muslims and discriminates against them. these people clearly haven't visited quebec and have no clue about it lol. the immigrants in quebec are mostly people from the middle east, africa, and haiti (as these are the people our government/society wants as we often share some degree of french cultural heritage).  

this article and opinion in general just screams out ignorance and fear of the different that has clearly been engrained in many anglo-canadians over generations. also just so people don't just brush away my claims as another \"racist quebecer\" i am myself a first-generation immigrant as well as a member of quebec's first nations (one parent of each side), so please don't just dismiss my opinion because i don't share your pov.",liberals

à les lire, on dirait qu'ils se lèvent le matin en maudissant la loi 21. ils mangent leur petit déjeuner en maudissant la loi 21. ils chient en maudissant la loi 21. ils se brossent les dents en maudissant la loi 21. ils doivent faire des cauchemars au sujet de la loi 21.

le pire c'est que monsieur-madame-tout-le-monde au canada-anglais n'en a absolument rien à foutre de cette loi. ils vivent leur vie au quotidien sans y penser ou avoir d'opinion forte là dessus, comme la plupart des citoyens. ça ne change rien dans leur vie à eux. mais l'élite politico-médiatique anglophone s'obstine à ramener le sujet.

suite à certains temps plus calmes, les mêmes (et c'est souvent les mêmes chroniqueurs, faut le remarquer) se trouvent des prétextes pour revenir à la charge. même si le contexte d'origine n'a aucun rapport. et on redevient inondés, ou emmerdés,  par leurs bêtises qui ne finissent plus.

lier la loi 21 à l'islamophobie ou à la haine c'est absurde. comme si la loi 21 n'était pas la suite logique aux démarches de la révolution tranquille et de réaffirmer la laïcité de l'état. comme si d'autres pays comme la france n'avaient pas mis des lois semblables en application bien avant qu'il y ait une population significative de musulmans. comme si.

this is the same argument that opponents to gay marriage made. banning gay marriage isn't discriminatory, because straight people are equally banned from marrying the same sex. see? equality. in practice faiths are treated extremely differently. some of them manage to be totally unaffected by bill 21. if the goal is secularism, then why is this okay? 

&gt;the goal, in my eyes, (i'm not even sure whether or not i'm for or against it, btw) is to allow access to a secularized education (and system), uninfluenced by religious beliefs. now if the children decide to become or stay religious or to stray away from it is up to them. not to the system. everyone gets an equal chance and hopefully education/values this way.

once more i will ask...how does bill 21 achieve this goal? i'm against religious indoctrination of children by their teachers as well. i think you'll find basically all the critics of bill 21 are against it. bill 21 ensures that christians teaching math are completely unaffected, while a sikh teacher cannot continue in that same role without renouncing or violating their beliefs. in both cases, how does the faith of the teacher indoctrinate children into a specific religion? how does merely seeing the teachers turban influence kids into a religion? what, if you see too many hijabs you'll start wearing one? explain the logic.

why should i trust the lpc at their word? i never said anything about trusting o'toole at his word. this thread has strictly been about the ethics of sex selective abortion.

thinking that i only comment in bad faith shows me you clearly only read what you wanted to, and that was on posts of canadian conservative. if you actually read most of my comments you would find i'm morally liberal and fiscally conservative. my flair on that subreddit is even \"red torry\".

i think that the counter-argument of \"christians being unaffected\" falls flat once we realize that bill 21 is simply correcting an oversight made years ago, because indeed religious symbols aren't as apparent on christians than on some other religions.

as for \"the logic\" you're howling for, you have to understand the context of the quiet revolution and see the bigger picture in terms of quebec society and its institutions throughout the years. bill 21 is inscribed within that whole movement against originally catholic church, the ideologies it was imposing on people and its rejection of the scientific method.

gymbins,2021-05-18T07:24:05.000-07:00,"quebec can modify part of the canadian constitution unilaterally, trudeau says &gt;the feds are not going to interfere with a province requesting an amendment that only applies to them.

i'm not suggesting they are. my point isn't about whether or not the feds would try to block quebec's amendments to the ca 1867 - it's about whether quebec can actually amend the act itself without consent from the federal houses of parliament. quite simply, i am saying quebec cannot.

but that's the rub - i *do* read the pm's comments as a signal that ottawa intends to do nothing in response to bill 96. that's perfectly fine and valid. but since the text of the ca 1867 can't be amended without parliament's consent and a proclamation by the governor general, the scenario where ottawa does nothing is also a scenario where the text of the ca 1867 doesn't get updated to match bill 96.

all of this leads to one of three scenarios:

1) ottawa does nothing, the ca 1867 isn't updated, and quebec either has to a) accept that parliament's consent is required, and request that consent, or b) take the feds to court to try and force them to update the act based on quebec's unilateral amendments (a challenge which they would likely lose);

2) ottawa accepts quebec's unilateral right to amend the ca 1867 and updates the act, at which point public interest litigation from the rest of canada takes the feds to court over the issue, where they likely lose and are forced to accept that parliament's consent is required; or

3) the (hopefully) least contentious route: everyone recognizes parliament's consent is required, and after bill 96 passes the quebec government asks ottawa to pass a resolution in parliament enacting the change to the statutes of canada.

&gt;everything you listed is pretty much a rubber stamp.

on this i'm less certain - for a few reasons.

first - there are valid reasons parliament might oppose a change to official languages in quebec implemented via the national constitution. mainly, this would be concern around the minority language protections for english-speaking minorities (the entire reason changes of this nature explicitly require federal consent in the first place). of course, this is a solvable problem.

second - the change to declare quebecers a nation - indeed, to update the national constitution to explicitly say so - likely represents an alteration to the architecture of the constitution, even if it's just declaratory. it constitutionally entrenches a status for quebec in the constitution which is unique relative to all of the other provinces. it is really not insane to imagine some provinces (e.g. alberta) going to court to argue that such an amendment is *not* bilateral, but rather national in scope, and requires the consent of seven provinces representing 50% of the population (ie the general formula). the fact that such amendments have been attempted (unsuccessfully) via the general formula in the past certainly doesn't help. so that change in particular could be dead in the water for the time being. but we'll see i suppose.",liberals

the house of commons in a previous parliament passed a declaratory resolution (brought forward by the government at the time) saying it recognized quebec as a nation within a nation. this concept is not currently a part of any law, and it is not in any way embedded in the national constitution. (i'm not saying it shouldn't be, just that it isn't.)

&gt;no one is questioning that except canadians who want to appropriate quebecois culture as their own.

i wasn't claiming anyone was questioning it. in fact, i wasn't discussing the merits or drawbacks of bill 96's content at all.

i was discussing whether or not quebec can add text to the national constitution (specifically, the 1867 *constitution act*) unilaterally (i.e. without the consent of both houses of parliament). the amending formula described in section 43 of the *constitution act, 1982* seems to make it explicitly clear that they cannot do so - amendments affecting the use of french or english within a province require consent (via a resolution) from both houses of parliament, and enacting changes to the *constitution act, 1867* requires a proclamation from the governor general. furthermore, writing a provision into the act which declares the quebecois people to be a nation is broad enough in scope that some experts have argued it likely requires the agreement of seven provincial legislatures, not simply a bilateral agreement between quebec and ottawa (and certainly not the national assembly on its own).",liberals

sure, the cpc can urge this *now*, but could they act so righteous whilest being fairly active in a couple of illegal wars?

still, it's important to shed that political bullshit and call things out for what they are.  definitely china is trying to establish a monoculture.  some folks like to label that as genocide, but is it?  i mean, really?  because if it is, then the adoption of the global internet and modernly compatible economy also is.

canada will need some allies before we can afford to take any kind of stand. australia and new zealand are good candidates. britain is preoccupied with the brexit fiasco, and the usa can no longer get be counted on, even with the change in administration. china's strategy of investing in africa and south america makes most of those countries unlikely allies. that leaves the eu, and i don't know if any of them have enough invested in the far east to take a strong stand.

hbviiqt,2021-09-06T10:50:35.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] your point was never entirely invalid but it was never correct either, and nothing has changed in that regard. 

the simple fact is that in order to get what you want in a democracy, you probably are going to have to give up some things other people want. so a good conservative recognizes that unless the day comes where most people are conservative, then we're going to have to give up a few things here and there to make them happy. 

so if he promised to get rid of the carbon tax, and then brings in 'carbon savings', that's bad. but - at least you can say honestly that he's reduced the tax by 78 percent ish and we actually get control of the money instead of it going to trudeau, so the people getting taxed the worse get the most back. 

so... a concession. and arguably necessary to win. well - i'd rather have 78 percent than nothing. but - major red flag that he wasn't entirely honest. 

do you kick him for that? no, but you do let him know you're not happy. but that's not enough on it's own. pretending that this is some sort of moral crisis is wrong. 

but then he gets worse.  he was clear in his platform that he would protect gun owners from that law. that was actual party policy. 

and he did a 100 degree flip. not \"gee we have to make concenssions\", just an out and out flip. and he didn't even say sorry to the gun owners. and it was completely unnecessary. all he had to say was \"look, all we know at this point is that gun crime is rising under the libs, so we're going to do a comprehensive public review of civil laws and criminal laws around guns to put a stop to it, and until we do i can't tell you what that will look like, but canada will be safer once we're done.\"  boom. 

now he's got a bit of a track record. he's not a liberal - but he's no conservative. he will do or say anything to get what he wants and if that means doing everything that makes liberals happy, so be it.   


well - we can't have that. so - now he's crossed a line. and we have to consider that. 

so no - it's not \"better to lose as a conservative\". it's better to find a way to win and bring as much 'conservative' to the table as possible.  but - it's pointless to win as a liberal and give up on conservatism. and that may be what we're facing now.",liberals

well i guess that's part of the argument he's making:

&gt;woo said that while there may be legitimate concerns about the conditions the uyghurs face, parliamentarians should avoid passing motions on sensitive issues like this because it would needlessly embarrass china or suggest canada believes it is morally superior. canadians may be concerned about the uyghurs, but our criticism should be made in the spirit of friendship and \"out of a desire for china to succeed as a nation of many ethnicities.\"  
&gt;  
&gt;**\"the fact that china does not share our view of individual freedoms or, indeed, our interpretation of freedoms based on the charter is not a basis on which to lecture the chinese on how they should govern themselves,\" woo said, adding that the chinese would be appalled by some canadian policies like medical assistance in dying, but do not interfere in our domestic affairs.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;**\"i much prefer the vagaries of democratic choice to the certainty of authoritarian rule, but we cannot be smug,\" woo said. \"we also cannot deny that the chinese state has its own claim to a kind of legitimacy, even if we don't like it.\"**

but he clearly goes beyond that point too.

the article mentions an interesting quote from trudeau from last week, which i must have missed, regarding the comparison between first nations and uighurs:

&gt;\"the journey of reconciliation is a long one, but it is a journey we are on. china is not even recognizing that there is a problem. that is a pretty fundamental difference,\" trudeau said last week when asked about china's statement at the un that it was \"deeply concerned about the serious human rights violations against the indigenous people in canada.\"  
&gt;  
&gt;\"in canada, we had a truth and reconciliation commission. where is china's truth and reconciliation commission? where is their truth? where is the openness that canada has always shown and the responsibility that canada has taken for the terrible mistakes of the past, and indeed, many of which continue into the present?\"

the easiest path to criticize the government is to conflate the pandemic itself with the restrictions.  by doing so, a critic simultaneously speaks to both the anti-pandemic crowd and the anti-lockdown crowd.

vaccination failure is one path towards this dual-pronged criticism.  if only vaccination were universal and instant, the pandemic would be over _and_ the lockdowns would be over.

another criticism in the same vein is that of border control: if canada had (allegedly) taken simple actions to not import so many covid cases via airports / travelers, then the pandemic would not have hit as hard and the lockdowns would not have been as strict / would have been over earlier / etc.

without these double-barreled criticisms, the opposition has to take a more controversial stance somewhere along a freedom vs control spectrum.  for a given pandemic, advocating for less restriction is almost always an argument for more cases, and vice versa in that an argument for better public health is an argument for more restriction.  that pleases at most one group at a time.

for specifically conservative opposition, fiscal restraint also makes it difficult to argue against the government's support measures.  the ndp can easily argue that aid is not generous enough or misplaced to help businesses rather than people, but the conservatives' natural argument would be against the overall expense.  it doesn't take a pr expert to realize that \"the government gave too much money to people out of work\" is not, at the moment, a winner.",conservatives

on an aside, i recall this ndp candidate from the last election in 2019, i had lived in ottawa west-nepean at the time. i told her i was a disillusioned red tory thinking of voting green, when she came to my apartment complex, and she (and her team) proceeded to tell me that the conservatives are a bunch of white supremacists, racists, and climate-deniers. it wasn't exactly the *best* way to try to woo me, as i had given her an in on talking about the environment and spending, and instead she took it that route.

anita vanderbelt, on the other hand, handled herself rather well in discussion with me. she was quite respectful, and didn't go out of her way to call conservatives bigots, but rather friends and neighbours who she disagrees with. she joked around about eventually getting me to vote for her.

additionally the senate is on break until september but trudeau has been pushing for the senate to pass the conversion therapy ban bill over the summer and senate seems like they will do so. signaling the talk of the town in ottawa is that if it doesn't pass over the summer it won't pass at all as parliament will be dissolved.

hb6r2tt,2021-08-31T23:52:24.000-07:00,"canadian economy shrank 1.1% in q2, july gdp seen down 0.4% so who's gonna take the otoole points to get a discount on a car equivalent to whatever % of taxes they pay on carbon back?

the proposal is that it is (i cant remember the % but for the sake of argument we'll use arbitrary) say, a 5% tax for carbon, with some of that 5% being kept. so let's just say 3% goes to the feds 2% goes back to you. that 2% value goes into a savings account according to the proposal - not points, but an actual immediate rebate but into a special account. 

if they use a points based system then somehow we'd all need to collect points with some sort of points card? something? so that it goes into our points systems but then every single gas station would need to be on board and so would whatever else they deem falls under the \"carbon tax\" umbrella for the average person. 

or if they ask for %s, do they just ask the banks to somehow do the calculation and then give us money in a special account that is automatically opened for everyone so that when we pay with a card we get that % deposited in the special otoole green dollars or whatever so we can buy an electric lawnmower after 4 years of collecting 80$ a year from a dollar or two per tank of gas? what if you pay cash, do you keep your receipt and send it to the bank?

or is the cra gonna do it, but only if we keep all our receipts just in case we get audited after we calculate how much we spent on gas for the year? and that's just for gas stations. 

the level of coordination to ensure people get individual savings accounts where a portion of what they spend on the carbon tax is given back accurately such that we aren't just doing a blanket average person calculation and giving people money - which is what the lpc is doing - is bonkers. 

at some point along the chain someone somewhere is going to have to administer this because it is complex in nature. cash vs card payments at the pump alone will make claiming things if you use cash harder. even card payments at the pump would need the gas station to send information about how much tax was paid to the payment processor they use who then need to send that to a bank, or maybe the cra, or service canada(?) to calculate your personal tax refund, and then that refund very specifically needs to go into a tightly controlled bank account of some sort so that you can then use it to buy something from an approved list of environmentally friendly items. and that list of items is going to have to be made, vetted, kept up to date and managed by someone in the government. and then how do we spend on that list of items if we buy from a private retailer? how does the payment processor know that the 50 bucks or whatever you want to spend isn't being spent on something off the list if its just tied to your regular bank card? do we all get a special card that every retailer who sells things off this list can take only for those things? even with a special card the payment processor issue remains. or is the government going to open a green store that only takes the green card but you can order online and have it shipped to your house? what if you don't have enough in the green card account to make a full purchase? or do you ask the government or bank or whomever is holding that money to send you a special green cheque that can only be accepted for specific items at retailers? how ill they audit the retailers to make sure they aren't letting you buy things off the list?

it is straight up - super complex. and if you ignore my money issue from the previous paragraph the issue still applies to points. how will every retailer that carries an acceptable item in stock apply the points? how will they get the point value back as revenue to pay their suppliers? what companies will participate if only a handful? what if someone lives in a small town and that retailer or company isn't nearby? etc. 

or they could just only worry about the first half of how to calculate the amount spent for a 1:1 refund through the cra and give straight cash - but then that can be spent on anything, and the person using massive amounts of carbon will be paying zero carbon tax and still polluting the same as before and the green person who has an electric car will have zero refund and pay zero tax, but not be ahead at all. and the point, afaik, is to have a carbon tax, it is also to help people who pay a lot of carbon tax get off carbon. but if the cash is cra direct transfer on a 1:1 there is no incentive to change. it's just going back to pre-carbon tax days on the individual level which isn't really a good solution either. 

or they could just worry about the second half, and do what the lpc does with an average spend calculation and give people that average amount back each year but put it into the special account or points system or whatever to only spend on green things if they want to encourage less gas powered stuff and more electric motors for example. but then they still need to deal with the redemption half of the issues i thought up above.

it isn't simple and its not small government. the funny thing is the lpc model is actually very small government and is more traditionally conservative in approach than the conservative plan. average amount spent calculation done, cra gives everybody money back, people spend on what they want - and those who spend lots on carbon are net negative, those who spend little are net positive - so if you want more net positive carbon refund use less carbon. simple incentive, direct transfer, simple administration - relatively speaking. the conservatives traditionally prefer direct transfers and its why they want to give direct money to parents through a tax refund for childcare. it's straight cash people can choose how to spend via their personal responsibility.",conservatives

this probably explains the polling shift tbh, because a lot of the shift has been lpc-&gt;cpc, with the ndp having polled around 20% for some time now. i think before the election was called, covid was still the biggest issue and people trusted the liberals with it - perhaps more importantly, didn't trust the cpc. but just based on my conversations, people are tired of hearing about covid fucking 19 all the time (i know it's still an issue, doesn't mean people aren't tired of it), and the conversation has shifted more to the economy.

not significantly different for canada. we adopted a lot of their processes.

&gt;boomers have all the power?

they still have most of the wealth. they are 27% of the pop but own 50% of the wealth in canada. they also had 50 years of influence on the political landscape including shifting the structure of municipalities to allow the say to veto development.

&gt;do you know anything about japan?

sure do. tokyo has been consistently growing and most of the pr/immigrants they do accept tend to live there. what's your point? that since they don't have as many immigrants that somehow the same pop growth to the city can't be handled similarly? people moving to cities is people moving to cities. is that fact some of them are immigrants change anything? tokyo has grown consistently until 2019 even if japan has shrunk as a whole.

&gt;have you ever been to new york? they have been building sky scrapers there for more than 100 years. so yeah, their zoning rules are a bit different, mostly because they had to be all these years. it's not a new pivot for them.

as i said, they shifted to building up because a consultation process didn't exist when they had to. that's specifically my point, for a city to take that step and keep growing it needs to start building up.

the long term health of a major city needs to pivot to density. otherwise they'll sprawl out like la and that's not an option for to and van. 

&gt;oh, do you have a single detached home with a yard? if so, why? you seem to think that everyone in large cities should have to live in apartments, why not you? isn't that the solution you are going on and on about? why shouldn't everyone get the single detached home with a yard, driveway and swimming pool in the backyard?

i made choices to work from home. i don't commute. i opted for living much further away from the metro core in exchange for affordability and large sqft.

affordable, centrally located, big. it's realistic to choose 2 of those 3 at best. to allow at least 2 of the 3 we have to change the zoning in the city cores. single detached don't belong there. if we don't address that then the cities will continue to choke on the problem of a lack of homes and you won't even get 2/3 of affordable, centrally located, big. there is no way to get even 2/3 without some denser building.",liberals

communitarianism isn’t extremely common in canada today. communitarianism stresses that we all have responsibilities to each other and to society. a communitarian might see someone as a father, worker, anglican and canadian rather than just as an individual. a communitarian would see his life more in reference to his church, his family, his job and his community rather than just as an individual. a communitarian sees society in terms of groups rather than individuals, so he would see something like the degradation of marriage or the church as bad for these groups that hold society together.

i wouldn’t say this is the dominant philosophy of the conservative party of canada today. there’s two big schools, the western reform individualist school out west and a more moderate liberal conservative tory form in ontario and the east. the moderates in ontario and the east are more influenced by communitarianism, but aren’t really anymore.",conservatives

 &gt;in our political system, parliament is supposed to be supreme. mps are supposed to act as a check on government. their role is to hold ministers to account in parliament. they have the power to defeat a government on a simple majority vote on a confidence bill or motion. and the governor general is supposed to be the protector of that constitutional order, including parliament’s rights.

&gt;but when the governor general is called on, the result is that the prime minister is supreme—not parliament.

take this piece of foolishness right here. you're going to be absolutely and utterly floored when you find out that the prime minister is, in fact, a member of parliament, and, in fact, serves at the confidence of the house.

see, i sort of get the impression here that there's this hyper partisan disconnect with writers like this, where they don't seem to grasp that the ability of the pm to call upon the gg to dissolve parliament is a power he has as pm, and he's the pm due to him holding the confidence of the house. if he didn't, he wouldn't be the pm and the whatever party we're talking about wouldn't form the government. it doesn't matter if one party has a majority of the seats or not, the government still lives and dies by having the confidence of the house. its simply that in a majority situation you'd expect that the leader's party is going to support him on a confidence matter.

but it doesn't have to. as unlikely as it might be, a majority government parliament could have their own party vote against the government and bring it down. 

fundamentally what is being said here is *incoherent*. if the lpc minority government survives a confidence vote, it means the opposition parties have confidence in the government. it means the parliament has confidence in the government and in pm, which in turn is what grants him or her *that legitimate power to request that the gg dissolve parliament.*

i called it a hyperpartisan disconnect above because at the end of the day, trudeau has this power because parties, like the ndp, and mps, like singh, have agreed that the government has their confidence. ultimately, this is something they have to own, they can't insist that the gg suddenly override someone who derives his legitimate powers from the democratic process because he's using (or might use) those powers in a way that doesn't benefit your party.

i'm not sure exactly what more wells expects from these trudeau/biden confabs. biden is not obama, and his relationship with trudeau isn't going to have the same fanfare as the \"bromance\" of 2016. the world has changed a *lot* since then, and biden has his own problems to deal with back home. canadians are probably just happy that the phone call was cordial at all, and didn't involve a psychotic narcissist threatening trade sanctions or even a hot war with ottawa over an impromptu standup routine at buckingham palace or a meme rumour about trudeau directing the cbc to delete a 10-second cameo from a macaulay culkin film.

i think there's a distinct difference between the promise of the internet as a marketplace of free ideas where discourse and exchange are moderated through the masses and what we have today. 

the promise of the internet has been perverted in many spaces and we should be setting limits on the ability for tech giants to set the rules for people without the transparency and non-profit motives of the government. 

in an alternative to any form of regulation we could seek to make these companies completely transparent and remove all profit motive so they aren't incentivized to create polarized levels of engagement to keep eyes on screens, but that's not really all that feasible either. 

trying to find reasonable limits through regulatory measures is the best solution because at least the thinking and the resulting regulations can be scrutinized like every other government policy and the populace has the power to hold the elected officials to account. the monopoly power some tech giants have in the internet space means there's no practical way to do the same to them as individual people especially in a globalized landscape.",liberals

&gt; may had her flaws—and kookiness—but she was a leader and was able to galvanize support from across the party. she was also adept and keeping focus on the big picture and extinguishing in-fighting over niche issues.

sounds like the same excuses i hear for conservatives and their weird members but sure. none of that lead to seats so seems kind of moot.

&gt;paul, meanwhile, has shown herself to be a boss rather than a leader. when accused of being uncooperative and bullying she made a puzzling and frankly cringing counter-accusation of racism and sexism rather than having met the accusations head on. and rather than having taken those accusations as a serious wake-up call that an adjustment in her management style was required, she’s doubled down with her stubbornness and is attempting to purge rather than unite.

so i’d this the mess you are referring too? this seems out of place for someone who’s a support or maybe i thought it would have more meat on the accusations.  can you honestly say her claims or accusations of racism are completely unfounded? seems that rhetoric is exactly what would lead to the environment she’s describing, and that many others of other parties have described too.

&gt;unfortunately for paul, she lacks the support needed to purge her enemies. this will probably draw out until she loses the next election, likely leaving the green party in shambles, and the rest of us will be left to pick up the pieces.

for a party to be in “shambles” wouldn’t that require them to be in a better position to fall from? sounds like the green party voted for someone or something they didn’t research enough on or can’t be bother with the possibility that paul’s claims are correct.",conservatives

agree. very annoying and they should have run a nomination (even lewis previously said she didn't want it handed to her). 

nominations are often controversial though. members should really improve the candidate selection process at the next agm, and take power in nominations back from leadership.

listen to me very carefully.  trudeau will leave this country so badly damaged that you will be in your 40's or 50's before the damage is fully undone. the fiscal nightmare will come home to roost in ways you can't even imagine at your age. i have seen it with the last trudeau in the 80's, and this is going to be worse. 

you will be too inexperienced to know this but the party has a lot of power over the leader. there is plenty of time to address specific issues that concern you. and there is never going to be the perfect leader. if you wait for that you'll spend your whole life living under the liberals. 

so here's what you do. you make 100 percent sure that justin is gone. period. that's job one if you want to have an economic future. 

then you begin to find like minded people who have the same concerns you do and same values, and you work towards making sure those concerns and values are represented in the party. i can help you with that in more detail if you like or when the time comes, just msg me. 

then moving forward you attend the conventions and you help build policy etc. 

but you will completely screw up the next 20 years of your life if you allow justin to stay in. i'm not kidding you, i'm not exaggerating, i'm not talking about some nebulous ideological issue here or just that they'll do things you don't like. we are on track for a very bad bout of hyper inflation and personal/provincial/federal debt the likes we have never seen at a time of rising interest rates, and you are going to get hammered beyond belief.  won't affect me so much, ive paid my debt off, i have my home, i own my car and truck, etc. but it will clobber you.

every time the liberals talk about this, they up this number. it's reached the point of simply being an outright lie, in my view. here is the reality (pbo).

the suggestions in the article come up a bit short for me. sure taxing speculation is a no brainer and it's frankly atrocious that the government hasn't moved on that yet. but it's going to take a lot more than that to bring housing prices down. we need a way more ambitious affordable housing program, we need reforms to urban planning rules tied to federal funding and we need to end massive tax privileges for real estate like the capital gains expemption.",liberals

this is the way the debate has been reframed. rather than people calling out others for saying abhorrent things, a whole bunch of right wing grifters are complaining that their views are being silenced - essentially reclaiming the status of victimhood from people who - let's just say - are \\*actually\\* disadvantaged within society.

conservative movements, and frankly, cable news - have taught two things. conservative movements have been implicitly teaching people that any kind criticism is a violation of freedom of speech. cable news has taught us by always having two people of opposing sides on, that every opinion is just as valid as the next despite what the actual facts may be.

so, yeah, the conservative movement has been fighting a culture war against things like gay/trans marriage equality saying it'll ruin their marriages and besides, they don't actually exist. those groups also face shockingly high levels of violence vs the normal population. the conservative movement doesn't recognize structural biases that work against people of different ethnicities - we have statistics proving that these folks are very underrepresented and suffer higher levels of poverty. 

people who oppose moving to recognize and help fix these disparities should absolutely be criticized. it's how our whole system should work.

no one. no one is entitled to be above criticism.

let's just reflect on how truly scary this is. there is a large group of people who, a) feel they're victimized b) feel they're better than the people who are criticizing them c) have been made to believe that there shouldn't be consequences for what they do and how they feel.

&gt;there is no example that i have ever heard of where medical group that stands to profit off providing abortion services 

\"private insurance and out-of-pocket health services revenue

for many patients, their private insurance coverage pays for services at planned parenthood health centers. others may not use any insurance at all, and instead pay out-of-pocket for their health care. many planned parenthood health centers have a sliding-scale fees system, based on the patient’s income, to help make care more affordable. since we’re a non-profit, the revenue from these visits goes directly to fund health centers and programs, so  we can continue providing care and education to our patients.\"

non/not for profit does not mean there isn't money being made. same for ccfr and other such not for profit orgs. then using revenue to fund their health centres is the exact same thing as any other business. 

&gt;has poured money into lobbying and grass roots activism.

\"a leader in the fight for reproductive health, access, and rights

planned parenthood has 17 million supporters nationwide — activists and donors committed to helping us promote policies that protect and advance access to a full range of sexual and reproductive care and education. the planned parenthood action network engages activists in all 50 states to stay on top of the issues and get involved with campaigns that advance and protect access to reproductive rights and health.

the planned parenthood action fund — an advocacy and political arm of planned parenthood federation of america — is an independent, nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization; it  champions policies that expand people's access to medically accurate care and education as well as the freedom to make their own decisions about sexual and reproductive care. the action fund engages in educational and electoral activity, including public education campaigns, grassroots organizing, and legislative advocacy.\"

whether or not you believe the cause of each organization is equal, they both make money off of services and pour money into activism for their services.",liberals
