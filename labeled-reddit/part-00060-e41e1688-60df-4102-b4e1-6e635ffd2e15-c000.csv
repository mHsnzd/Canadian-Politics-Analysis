there's not really anyway the liberals could have met the 2020 target considering the lack of action from previous governments. in some ways i agree with you though. 40% below 2005 levels, while an improvement and more consistent with doing our part, seems like a bit of a low bar considering most of their already implemented and proposed policy will get us close to it. i could be wrong but i believe i read somewhere that 45% below 2005 levels would be more consistent with the stretch goal of keeping warming below 1.5° by 2100 so ideally we strengthen the goal to that or better down the road.",liberals

in this case, in reply to a tweet where jwr expressed sadness about the 1300 dead children found in the last month and asked trudeau to meet his promises to indigenous people from the last election before going for another one, bennett suggested she was bringing this up because she just wants more money for herself, which falls into that trope.

that was anti-scheer. nobody cared that he was catholic. they cared that he had a slimey, sleezey and underhanded way of constantly lying through his teeth about everything just to get what he wanted.

the abortion discussion came up because scheer refused to silence the party members about it. and he historically votedhimself in favour of supporting banning it.

similar thing went for his anti-lgbqts2+ stance. he was acused of being homophobic, and a threat to the rights and freedoms of lgbqts2+ people because he refused to silence party members who spoke against it. he himself having spoken against it in the past as well (comparing gay marriage to a dog's tail) and refusing to apologize

it was not anti-catholic for the lpc to point out these inconsistencies and quite disgusting behaviour by scheer.

i agree though that carbon tax is probably not the best (and certainly isn't the only) policy to pursue to take action on climate change. it's frustrating that our policy discussion is frozen in this simplistic pro/anti carbon tax debate, which itself i think shows the dangers of having a group of people with influence in our society denying climate change and opposing any action, since it allows the liberals (or bc's ndp) to just take the bare minimum action or pursue policy that isn't effective and get away with it because by comparison to the party whose members don't believe climate change exists they are constantly seen as the better option no matter what and it flattens the conversation and holds us back.

this is itself kind of another version of the dynamic where the climate-deniers are allowing our government to take not enough or the wrong action and slow-roll what needs to be done. i would like to see the cpc reduced to unviable governing party until they get their act together and then hopefully we can start to have a more productive political movement on effective climate policy and the liberals and bc ndp can be seen as the ineffective laggards that they are not doing enough that they are instead of us constantly being stuck in this maddening carbon tax wedge issue debate forever.",liberals

i do think there's a big distinction among environmentalists, between:

* those with the mindset that the key to protecting the environment is to block big projects from being built
* those with the mindset that the key to protecting the environment is to build a cleaner/sustainable economy, to replace our current energy systems

the first group has often tried to block projects that are environmentally harmful (highways, pipelines, etc.) which seems to be in line with environmentalism.  but many of them, for a wide variety of reasons, also turn against projects that could be *helpful* in cutting ghg emissions (e.g. public transit projects, apartment towers, hydro dams, wind turbines, nuclear plants, electricity transmission lines...).  ultimately if we're going to transition away from fossil fuels, we'll need to build a ton of infrastructure and projects in order to have that cleaner economy.

so if we basically can't build new projects and infrastructure, then we'll stuck with the infrastructure and energy system we have - which is mostly based around fossil fuels.

absolutely agreed, but 5 in 6 gay men have anal sex at least once a year, and something like 50% have anal sex at least weekly. i perceive increased risk from asking about anal sex alone, in that context - it relies on the majority of gay men who have anal sex to accurately report the timing of each of those instances.

and what's the gain here? so that you and the relative minority of people like you feel less unfairly treated? i'm sorry but i don't consider that a very high priority when it comes to the blood supply.

&gt;the risk assessment does not account for type of sex. and your assertion that most hiv comes from monogamous sex partners not accurate.

i didn't say most hiv comes from monogamous partners. i said that a significant amount of transmission occurs in partnerships that one partner thought was monogamous.",liberals

we're uniquely susceptible to it because (1) it only really transfers at a reasonable probability from receptive anal sex and (2) no other group has a high chance of having both roles in anal sex.  

and these two factors compound over and over to get the insane numbers you've been quoted over and over in this thread that a huge portion of our community are positive while almost no one (statistically) outside it is.  so if you have sex with 50 girls (especially since that won't be receptive anal sex with them obviously) you're chance any one of them having it is very low, and even if they did the chance of catching it would be incredibly low.  

that's just not true for us, where one random sexual incident does have a very high statistical risk of infection.

secondly, if the policy is designed properly and amortized over the life of the investment, then it would less of a problem. in your example, you sell your house for 100k more than you bought it. if you owned it for 10 years, than we simply add 10 k each year to your tax burden. you may pay initially at time of sale, but you would get a large chunk of that back at tax time that year (as it is income tax). if you are in a higher tax bracket, you would get less of that tax back. now if that house was sold for 100k more after only one year, then you would have a much higher tax burden, but their is much more evidence you are simply using it as an investment and therefore should definitely be taxed on that income.

thirdly, an inheritance tax is a very good idea. any right winger believing in self made lies of the upper class should agree with the idea that the children of the rich should have to prove themselves in the market to earn their worth. why should kids of rich people be given a pass to be as wealthy as their parents when they have not proven their value to society. peoples worth is related to what society values them to be, is that not right? is that not how conservatives view the world?

the artificially high dollar decimated the ontario manufacturing sector, which doesn't just rebound like commodity prices can. 18 year olds were making 200k a year in alberta just to be broke 10 years later after oil prices crashed. meanwhile, with this \"great economy\" harper still had to raid wcb and have a fire sale of federal assets to squeek in a balanced budget on his last year of office. all because he threw a wrench in the well oiled machine he was handed from martin. he could have just hit autopilot and canada would be in a better situation.

relevant mandatory minimum penalties and requiring
police and crown prosecutors to consider diverting
individuals out of the criminal justice system.


on one hand if its actually being done for low risk and first time offenders, that's great, i can support this but the way things are going in reality lately, this is the case for every crime that isn't serious. they are basically requiring courts to consider any option that isn't jail and at first they were blaming covid for it, but that's going to be the way forward under the liberals by the looks of it. so they arrest someone for a crime, say someone broke into a business, is arrested, they are released on a promise to appear, they go to court and the court is mandated by the feds to try not to put them in prison. 

we're living in a society that no longer has consequences for crimes. going to jail for crimes is no longer a thing in canada under the liberal government, unless it's a very serious crime. 

and the thing is, they want to encourage this, because a lot of the time the minor crimes are by indigenous people so they say okay that person has indigenous ancestry so they can be let off. i'm not making this up, this is a very real thing happening. 

or if they happen to be addicted to drugs, the court will refuse to send them to jail and instead give them probation, which they violate of course, but still don't go to jail.",liberals

however, if the government had a referendum on prop rep vs fptp i would be supportive. firstly, it would be a way to balance the discrepancy in voting power between regions such as how atlantic canadian votes are technically worth more than b.c./alberta as their ridings have smaller populations. if this was prevented as part of a two part amendment to the constitution this could be designed to fail by 3 provinces refusing to go along with it.

quebec and atlantic canada would never support it which would make it fun to see their populations turn on the libs/ndp for what they consider such a popular idea causing the referendum to fail. it would be fun to see the libs and ndp attempt to pander to try to come up with some formula that would continue to systematically see these provinces overrepresented and others unrepresented while arguing for proportional representation. not only are different groups not equal based on skin, but some people would be more proportional than others when it comes to voting. the hypocrisy would be insane.

secondly, a smart conservative leader would make this referendum have a second question asking canadians to make it so that the voting system can only be determined by national referendum which would prevent governments from messing with the voting system to try to rig it in their favor such as the liberals wanted to do with mmr style voting back in 2015 and put this stupid debate to rest as canadians would almost certainly support this question. maybe a conservative leader would be bold enough to do this who knows!?",liberals

i think people attributed government inaction to close borders fast enough with this woke ideology, since you had officials saying not to worry about it at that stage while people were screaming for the borders to close; then they were rather patronizing with how they addressed xenophobia, which did not ease concerns and solidified the narrative that the government was more concerned about their woke politics than keeping people safe. for example, [here is a tweet from teresa tam](https://twitter.com/cpho_canada/status/1222704579172864002?s=19) back in january. on top of that, a lot of people conflate the media with the government (because they are all supposedly leftwing /s).",liberals

this brings up the bigger question of *why* did they imply it even though they obviously knew it’d make them look silly? simple, it was still better optics than the truth.

the lpc didn’t want to stop foreign travel from china because they feared retribution from the ccp, and it wasn’t until everybody closed all borders they finally felt like they could follow suit.

additionally, it would seem to me that efficiency is less of a concern than end-to-end cost, and given that batteries are rapidly approaching the point where most of the cost is the material inputs, the day will come where one can no longer reliably expect learning to deliver such significant cost declines as has happened over the previous decade. the iea says as much when its landmark materials intensity study released earlier this year noted that current and planned mining activities are insufficient to provide the material inputs for the coming ev wave, even given a new push for recycling.

i therefore would caution that we may need clean alternatives to bevs to sustain the needed pace of decarbonization, despite their clear advantages, in addition to the many other more promising roles for hydrogen. the more options we have the better chance we have to decarbonize by 2050.

ps. in addition to efficiency and well to wheels costs one has to consider the cost of capital stock turnover. that is to say, instead of having to buy an entirely new bev car to decarbonize, small modifications to engines could see them burning ammonia (from the clean hydrogen) instead, which while imperfect (more nox emissions, more dangerous handling) provides a less financially daunting alternative to clean up your vehicle. the same holds true for electrification in other harder to decarbonize sectors when compared to hydrogen.",liberals

so with pfizer, the difference in your risk of hospitalization with one dose vs two is practically negligible, but according to the author this is supposed to be evidence that our longer dose interval strategy was a *bad* decision? talk about \"spin doctors\".

yes, the difference for az shots is admittedly larger at 71% effective with a single dose and 92% for two doses. but the data on dosing intervals with this vaccine suggests that [a longer interval between shots is actually better at conferring immunity](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/piis0140-6736(21)00432-3/fulltext), and [people were upset when the government actually *shortened* the interval.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/10-weeks-or-12-expert-says-slight-difference-in-astrazeneca-dosing-interval-likely-negligible-1.5443881)

the take home message here should be that **a single dose of** ***any*** **vaccine** ***significantly*** **reduces your chances of becoming sick enough with covid to require hospitalization**. at the end of the day, this is what we really care about.

was going with the longer dose interval was somewhat risky? maybe, but all the data seems to be suggesting that taking that risk has paid off.",liberals

i don't want to downplay the fact that racism and sexism are part of life for visible minorities and women in canada. i don't doubt that annamie paul has faced difficulty in public life as a black woman, and it's true that oftentimes women in politics are held to an unreasonable standard and criticized for small things.

but this is not one of them, it's shitty leadership on her part, plain and simple. her handling of the atwin affair shows that she has failed to fulfill her role.

her personal position on the israel/palestine question isn't even my problem. in fact, my position is probably closer to paul's than atwin's - but ultimately, it doesn't really matter what the fifth-largest party in canada thinks about a conflict in the middle east. but when a party executive threatens your caucus members, you fucking stand up for your team. that's what leaders do. if atwin calling israel an apartheid state was too far for the green party, it's the leader's responsibility to sit down with her, have a private conversation, and sort things out. but you don't let an unelected executive undermine your mp's political career, that's completely out of line on the executive's part, and it's your job as leader to draw that line in the sand. if paul thought atwin's position was out of line with the party's values, it's on her to have that conversation.

i don't doubt that atwin's floor crossing was at least somewhat opportunistic. at the end of the day, if atwin wanted to leave, she would have left. but there's evidence to suggest that she was pushed out at least in part by a party executive who was betraying his party by threatening to unseat two of its three mps, fucking unheard of. and if you won't stand up for the people you lead, you don't deserve to lead, plain and simple. so yeah, i can understand why the party insiders wanted to push her out, and it seems like there were legit reasons that cannot be shrugged off as racism and sexism.

i do wonder how they'll screen us out while pretending not to.  can't get around the fact that many sexually active gay men should in fact not be donating blood.  there is a fundamentally different attitude to promiscuity.  about a quarter to 1/3rd of gay men are in open or polyamorous relationships, about equal in proportion to the number of those in monogamous relationships.  (the remainder are single.)  at least going by recent us and canadian studies.  this compares to a few percent of heterosexuals.

after we've changed to whatever we change to and the new data is in and shows a quarter or half of gbq men are not eligible in practice, is that effective result still homophobic?

we won't know unless and until that situation occurs. thankfully these kinds of incident are relatively rare. 

&gt; the entire muslim community would be scrutinized as they are constantly for their faith and culture as \"minorities\" who have to somehow prove their worth in order to be included as canadians.

i dont recall any of that happening after the danforth shooting. 

&gt;there's no ownership of the radicalization of conservatives in canada or north america as a whole from these parties. grow up.

why would any political party take \"ownership\" of murderers? if you haven't advocated or encouraged murder then you dont have any \"ownership\" of it. 

&gt;muslims \"have to answer\" to denounce it and continue to prove how harmless they are like many minorities, whereas for a white (likely conservative but i'll wait to understand the whole picture as anyone should) extremist can do this and some conservatives feel he is an exception to white society, and that is \"innocent until proven guilty\".

this is complete conjecture on your part, and completely at odds with reality. muslims did not \"have to answer\" for the danforth shooting. any effort to understand the shooter's motives beyond \"mental health\" were largely decried as racism and \"islamophobia\". not a single politician even intimated that it might have been terrorism because they know that implying a brown skinned person did terrorism will result in the media attacking them for racism. 

whereas now, with this white guy, every politician across the country, and the investigating police force, couldn't even make it 24 hours before deciding that, yes, this was definitely terrorism. 

its not 2005 anymore. this fantasy about the family guy meme is long dead. violent white killers are not treated better by the media than violent brown killers. the danforth shooter was immediately deemed a \"mental health\" issue whereas this guy was immediately deemed a terrorist.

its a privilege to have your crimes absolved due to \"mental health\".",conservatives

correct, the covering. it need not be via a niqab, or hijab, etc.

a lot of people call for proportional representation, but it isn't the ideal system it might seem.


**imagine if the ppc had 5% of the seats in parliament -- that's 17 seats!**  


the ppc are polling at even more than that right now.

plus, i bet there are a lot of closet ppc supporters who currently vote conservative, but would vote ppc if they knew the ppc would get seats out of it.

so the ppc would be even more powerful than 17 seats. and they would do a lot of damage to canada the bigger they get.

---

also, what would happen under proportional representation is that the parties would fractionalize into a bunch of different parties, and then you don't exactly what you're voting for, because the government then gets formed via backroom deals the parties make after the election.

this article by a former ndp strategist highlights some problems:

https://thetyee.ca/opinion/2016/08/16/proportional-representation-in-canada/

in australia:

&gt; **australia’s one nation party now holds four seats and the balance of power in that country’s senate** – making centre-right liberal prime minister malcolm turnbull dependent on senators like malcolm roberts, **who has suggested that climate change is a “scam”** created by “corrupt” united nations reports and international banks.

&gt; **turnbull’s other unlikely allies are** three senators from the nick xenophon team – named after its leader, a group labour party deputy leader tanya plibersek described as a **“rag-tag bunch of crackpots.”** xenophon himself is known for publicity stunts like wearing pajamas to an all-night legislative session and adamantly campaigning against both poker machines and wind turbines.



in italy:

&gt; italy is another country with a proportional representation electoral system – and **enormous instability.** its **parliament has been forced to dissolve eight times in the past 40 years due to coalitions disintegrating.**

in israel:

&gt; and the consequences can be not comic but tragic in a country like israel, writes alex bain in an article for the middle east institute: “israeli politics is notable for its wide array of parties and unstable coalition governments. the main institutional cause of this chronic instability is the system of nationwide proportional representation, which **gives disproportionate influence to minor parties,”** bain says. 

and overall:

&gt; **but whatever system of proportional representation is used, minority governments, unstable coalitions, bizarre candidates and backroom dealing politics are common.**
--


&gt; this disturbing possibility is already a reality in many countries with proportional representation electoral systems, including italy, israel and australia – where single-issue, religious fundamentalist, anti-immigrant and personal vanity parties regularly must be courted to create a coalition government.


some people cite scandinavian countries as places where proportional representation maybe works, but they're small countries with small populations. canada is very diverse and vast, and having a lot of different parties could open-up fissures in canadian society (even worse than what's currently happening).

---



ranked ballots are a better system, because it:

- force parties and their platforms to try to gain the support of as many canadians as possible. it forces compromise that way, at the party/platform level.

- and it would force the conservatives to stop being so extreme, because they would need to try to be the 2nd choice of voters. and they would choose more moderate leaders.

- it also helps people know what they're voting for.

in contrast, proportional representation:

- fractionalizes parliament into a lot of different parties... including crackpot parties.  

- and then we would have to simply hope that the parties manage to compromise together, but it gives too much influence to minor (or even crackpot) parties. 

- and people won't be sure what they're voting for, because the parties will have to cut backroom deals in order to form government. that's where the compromise is in this scenario, but you don't really know what you'll get.",conservatives

yep, and the eucharist is just snacks with friends unless you believe in transubstantiation. it is the exact same thing, it is religiously imposed modesty.

if your idea is correct, if the specific garment isn't a requirement, in that it isn't religious, then why don't religious muslim women simply dress in non-religious clothing that fits the same criteria? it would fulfill the obligations of bill 21 and their religious obligations.

&gt;nope. a relevant comparison would be mormon's requirements about modesty. it is simply that their requirements fit into what fashion is seen as acceptable.

which is, again, religious. your mormon example doesn't really work anyways since their rules are considerably more relaxed. there is no religious clothing that is required that can be seen. therefore, the religious aspect of it is private. the only way it wouldn't be is if mormons prothelisized during their duty, which is already outlawed, and not just in quebec.

&gt;so if the liberals and cpc come together to impose a ranked ballot through parliment, you will accept that?

this is a question of, how do we protect the rights of a minority in parliament? when it comes to the barest of essentials, such as how we conduct our voting, what rights need to be protected that are otherwise not protected in things such as the charter? 

while i wouldn't necessarily prefer that voting system, i would probably not leave the country or otherwise not accept the ruling of the majority because of faith that if the majority were to try to impose themselves on me in ways i would not find acceptable, there are mechanisms to protect me. we live in a democracy, sometimes things won't go my way, especially if i (knowingly) hold opinions that a majority of people don't always agree with. 

i think there are quite a lot of people who have been getting what they wanted out of the political system for a long time who are just unable to come to terms with the fact that they are no longer part of the political majority in this country and are willing to do anything to hold onto that. if you are pro-democracy, you have also have to accept when you lose and lick your wounds instead of (likely) putting yourself in a worse position by not *accepting* the results, through emigration or rising up against the government. calls to not respect our parliamentary democracy fall into this category.",liberals

no, i think the psychological literature is full of ways that we can convince ourselves that something is true when it is convenient to us. i make no claim that anyone is lieing. lieing is one mechanism. various psychological biases and motivated reasoning are other mechanisms. i don't distinguish between mechanisms. i only make a claim about the *outcome*, which is again, incentive based.

&gt;you predict all people are like that (as i am of course assuming you don't mean only indigenous people are always like that).

not all, but the vast vast vast majority yes. people respond to incentives. that's been proven over and over and over in basically every single context. and indigenous people are people, so yes, they respond to incentives like any other group would. white, black, male, female, gay, trans. they all respond to incentives.

&gt;i have no prediction. i simply pointed out that it isn't a \"never going to happen\"

hcdu3zm,2021-09-10T11:18:12.000-07:00,"trudeau says he would leave canadian flags at half-mast if re-elected what's actually happening that people continue to mischaracterize is that justice canada is fighting a court case related to the jurisdiction of the canadian human rights tribunal, which, they argue, doesn't have jurisdiction to tell parliament what to do in the way it did.

the chrt was created by law, it is a tribunal, not a court. and by making the judgement it did, it was effectively ruling on a class action lawsuit but the tribunal isn't set up to do that. it also doesn't have the jurisdiction to tell parliament what to do since it's a statutory body (created by the legislative branch of government and under it, therefore not part of the judicial branch of government).

it's all very technical and legal specific, but it boils down to the fact that if the supreme court decides the tribunal did act within its jurisdiction and that it does hold some power over parliament (even the supreme court doesn't when you get right down to it) then it opens a giant can of worms.

it also means that the feds wouldn't be able to negotiate alternative settlements with individual first nations - they'd be forced to give the 40k to individuals and effectively be done with it, and if the fns wanted a different solution they wouldn't be allowed to get it. all because a tribunal created by a law created by the feds stopped the feds from engaging in nation to nation discussions, which on the face of it, is a pretty bad example of hands being tied through colonial vestiges under the law. 

it's horribly complicated and reductive \"you're taking kids to court\" really don't help when it's actually a matter of jurisdiction and the specific judgements are a byproduct rather than the intent of the court case. my basic understanding of the law makes me think the fed gov will probably be successful in its supreme court review application. i hope they do in fact still address the underlying problem the tribunal ruled on, but i can see why having a tribunal be able to pass judgement on the federal government with and in issues amounting to class action lawsuits would be a jurisdictional nightmare in the long run.",liberals

damn. people can't discuss anything in good faith. put words in my mouth much? i didn't say anything close to trusting monopolies to do the right thing. do you think that it is possible to not trust companies or the government in this particular space? one just costs us tax money and essentially censors content while the other puts profit ahead of everything, including 'canadian culture.'

in terms of cases and deaths per capita, we are nowhere near places like the uk, us, or italy, let alone places like brazil and india. we never had our healthcare system collapse or be overwhelmed like we saw in italy and parts of the us. out of the major countries in the g20, our response has been pretty good. yeah some island countries had an unfair advantage and were able to stomp it down, but considering canada's interwovenness with the world epicentre for a year (the us) we blew them out of the water.

mistakes were made. people in long term care suffered, and to a major degree that probably couldn't be helped, they are by definition the most vulnerable in this situation. its a shame, reforms must be made, but still, overall it wasn't so bad on the general public from a case/death perspective.

no, it's because canadians don't want to waste their votes. parties (&amp; independent candidates) seen as not having a chance getting elected *due to past precedent*, get a further penalty because the voters who *would* choose them (in a perfect world, *i.e.* one with ranked choice voting) vote strategically for one of the three/two \"most likely to be elected\" parties. 

if i love the green party &amp; believe a conservative party government would be *very bad* for the things that i care about, but i know that the conservative party might win with 35% due to vote splitting, i would look to the party or candidate who is most likely to defeat the conservative candidate. the same is true for conservatives and alternative right-wing political options.
