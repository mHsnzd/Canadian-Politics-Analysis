jagmeet also doesn’t appear to have a good understanding of what his jurisdiction is as the federal government. making broad statements about changes he will make where there feds have no right to cross provincial lines.

 i'm ambivalent to the broader geopolitical goals of becoming a more populace country. in part because canada isn't generally interested in geopolitics, so i don't see how being able to be a bigger player is relevant when we choose to be a smaller player than we could as is. 

i believe wage impacts are primarily redistributive with net impacts being small. i don't believe we have ever made an attempt to address the redistributive impacts (infrastructure spending might do this, however). 

i think the consequences of not building infrastructure to match is negative and profoundly redistributive. if we built infrastructure to match, it probably won't be my top issue but i'm on board. but the plan of increasing immigration without even talking about building more public infrastructure while actively curtailing private infrastructure? it's absurd. 

by the same token, if someone is pro-immigration but doesn't want any new transit lines, doesn't want any new subdivisions, doesn't want any increase in density, doesn't want any daycares (e.g. tiff macklem), schools, or hospitals, well i don't think they can really claim to be pro-immigration. those things go along with population growth.",liberals

look—as i’ve said, we don’t disagree on the need for a principled conservative economic policy.  but—surprise surprise—presenting that platform to the public without it being read as “cuts! cuts! cuts!” is not straightforward, because canadians are very attached to certain entitlements.

i do think the butcher’s bill will come due in the next year or so and voters will begin to feel the squeeze at home, and so it may be the time to reach them.  while economic priorities poll high now, they’re not real to most voters—except those presently receiving direct cash from the government.

your disingenuity regarding the present discourse in this sub on how “right” the party should go makes further dialog pointless.

o’toole is hardly “left” economically.",conservatives
hehgf5e,2021-09-27T01:55:00.000-07:00,"canada voted, but your vote may not count. again the argument in favour of proportional representation (pr) is that first-past-the-post (fpp) voting systems do not work well at all when you have multiple parties.  someone who leans left on social issues might vote ndp or liberal, and be very opposed to the conservative party.  if you had 40% conservative and %60 liberal, you would get a liberal rep.  if you had 40% conservative, 30% liberal, and 30% ndp, you get a conservative representative.  does a system truly work as intended when the elected politician is opposed by 60% of the voters?

the secondary issue (which may or may not be a problem based on your point of view) is that fpp grants more weight to regional parties than their vote percentage might justify, and shuts out parties with low percentage of the vote spread out across the nation.  canada ends up with a viable example of both flaws.

the bq always end up with more seats than their percentage of vote share would suggest.  this works great for separatist voters in quebec.  but it does not reflect the will of the canadian population as a whole.  and the green and now ppc parties have legit support across the nation, but always a low vote share. does shutting them out of parliament serve anyones interests?

ultimately, i would like to see proportional representation happen because it will make majority governments much less common.  i think every ones interests would be better served if the parties were actually forced to figure out how to accommodate one another rather then spend all their time trying to shut one another out of the process.

first, explaining mixed member proportional representation, single transferable vote (small regions), etc. is turning out to be really hard. \"rank the candidates in order of preference, that's it.\" was nine words.

second, there are people that want a parliament to be proportionally representative and there are people that really want to keep local representation. from your first link:
&gt; the greater the district magnitude (number of members per constituency), the greater the proportionality, as the entire range of voters’ party preferences would be more accurately reflected. the trade-off that comes with increased district magnitude is less local representation. given the preferences expressed throughout the committee’s study for strong, accountable local representation, any introduction of proportionality in canada would need to maintain a district magnitude that would not unduly dilute local representation.

a lot of people, myself included, want to keep local representation because we feel that we are more easily able to hold them to account. for example, there were lots of candidates that had to drop out of the election due to scandals unacceptable to local constituents. if instead we're pulling from lists of party candidates, then we are solely dependant on party apparatus to keep xxxx-ists out of elected office.

third, where do the candidates come from? part of the local representative is being able to hold them personally accountable. any system that draws from lists of candidates and requires people to vote for a party over a person loses a lot of legitimacy in the eyes of some voters. they weren't chosen by voters, they were chosen by backroom special interests.

fourth, the gallagher index is a very useful tool but it shouldn't be wielded like a magic hammer. i voted \"not conservative\" in the past five elections (provincial and federal). how well does the gallagher index account for my \"not conservative\" choice? that's right, it doesn't. no matter how pure the academic literature is, if it can't account for the lived experience of voting canadians then it can be quickly waved away.

fifth, i'm still holding on some naive delusional hope that the liberals and the ndp can actually work together. there are a lot of people that were hoping for another liberal minority government where they had to work with the ndp. stupidly, i still think that if we had a ranked choice ballot then we could see them not entirely shit over each others platforms. singh might have gained votes by attacking trudeau and dismissing liberal achievements as nothing, but he also lost votes by doing it. he lost mine.",liberals

i see nigel farage as being something similar to maxime bernier. maybe some small percentage people in a population would vote for people like that but it's unlikely people would want guys like that representing their community. i see these types as just grifters, and if they can get a few seats, they can use those seats to gain more notoriety spreading their bullshit further. having the check that you can't sit in parliament if you can't convince a plurality of the people in your hometown to vote for you keeps out the riff raff. why should someone that can get a few votes here and there across the country get into parliament when the people in their hometown, the people that know them best, know them to be a bullshit grifter?

ultimately, politics isn't a mathematical problem with optimal solutions. you've got issues which much of the public doesn't fully understand, you've got parties and candidates that the public doesn't know very well. in any system you're going to have people voting against their own self interests because they don't know that's what they're doing. most of the government is really a bureaucracy, most things will run the same way regardless of who's elected. given all of this, what's the point of democracy? to put a check on those in power. you're seeing a fptp system factoring out the the people you want to get elected, but you have to recognize that the requirement that someone at least win a plurality of the votes in their hometown serves to also keep the worst people out of parliament as well. which is why fptp is so resilient, you don't have grifters like nigel farage sitting in your parliament trying to destroy it for his own profit.

in the end, in either system we'd still have the liberals and the ndp having to agree on what legislation to pass. what specific legislation do you want that isn't going to pass in our current system that would pass in an alternate system? is having numbers line up on a spreadsheet important enough to remove an important check on who gets to sit in parliament?",liberals

well given that the only thing you've spoken to is engaging on twitter and tik tok, i'm really not sure what underlies your doubt of sincerity.  you've spoken as if using those platforms itself is somehow dumbing down politics and evidence of insincerity.  that's just not the case.  you've also made some pretty demeaning statements regarding youth engagement.  it's worth reflecting upon.

i'm not sure why you think trudeau is somehow exempt from criticism during a campaign and feel the need to label this attack without so much as a noting what you're discussing.  singh did a lot more than criticize trudeau, and i feel like you sort of know that deep down.  it demeans you to put together such a strawman.

what's unworthy negative political slogans is what you're offering here.  unspecific and unsupported criticisms that can't therefore be answered.  note the difference between that and what singh and the ndp offered during the campaign toward the current government when putting forward criticism.

as to your assertion that the ndp's engagement with the youth amounted to \"hey, we tax the rich, watch me dance!\" it's absurd and shameful.  i'm not going to even address it.  for someone complaining about the things you are, it should be beneath you if this is a good faith discussion.

if you're going to lambast people based upon the content of a tik tok post, you're doing exactly what you assert without substantive support an entire demographic and political party to be doing.  it's worth reflecting upon, and really unworthy stuff.  you've essentially said the reason you voted liberal was doubting sincerity based on tik tok posts.  just who is voting based on tik tok here?

given the already immense strain the court system is under that is a massive waste of resources. if you've received a minimum allowable sentence then your option is to appeal the verdict or accept the sentence. if you define reasonable minimums then there's no problem.

&gt;to your second point, maximum sentences are not quite equatable to minimum sentences in terms of impact on decisions (my gut feeling is minimum sentences impact far more cases than maximum), but sure if you want to do away with maximums i'm open to that discussion.

i appreciate your logical consistency. my point was simply that, logical consistency, but the removal of minimums seems to be far more a desire for leniency than giving latitude to judges.

&gt;if some judge goes rogue and sentences a shoplifter to life imprisonment for funsies they will get appealed hard and probably have their reputation dragged

this is exactly why we have explicit maximums, to avoid those issues. minimums do the same thing but from the other end, they prevent judges being too lenient and establish a baseline of acceptable punishment, and i'm of the opinion that one is not worse than the other.

even without those you would have heavy reliance on case law for sentencing, and i think it's far better to just have it spelled out directly in law.",liberals

&gt;of course now you’re talking changes to the entire way corporations have run things the last 50 years.

how so?

&gt;and what do you mean “less generous cash transfers to seniors?” are you referring to oas and cpp? as it is they really don’t get a lot.

i'm referring to oas. cpp is self funded, so it's not a cash transfer. they really _do_ get a lot actually. old age security (which goes to most seniors) and the guaranteed income supplement (for low-income seniors) will cost an estimated $81-billion in 2025. as of 2023, outlays on seniors’ benefits will be more than the canada health transfer and equalization combined. by 2025, the added costs will be almost triple the annual price tag for new spending on the proposed national child-care program. oas payments are reduced only for seniors starting at an income of about $79,000. that level exceeds canada’s average income by $30,000. and they aren't asset tested whatsoever. those benefits are, and will remain, the federal government’s biggest transfer program.

&gt;tax the ultra rich people and corporations too much and they’ll walk.

eventually, sure, but we're _well below_ the revenue maximization rate. if we have projects with a net benefit, we should fund them. (we can also fund without using tax, like printing more money instead of collecting more).

&gt;transfer payments

equalization payments are definitely needed in some small provinces who just don't have the scale to be efficient on many things. but it also creates bad incentives, and when a large province makes use of it, it's usually a problem.

we have a lot of requirements on people who get benefits like welfare. maybe needing equalization payments should be treated somewhat similarly.

in regards to just transfer payments, like the feds sending health care money, as i said we are stuck with it but we can attach conditions at least. generally though, it's bad for one level of gov to tax and another level to spend. it should be the same level doing both, which is why the feds would ideally both tax and run healthcare. but since we can't have that, i'd rather the feds maintain what control they can, even if it means they have to do the taxing.",liberals

the centre-left in ontario right now just kinda sucks. horwath gets a lot of hate on this sub, i don't personally find her that objectionable, but her political chops are severely lacking for someone with a job that could potentially be premier-in-waiting. the olp meanwhile has a similar leadership problem, on top of the fact that they're organizationally much weaker - but the \"liberal\" name will get them votes no matter what, and not being wynne will win del duca more votes and seats - but polling suggests that they're just eating into 2018 ndp voters, not pc voters. the way liberals win elections by winning just enough lib-tory swing voters while consolidating promiscuous progressives, and del duca isn't the guy to do either.

it's funny seeing new democrats making the vote-splitting argument, but i think it does make more sense for anti-ford voters in ontario to rally around the ndp than the olp. in any case, the people that decide elections in ontario only swing when they're really tired or angry with the status quo, and that does not seem to be the case right now.",liberals

the vaccine is unavailable to lots of people, and though it's very effective, some vaccinated people still get seriously ill. i also don't think we'll have a lasting reopening of society until we reach herd immunity, and vaccination is the safest way to achieve that. 

&gt; we do not have the same public health outcry against overweight people and type 2 diabetics

well, again, one's heart attack rarely kills a third party.

second, what does it matter if we're mismanaging an unrelated condition? that seems like a non-sequiter.

and third, i think you're probably downplaying how much of an impact prior conditions *do* have on healthcare decisions. i'm sure that it has an impact on transplant eligibility, for example. there are different solutions for different problems, and *heart attacks aren't currently making icu beds unavailable for trauma patients.*

&gt; if we are picking and choosing what sub group of people in society get more rights for compliance, it's an authoritarian measure.

nobody is doing that. we're all subject to a constitution that lays out prohibited grounds of discrimination. vaccine skepticism isn't one of them. the rules are the same for everyone. they just have different consequences depending on individual decisions. honestly this argument reads like \"speed limits discriminate against people who like to drive fast\".

if there's a compelling constitutional argument against vaccine mandates (there isn't), it's based on individual liberty (s. 7), not equality.",conservatives

i'm not sure how much things have changed since 2006. trudeau didn't promise to double the number of elderly immigrants who could come here before his first election, then do it again before his second election because that would be helpful to canada. quite the contrary. we don't need more elderly people lining up for health care. he did it to win votes in ethnic ridings. most of those who are opposed to increased immigration wouldn't vote for him anyway, so promising to make it easier to bring over the relatives of recent immigrants is a cheap and easy way to get votes among those groups while losing little.
