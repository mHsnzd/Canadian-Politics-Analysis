hhtctrg,2021-10-23T12:26:00.000-07:00,"conservatives, just get your shots already &gt;the vaccine is unavailable to lots of people, and though it's very effective, some vaccinated people still get seriously ill. i also don't think we'll have a lasting reopening of society until we reach herd immunity, and vaccination is the safest way to achieve that.

who is unavailable for the vaccine in canada? at this point everyone in canada who wants to vaccine has one right now. also speaking to herd immunity, the experts and scientists quoted saying we need at least 70% vaccination to reach herd immunity. meanwhile every province is the high 80s early 90% in vaccination terms so are we there? or are we moving google post to push an agenda?

&gt;well, again, one's heart attack rarely kills a third party.

second, what does it matter if we're mismanaging an unrelated condition? that seems like a non-sequiter.

and third, i think you're probably downplaying how much of an impact prior conditions do have on healthcare decisions. i'm sure that it has an impact on transplant eligibility, for example. there are different solutions for different problems, and heart attacks aren't currently making icu beds unavailable for trauma patients.

one covid infection rarely rarely kills another party when 90% is currently vaccinated. to your second point, it does matter because most of the covid deaths were due to comorbidity with another illness such as people with heart disease becoming diabetics. 

&gt;and third, i think you're probably downplaying how much of an impact prior conditions do have on healthcare decisions. i'm sure that it has an impact on transplant eligibility, for example. there are different solutions for different problems, and heart attacks aren't currently making icu beds unavailable for trauma patients.

no not in the slightest actually. most patients requiring icu care are people with heart disease that require around the clock monitoring and acute care. i'm not sure what you're argument is regarding transplants. like a transplant will reduce the load in hospitals? i'm not sure. if you could clarify that for me that would be great. 

&gt;nobody is doing that. we're all subject to a constitution that lays out prohibited grounds of discrimination. vaccine skepticism isn't one of them. the rules are the same for everyone. they just have different consequences depending on individual decisions. honestly this argument reads like \"speed limits discriminate against people who like to drive fast\".

if there's a compelling constitutional argument against vaccine mandates (there isn't), it's based on individual liberty (s. 7), not equality.

actually the provinces who have mandated vaccine passports are in fact doing that as we speak. people cannot participate in social activities such as restaurants, gyms, theaters, virtually anywhere where social gathering takes place. by law as we speak in british columbia, an unvaccinated person cannot lawfully enter a restaurant therefore it is being enforced because of their health beliefs. speeding is not comparable to not wanting a vaccine because it's not a health hazard and it's not a hazard to others. it's simply making a vehicle go faster than the government would like you to. everyone who has a vehicle in this subreddit has sped at one time in their life with no consequences. lifestyle risk due to poor diet and exercise are in fact equatable. the only reason section 7 of the charter is being overruled in court is only because a non-withstanding clause, which has been denounced by brian peckford saying he'd have never had signed it if he knew this is what the clause would have been used for. just because it's legal doesn't make it moral. vaccine skepticism does not apply in this argument. whether some cookie conspiracy theorist doesn't like vaccines for one reason or another or if a firm believer of vaccines doesn't want a vaccine neither of those people should be forced to get one for the sake of authoritarian strides, just like people who are overweight shouldn't have to go on a diet or exercise to a piece other people, even if it's for their own good.",conservatives

a nursing home having a covid cases shortly before scheduled vaccination is media catnip, but realistically it takes a few weeks to reach even 50% immunity, and then a few more weeks after the second shot to achieve full efficacy. the vaccinations being moved up a few days almost certainly wouldn't have stopped the outbreak.",liberals

i missed your reply, but this is probably sufficient in responding to your dislike of hydro-dams.

i would suggest looking into them more than you currently have. the reason is that much like nuclear fission, there are different ways to go about doing hydro. we just commonly pick the worst method because people are greedy in some form or another.

meanwhile, solar panels are going to increase the local heat dome effect of areas they are in, like how black rooftops and pavement do it in cities. that is unless we somehow find a way to capture that heat or reduce it entirely. i don't know about you, but capturing the methane released from specially made hydro-dams built to do it, is probably the better method, cause we can paint it all super-white, and reflect heat back into space as well to boot. you currently can't do that with solar power. not really. and like it or not, but we will always have a need for some natural gas in some sectors. so it's a win win.

erin o'toole is one of the moderates in the party. not as moderate as peter mackay but nowhere near as right wing as trump. if you can even call trump right wing. for many conservatives, trump is an antithesis to conservativism. 

it's not fair to call biden a \"socialist\" because of the growing socialist democrat movement in his party. because he is clearly one of the more moderate democrats. erin o'toole is like biden. he's no doug ford. and unlike down south. there is no growing movement in the conservative party. erin o'toole is a slightly more moderate version of andrew scheer.",conservatives

hknbpu1,2021-11-14T06:42:42.000-08:00,"ubc under pressure to cancel event with filmmaker who made \"the canadian mass graves hoax\" documentary | lauren southern's movie claims that there's no evidence of a catholic church cover-up again, the example you offer explicitly offers a reason other than disagreement with you for your accused racism.  even if it doesn't apply or if you disagree with the basis for it, that's fundamentally not the same as just applying it as \"because they disagree\". you might as well be suggesting the accusation is because they didn't like your shoes.  that's not what they said and you're not addressing what they said.

i haven't seen the basis for the accusation, so i have no interest in discussing that with you.  but even this is not an example of what you said earlier,  even it is completely off base.

look, you are the one \"watering\" concerns down by imagining the psychology of the person who made a comment rather than addressing the concerns raised. we all are prone to do it at times, but let's be honest about it when we do.

the act of attributing a general trend like this is just waving your hand and being dismissive of these type of accusations.  it's done without rigor, and even when asked for examples it seems more about feeling personally that an accusation against you was without merit in your view and must therefore be based simply on disagreement by your personal inference in contradiction to the reasons offered.

racism isn't in danger of being watered down.  it's real and a part of the fabric of people's lives.  the idea that one needs a kkk hood to be racist or behave in a racist manner is inaccurate..and advances us further from a better world.  accepting the things we may not have given a second thought to before may need to be reflected upon and changed rather than missing the point is where we need to be.  your argument is honestly precisely backward to what's required right now. 

there are lots of different types of racism just like there are lots of different types of lots of things.  you can be racist without being an active member in the klan.  suggesting otherwise is a real issue that you might want to reflect upon.  

doing something racist is what makes you racist.  what makes that a worse problem is when someone is okay with that and builds up reasons they shouldn't think about it rather than why they should. making it about something you saw in a movie, an extreme form of racism instead of all the other ways that makes those more blatant forms possible is harmful and counterproductive.

i don't know the details of the accusation you shared.  i just know that rather than represent it as a disputed or false claim that you were racist you represented it as someone calling you racist just because they disagree with you that you felt was part of a large trend with these particular descriptors.  you specifically likened it to someone calling trudeau racist for wearing blackface.  that's really all i can speak to. what definitely was missing was a concern for how your behaviour may have impacted others, even if it was not intended.

even after asking you for examples i can say i've never seen an example of someone calling someone any of those things just because they disagree as a way to discredit them.  i'm sure it happens from time to time, but your suggestion without evidence that there is some large trend in this regard seems unwarranted thus far and, if you'll excuse me for inferring now, part of a larger strategy to dismiss such suggestions without addressing them.",liberals
