hbjln2c,2021-09-03T17:18:25.000-07:00,"conservatives would repeal ban on guns used in école polytechnique, nova scotia mass shootings \\&gt; i'm curious why you are focusing on one specific item used during one specific crime that happened when most of us were children?

the fact is it goes beyond this one case. itcomes up here because it was discussed in the french debates, and the polytechnique was the worst of several mass shooting carried out by legal gun owners. the ruger 15 has caused quite a bit of havoc across the world:

*  anders brevik shot over 60 teenagers with it in norway. 
* last years nova scotia shotings were carried out with a ruger 14

it comes up a gain and again. 

unfortunately, these fact are suppressed by the conservative media and the left-wing media is too worried checking in on everybody's feelings to deal in hard facts, so i don't blame you for being misinformed you are about this assault weapon.  this ducment shed some light n why it keeps on being used by mass shooters: [http://polysesouvient.ca/documents/docu\\_19\\_10\\_14\\_rugermini14\\_dossier.pdf](http://polysesouvient.ca/documents/docu_19_10_14_rugermini14_dossier.pdf)

it';s basically designed for mass shootings. it's small, so it can be used at short range and pointed from target to target and can easily be hidden in a ternch coat. it's semi automatic, and a trained shooter can firs 2 or 3 round per second. the magazines can be changed quickly with practice (mass shooters go to gun ranges a lot), and even in canada you can remove a small pin from the magazine and fire 30 rounds at a time.

 \\&gt; to do this we need mental health and government systems that are trusted by canadian gun owners. gun owners need to feel safe to come forward to say \"i own a gun and i need mental help\", and they need to have a system that's ready to provide them with competent help when they ask for it.

you see we already have proof that doesn't work. alexandre bissonnette was already under the care of a psychiatrists for years and heavly medicated to control anxiety. yet he was able to purchase a cache of weapons  and joina gun club to get very good at shooting before carrying out his planned attack on the mosque. 

what we really need is mandatory, trict  mental health checks (paid for by the gn owners) before thjey purchase guns and annual mental health checks once they own them. gun owners want their guns more than anybody else and the expreience with alexandre bissonnete.

\\&gt; there are several components used to make explosives being sold in canadian tire and home depot without any kind of registration or control, yet we don't have people blowing others up all the time.

well again you have to inform yourself here. when right-wing militia terrorists carrie out the  oklahoma city bombings in 1993, they  used huge amounts of ammomnium nitrate, a fertilizer used by farmers, from an agricultural coop. as a result, in the u.s. and canada, we responded rationally and banned the sale to anyone but farmers, who need to prove how they are going to use every ounce. 

did the farmers compain about their \"right\" to buy fertilizers? did fertilizer manufacturer bay lobbiest billions of dollars to lobbby the governemnt so they could sell it to anybopdy like before? no. the followed common sense an went along with it. 

why oh why can gun owners and manufacturers not take the same common sense attitude tow\\\\ards assault rifles as problematic as the ar-15 and ruger-14?   clearly itys use needs to be restricted to people who need it like police and security guards? they shoul;d not be used as recreational toys.",conservatives

i didn't see it in your quote. so until i see that infromation and her analyss of it, i cannot be sure. she actually said she would completely dismiss the question and not bother to examine the facts. 

\\&gt; thats just not true. pump and lever actions are only marginally slower firing, and several of those have the magazine capacity to do that without reloading. 

mass shooters don;t choose those guns. they choose semi-automatic pistols and short, easily maneuvred  assault rifles designed to kill people quickly and effectively. 

alexandre bissonettes mas shooting is a good example. he managed to unload 40 bullets in a minute, reloading his glock semiautomatic 3 times. you see, a trained shooter can reload magazines extremely quickly. limits on magazine size mean nothing either  bissonnette showed up with an automatic rifle as well that had 40bullets in it because he'd simply removed the pin that restricts to 5 bullets. that restriction is a joke, really. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec\\_city\\_mosque\\_shooting#attack\\_on\\_mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_city_mosque_shooting#attack_on_mosque)

\\&gt; there are plenty of semi automatic hunting rifles and shotguns, most of them several times more powerful than the 223 ruger

you don't want power where your gunning down people in a mosque or school. you want rapid firing, easy reloading, and small size that can be easily maneuvred and concealed. you're not trying to bring down a deer with one shot at a distance. you're trying to kill a bunch of people all around you very quickly. a powerful long gun is too hard to hide on the way in, to difficult to point at the next victim, does not fire quickly enough in case someone rushes you, and the recoil makes it harder to aim at the next victim. 

that's why guys like bissinette show up a) with an assualt rifle like an ar-15 or ruger 14 and b) pistols like the glock 17. it's also why ruger  tactical training videos focus on switching between the ruger 14 and a pistol and don't feature long hunting rifles.

it turns out that terfs, conservatives, and white supremacists are natural allies, in the same way that the earlier waves of feminism [had a whole lot of shit in common with white supremacists](https://www.npr.org/2011/03/25/134849480/the-root-how-racism-tainted-womens-suffrage). sojurner truth wasn't just blazing her shown path, she was purposefully excluded from the white feminist movement.

black women.

well, i say \"got\" and \"were\" as if it's not still fucking happening, but it *is* still fucking happening and all you need to do is look at the track and field world and how it treats black women (especially the ones that win - remember that one european runner who claimed to be the \"first place white woman\"?), or have a look at how serena williams, or simone byles are treated. 

skin colour doesn't matter until the black woman wins. then they'll find a way to make you medically unfit to be in the \"women's\" category (caster semenya is the most recent and stark example, [but by no means the only one](https://www.sbnation.com/2020/4/20/21227661/caster-semenya-world-athletics-regulation-body-racism)).

i don’t think the liberals will win 9 seats today. but it wouldn’t take a whole lot for them to get there if they can get close to 2015 levels of support. especially if the ppc and maverick party take even 5% of the vote, that could flip a bunch of close seats in edmonton and calgary.",liberals

that's not a quebec thing. that should concern you no matter what province it might be happening in. the real problem is provinces with conservative governments deciding that the charter is just a piece of paper, and rights can be shredded if they are inconvenient. somehow, conservative governments, in quebec, ontario, and sometimes elsewhere, are backing away from equal rights and the rule of law.",liberals

hm5dye2,2021-11-25T20:46:53.000-08:00,"the greatest strategy i have seen yet for the cpc. conservatism in action, rather than reaction. this is specifically what i mean. ideologically one can say that the ndp is more socially democratic(which is true), but their position aids the neo liberal establishment.

the one main thing neo-liberals want is a mass of people, willing to spend as much money as possible, on as many goods as possible. 

this means that there are 2 parts of the recipe that is needed.

1. social hedonism: guess what? if people dont want to buy your stuff, especially if they dont want to buy your stuff with eagerness. they arent gonna buy it. infact if they find what you sell to be evil, they will shut you down. the free market works pretty well, if the society it is in would be mostly moral. buuuuut, what the state, corporations, universities, etc.... shove down peoples throats is this new progressive religion. it teaches you that you must seek pleasure as much as possible + care about harm reduction. this is done so that people, are willing to sell important things for a price tag. ever wonder about the only fans stuff?? women are out here selling their sexuality. your sexuality, used to be reserved for one very important person, that you loved dearly. it was a gift, that you shared with each other, that was ***priceless.*** today women are taught that, \"hey, be sexually liberated, go and be as sexual as you want, and sell your nudes on only fans for $18.\" something priceless, now being sold on the freemarket, for a couple of bucks. who benefits? not the women, they are getting ripped off, turned into sex symbols. but hey, the neo liberal system benefits. that is just more money. do you think this would work in a conservative free market? no, people would shut down anyone who tries to dehumanize women, and men like this. so the neo liberals love the leftist hedonism.
2. they need to ensure that the free markets run well, see as i said the free markets work well, when society is moral, not too well when society is hedonistic. the neo liberals must ensure that there is as much economic freedom, for them to do their dirty work. in addition, since what they sell is hedonistic. exporting it to the rest of the world, is an easy job. you dont need to do much, just show the people what is possible. destroy their home culture, and shove this down their throats.

the ndp does **part 1.** for the neo liberal state.

the lpc does **part 1, &amp; part 2** for the neo liberal state

the lpc is the best for the neo liberals, the other two arent as great. but, they will still contribute in someway, aiding the establishment.

but the bigger picture is, we do not have a gun violence epidemic. trudeau is using it as a hot button issue, without accurately explaining our firearm laws to the boarder population. he hasn't explained a single thing. a ton of the guns he banned in may of 2020 are used for hunting, but look scary.

what we do have in canada is a epidemic of social injustice, social inequality, inequity, etc. we need our officials to do is actually follow through with social reforms, and create a social safety net in our under served communities so that people don't turn to gang and gun violence, because they don't see any other option to make money, or have that social or familial connection. we need to protect vulnerable youth and families to create spaces for them to grow and thrive. our leaders have always said all these niceties but have never followed through. people do not turn to gun violence. we need to fight for complete social reform.

hm5fr6k,2021-11-25T21:06:50.000-08:00,"canada pm trudeau says he is extremely concerned by soaring cost of living i don't know if it has anything to do with just in time manufacturing, unless you mean the efficiency of the chain being for things to arrive consistently to a certain level of secondary use and direct shipping.

there's a lot of product stuck in shipping containers off the us coast. lots of stuff waiting to go into ships in china. even if chinese manufacturers all shut down for a couple days they'd still not catch up on either side of the shipping lane.

of course some things in particular facing true manufacturing shortages like chips as you say. 

opec constraining oil supply doesn't help either. they reduced production due to covid and haven't fully caught up yet to pre pandemic production levels.

it's a multifaceted issue as you point out but that doesn't mean we can't eventually get back to pre pandemic supply chain eventually. just not for a while. and as always some of the prices will stick. though certainly not all.

and i still don't think the government supports are a major driver of this. the kinda of supports they gave would have had short term inflationary results which combatted the big deflationary pressures of our shut down policies here. 

the forced savings and shift in monthly commute costs to homes by high earners coupled with low interest rates lead to housing issues, but the people receiving government support weren't the ones driving that issue so i think we can hardly blame them. i mean people are now able to keep good jobs and live in cheaper parts of the country if they leave the gta as white collar professionals. that's a problem for affordability but it's not a government cause. 

what i think is going to be interesting to watch is just how much work from home remains a thing in 2022/23 and just how many people are going to be seeing increased costs to commuting for example and if they factored that into their \"im gonna take these savings and plop em into a further away bigger place to live\" plans.",liberals

immigration is a contributing factor to the increasing unaffordability of housing, but not the root cause. people seem to forget that immigrants also suffer from housing insecurity (even more so because they tend to have less capital to begin with), and many are looking outside of toronto and vancouver for cheaper options. in any case, slightly reducing immigration to fix housing is like taking a tylenol to fight cancer - it's choosing temporary relief over the actual solution. now, eliminating all immigration? yes that would certainly drive down demand significantly...because we would start to see a population decline in canada, and with an aging population that's no good.

yes, but \"traditional quebecois culture\" has not been dominant in québec since the quiet revolution.  the modern culture is fanatically secularist and has a strong resentment of all things associated with anglo culture when they are in québec (like, for example, the conservative party). 

modern culture here is conservative in the sense that it wants to conserve something.  i am just not convinced that the things people want to conserve in québec are worth conserving.  and at the provincial level, the contents of what you want to conserve are the most relevant thing. 
 
and at the federal level, if i am nationalist, why would i vote for the conservative party when i can vote for the bloc?  are you seriously going to try to convince me that a party that wins 10 seats in québec (on a good day) out of its ~120 seats will look after québec's interests better than the bloc, who have no interests outside of the province?  

the reason the conservative party is not successful with many nationalists is because whatever they can promise, the bloc can promise more.  most people who vote conservative in québec right now do not vote that way out of nationalism.  they're mostly older, middle-class people who want lower taxes and better job opportunities.

most of canadian history has been majority governments where the governing party couldn't give less of a crop what the minority parties think lmao. in america, due to the existence of a democratically legitimate senate (bicameral legislature) and separation of executive and legislative branches, you often get at least one party in control of senate, house or presidency. furthermore, due to fillibsutering in the senate, you almost always need the other parties approval to a degree. 

i also didn't mention how each us party is much more ideologically diverse and exerts much less control over mps. canada is known to be one of strictest party systems in the western world as mps are totally whipped to tote the party line. party leaders will oust you in a second for slight public dissent. just look at jody wilson raybald or derek sloan.

also let's not forget layton was successful in achieving consistent growth for the party with moderate seat gains and popular vote increases before 2011. he took the party from nothing when it was floundering and built it back up. 

you argue that singh has a better record because he got 15% of the vote in 2019 which is what layton achieved during his first election in 2004. what you don't factor in is layton took his party from 8% of the vote to *15%. that's a huge increase, while singh in 2019 lost half of their seats and their popular vote share went down as well. 

in 2021, singh failed to materialize all the trudeau disillusionment and only gained a single seat with marginal increases in the popular vote. layton at least built a broad coalition and he barely had any seats in quebec anyway so even excluding 2011 he was better at building a electoral base.

hp1vq54,2021-12-17T22:44:51.000-08:00,"justin trudeau shares father’s dislike of clause allowing override of charter rights &gt;not only as a compromise to the provinces but as a good check against the judiciary.

so i was reading an article somewhere that echoed this sentiment somewhat. they used the us as an example of how the judiciary might fail if it were to become increasingly partisan as per scotus. 

however, is there any evidence of this partisan pull on our supreme court?

if not, i'm curious as to the nature of your worries about the judiciary, and if they could perhaps be addressed in another way? if i remember correctly, scotus is really problematic as it is an appointment for life, where as we have a mandatory retirement age of 75 (although maybe there is a valid argument for that to be reduced too?).",liberals
