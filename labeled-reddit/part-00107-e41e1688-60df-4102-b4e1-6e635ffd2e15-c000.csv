one mentions a hurricane increasing sugar costs…. so that’s at least… weather.  one mentions droughts which certainly dropped wheat yields by 2-5%.

i am 100% for gun control, but only when it makes sense. this ban targets only licensed gun owners who already go thru a daily background check. it does nothing at targeting criminals or the fact that the only gun problem we have is with the ones illegally smuggled across the us border.

canada already has very strict gun laws that owners need to memorize and follow. adding more laws for already law abiding citizens to follow in no way shape or form will keep the guns out of the hands of criminals.

hl1qg5y,2021-11-17T06:48:12.000-08:00,"doug ford says he won’t sign a ‘bad deal’ with ottawa on $10-a-day daycare ontario would get funding for that age group. the fed amount is based on the number of children aged 0 to 12 in the province, relative to the number in canada.

the federal budget allocates $27.2 billion over five years to the provinces and territories, starting in the current fiscal year. ontario has 37.8 per cent of canada's population of children up to age 12, making its share of the five-year package worth $10.28 billion.

the problem that ford is claiming is that the feds require provinces to match the spending dollar for dollar. so ontario can get up to $10.28 b but if ontario wanted to only spend, let's say for example, $5 b, then the feds would only transfer $5 b.

ontario's current annual budget for child care is $2.28 b. but that figure does not include the province's $3.6 b in annual spending on full-day kindergarten for four and five year-olds, something that most other provinces do not provide. so ford basically wants the feds to cover half of the kindergarten costs out of that $10.28 b.

but at the same time, ford is also claiming that the total amount of funding won't be enough to get to $10/day, so you'd think that would mean he'd want to use the money for childcare, and not as a way to save half the kindergarten cost to spend on something else entirely.

but either way, he should have actually presented a counter proposal to the feds. he hasn't said what he thinks a fair deal would be. because it's very possible if he asked for these things the feds would agree, but ford doesn't actually want a deal right now, he wants one closer to the election.

kenney did the same thing. refused to negotiate for months. then when he finally did, a deal was quickly reached. trudeau showed he was willing to be flexible. but ford has to come to the table.",liberals

i was extremely against bill 21 for the longest time, but then it started making sense that since we have separation of state and church, we shouldn't have civil servants wear religious symbols, nor should they try to push religious ideals on anyone. this bill does *not* affect anyone outside of government work.

edit: those who are for this, what do you think of the argument of separating church from state? can we just bring back christian symbolism in all our schools? i think maybe the reddit crowd might be too young to remember what it was like 30-40 years ago where christianity was basically pushed down your throat, and if you didn't wear a cross, you'd be chastised.",liberals

&gt; we've also given millions in aid to gaza over the last decade, and just a few weeks ago added another $25m in humanitarian assistance, despite that for much of that time palestine has been governed by a terrorist group.

no it hasnt? hamas doesnt govern all of palestine for one and i'd like you to reframe or evaluate this in a different way. the actions of israel are state sanctioned terror, them being a recognized state doesnt lessen this in anyway, if hamas is governing but a terrorist organization, than israel is too. perhaps we should be more critical of israel bombing the infrastructure we're sending our money over there to help with then.... 

&gt; the vital ally is the us, and the region has been of great tactical and geopolitical importance for them whether or not we like their reasons,  which means we have to consider our relationship with them when acting in the region as well as the fact that, if they want our efforts to fail, they will fail.

i think it's an empty threat tariffs over this, but they do have other ways of coercing canada behind the scenes and it doesn't even matter because i think trudeau is likely fully bought in/convinced himself on the ideology of it all anyway so they have no need to threaten him because he's going to follow willingly.

gysb8vi,2021-05-19T14:32:54.000-07:00,"erin o'toole says conservatives' rejection of climate change resolution was 'a distraction' &gt; ok, so point the first: nowhere in that deranged rant did you provide any line of reasoning to support the idea that canada can have anything but a token effect on global climate change. that was my original point and nobody has been able to counter that. even you as much as admit that when you lump us together together with the other 2-percenters in the world.

yes, i did. reread the part about the 2-percenters - if all of those countries followed your \"plan\" (do nothing), we'd be screwed. ergo, it's a dumb plan - even small emitting countries need to do something to combat their pollution. we can also invest in carbon sinks, such as tree planting, or export green tech. finally, the best thing the global community can do is set a price on carbon - carbon taxes work, at least according to most economists.

again, conservatives abandon their principles the moment climate is mentioned - you are all for listening to economic experts until carbon taxes are brought up, in which case you plug your ears and pretend you can't see the evidence.

&gt; point the second: you did do a fantastic job of projecting your own biases and preconceived notions on me. way to go chief. that says a lot more about you than me

please, it's painfully obvious you're a conservative - don't see a lot of climate action denial coming out of any other party. everything i said is true - you shrink at the thought of taking personal responsibility for your pollution, because that might cost you money.

&gt; you see, this isn't a moral issue. it's about working towards a measurable, specific goal. one that involves math and numbers.

first off, yes it is absolutely a moral issue - polluting the planet and leaving it worse for your children is a bad thing to do. i get you subscribe to the conservative ethos of 'fuck you, got mine', but most people do genuinely care about how we tackle climate change for the sake of the future generations.

second, yes the numbers absolutely point towards needing to take immediate action on climate change. there's a reason every single party is now advocating for a price on carbon - any party without a climate plan is not ready to govern. the only people who think differently are very conservative (and sorry to break it to you, but nobody takes their opinions seriously - not even the cpc).

&gt; they're not free. the costs of those measures will be borne by those on the bottom. 

first off that's simply not true - the carbon footprint of the rich is far, far, far greater than that of the poor. second, that's why the rebate exists - if you pollute less than the average canadian, you make money. if you pollute more, you lose money. if you don't want to lose money, you can change your lifestyle to consume less carbon, and start making money on the rebate.

you're right that the only thing that works is money, and so the solution is obvious - put a price on carbon. nothing else will make society switch gears in the time we need it to.

&gt; you preach to me about 'morality' while you and your pampered golden boy are more than willing to sacrifice the livelihoods of those on the bottom so you can get a warm fuzzy for 'doing something'.

oh please, don't be so dramatic. whoever wins the next election, you're getting a carbon tax. the debate is settled.

look at the conservative track record:

gay marriage, they were against it, and they were wrong.

abortion, they were against it, and they were wrong.

legal weed, they were against it, and they were wrong.

climate change, they denied it, and they were wrong.

why would anyone support a political philosophy that is just so consistently wrong?

well, we both know the answer to that - not many people nowadays. we both know who's going to win the next election, and it's not o'toole.",conservatives

the lands were taken in an underhanded way.  aboriginal people should be compensated for that.  and the historic treatment of aboriginal people was cultural genocide, and canada needs to pay for that.  and there are continual ongoing systemic racism issues that impact aboriginal peoples to an insane degree that every canadian should want to fix. 


that doesn't mean that undrip is good legislation. 



eg: 

article 19: aboriginal peoples must provide their full and informed consent before any laws or administrative changes can be applied to their people.  (currently laws just need to be passed by the appropriate legislative body).  what happens if/when aboriginal people decide not to consent to updates to various criminal laws?  


article 26: \"1. indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have tradi-tionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.\"
guaranteed land rights well beyond treaties or historic agreement. 

\"2. indigenous peoples have the right to own, use, develop  and  control  the  lands,  territories  and  resources  that  they  possess  by  reason  of  tra-ditional  ownership  or  other  traditional  occu-pation or use, as well as those which they have otherwise acquired.\"
indigenous rights over historically occupied territory.  


article 27:
\"states shall establish and implement, in conjunc-tion  with  indigenous  peoples  concerned,  a  fair,  independent,  impartial,  open  and  transparent  process,  giving  due  recognition  to  indigenous  peoples’ laws, traditions, customs and land tenure systems,  to  recognize  and  adjudicate  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples  pertaining  to  their  lands,  territories  and  resources\"


remember previous articles.  this effectively requires aboriginal peoples and processes a say on the activities of all of canada, as it is all traditionally occupied land.  


article 28: 
any treaty which was written unfairly (all of them) need to be fixed and the aboriginal peoples compensated.  (how much is down town toronto worth?)
\"2.  unless  otherwise  freely  agreed  upon  by  the  peoples  concerned,  compensation  shall  take  
21the form of lands, territories and resources equal in  quality,  size  and  legal  status  or  of  monetary  compensation or other appropriate redress\"


article 29:
\"states  shall  take  effective  measures  to  ensure  that  no  storage  or  disposal  of  hazardous  ma-terials shall take place in the lands or territories of indigenous peoples without their free, prior and informed consent.\"


this makes sense, but then you remember the previous articles,  by definition all of canada is aboriginal lands.  this grants an effective veto over any development involving hazardous materials (ie: all industry).  


i can go on, but many of the issues are relating to including historic lands, and effective veto's over the use of historic lands.  

and as mentioned at the beginning, there are many problems and many injustices that need to be fixed.

that doesn't mean we can fix it by granting a group of people effective veto power over everyone else.",liberals

h353h4c,2021-06-26T06:22:02.000-07:00,"pierre trudeau's failures on indigenous rights tarnish his legacy [joseph heath](https://www.academia.edu/43470485/two_dilemmas_for_u_s_race_relations) describes canada as having two models for cultural pluralism - basically, the quebec model (separate institutions) and the multiculturalism model (integration without requiring assimilation), often credited to pierre trudeau. both work reasonably well.

the quebec model works because the francophone minority is large and geographically concentrated. for indigenous peoples, it seems workable for larger first nations, but less so for smaller and more remote ones.

the 1969 white paper proposed the multicultural model for indigenous peoples, and was rejected.

&gt; ... it is possible to address a great number of issues on reserves through a strategy of “indigenous self-government,” which is to say, turning reserves into an order of government, with their own jurisdiction and powers [like the quebec model]. unfortunately, reserves vary enormously in size and geography, which dramatically affects their capacity to provide an institutionally complete society for their members. this in turn makes a uniform devolution of powers impossible. “self-government” means one thing on the kahnawake mohawk reserve, which has a population of over 8,000 and is situated next door to a major metropolitan centre. this reserve has both the means and the capacity to run a primary school system that functions entirely in mohawk. compare that to the red pheasant reserve, population 600, in rural saskatchewan. even if there were the capacity to deliver primary-language cree education, there is practically no economic opportunity on reserve, nor any obvious way of creating it. a self-governing minority nation in this case would refrain from providing members with the skills required for successful integration into the majority culture, but fail to provide a viable alternative set of institutions, that would allow for a comparable level of economic opportunity, political influence and social satisfaction. thus the multinational model [the quebec model] of cultural pluralism in this case becomes a recipe for marginalization. it allows members of the group to opt out of majority institutions, which on the one hand relieves them of the burden of having to integrate into a culturally alien set of practices, but on the other hand, denies them access to the not-inconsiderable benefits of these mainstream institutions (in particular, white-collar work in the modern economy). if the institutions of the minority nation are unable to compensate for the loss of those mainstream benefits, the result will be the emergence of significant inequality between members of the minority and majority groups.
&gt; 
&gt; ... conflict of this form [rejection of multiculturalism] arose in dramatic fashion in 1969, when the government of canada issued a “white paper” on indian affairs, proposing to abolish the indian act, phase out the reserve system (on the grounds that the policy of “separation” and “different status” “has led to a blind alley of deprivation and frustration”), and to integrate indians into canadian society as “equal” members. this proposal was emphatically rejected by indigenous leaders, not just as bad policy, but as a “betrayal.” the entire episode is now looked back upon as a dark period in crown-indigenous relations, and the white paper is routinely condemned as a template for “cultural genocide.”
&gt;
&gt; the mistake lay in **the federal government having laid out a road map for integration [multiculturalism] with a population group that instead favoured, and was entitled to demand, self-government [the quebec model]**. since that time indigenous policy in canada has remained very much stuck in a bind. many reserves are not economically self-sufficient and have no credible prospect of providing an institutionally complete social environment. yet neither are they able to equip their members with the capabilities required to achieve success in mainstream canadian institutions (the education system, the labour-market, etc.). the government cannot make up for the latter set of deficits too assertively, or pursue the standard set of [multiculturalism] policies to integrate first nations peoples, because that might be seen as encouraging members to live off reserve (and thus as promoting cultural genocide). the results are huge inequalities of opportunity (typically characterized in terms of the “third world” living conditions that prevail on many reserves) which the government then attempts to blunt by intervening in the administration of reserves in ways that are an affront to their sovereignty. the result is a classic stuck file, with self-government, integration and equality standing in relations of mutual antagonism.",liberals

in other words, the timing of the election call from the bcndp was opportunistic, yes, but worse still—the majority mandate they got as a result meant unchecked power for the rest of the pandemic, and that has turned out to be a disaster.

the sow establishes the principle that the parliament of canada is equal to, rather than subordinate to, the parliament of the united kingdom. a corollory of this is that the gg follows the advice of the *canadian* pm, rather than taking instructions from london.

moreover, you misunderstand the nature of precedent in our constitution. precedent is strictly binding in like-for-like cases, but wherever there are material differences, precedent is only indicative.

during the prorogation crisis, the government had, in fact, passed a throne speech through the house, and the gg felt empowered to insist that the prorogation be for a definite six-week period. finally, there was no request for a dissolution in 2008, and it is at least ambiguous whether the gg would have granted such a request.",liberals

as well, from my reading of the article, there were two points to it that are equally important. the first was whether debt was good or not, which their answer seemed to be its not as bad as the people on the right claim. i am no expert in how debt will affect the economy as a whole, and so don't want to try to wad into that muck.

the second argument from this article i believe is more relevant. it's that conservatives don't really care about the debt. this is evident from the fact that when they do cut spending, they usually cut taxes as well (which does nothing to help alleviate the debt situation). from what little economics i know, this will create a less tenable economic situation as it will concentrate wealth and reduce the amount the average person has to spend (this is due to cutting of government jobs which tend to have higher wages and more benefits than comparable private sector work). this in turn leads to less spending overall which freezes the economy as a whole.

i do think a conservative politician would be hurt more by a blackface scandal, because people tend to associate conservatism with racism. scandals stick when they confirm a view that voters already have about politicians. for example, the email scandal really stuck to hillary because many people already viewed her as untrustworthy and shady. the \"just visiting\" stuff stuck to ignatieff because he came off as aristocratic and out of touch. but blackface didn't stick to trudeau, in large part because i don't think most canadian voters see trudeau as racist, so it was easier to write it off as a stupid mistake.

a view that many canadians do have of trudeau is that he's a little image-obsessed and airheaded. look no further than the india scandal, which had a much greater impact on polls than blackface. there's also a general image of the liberal party cutting backroom deals with big corporations, so snc stuck to him.",liberals

once the crisis passes, who knows if that persists. like, they're going to have to restrict spending at some point in the next year, and people are going to feel it. or maybe the recovery doesn't go as well as expected. there are huge question marks looking past 2021.

there are some really tough questions to be asked about the federal government's handling of the border during the pandemic. why did phac not produce forward looking projections in february 2020? why didn't we target countries with high levels of vocs in 2021? looking at the maritimes, it's obvious that strong border policies are effective at keeping case numbers down. it's estimated that vocs make up over 70% of new cases in ontario right now¹, there's no doubt that better border controls could have mitigated this. yes, the ford goverment did a bad job, but so did the federal government did too.

there have been tons of politicians in the past with similar attributes - obama, clinton, jfk who were generally liked by both men and women. plus remember back in 2015, trudeau received massive support from both genders to form a majority government.

this is my theory. trudeau presided of the largest increase in wealth inequality. it has become significantly harder now for someone from a lower income family to rise to middle-class or to purchase a home without the support of their parents. due to societal pressures, men may feel more impacted by this. they are less likely to be able to settle down if they are not financially capable which can lead to the feeling of helplessness. remember that during the great recession, male suicide rates rose significantly worldwide because many men felt helpless. i have seen similar attitudes in some men today.

helplessness breeds resentment and it is easy to resent someone like trudeau who is one of the most privileged persons alive in canada. his father was a former pm, he comes from extremely wealthy background, he probably owns multiple properties and has benefited significantly from the housing crisis and trudeau is also estimated to be worth $10 million. it is easy to resent trudeau who had many things handed to him all throughout his life and became pm partly due to nepotism when you life has become harder while he was pm.",liberals

and those functional countries don't have permanent minorities - they create coalition governments that indeed are the things that you are facetiously dismissing. for example, the reason minority governments fall is usually because either the government or opposition force an opportunistic election, because they're slightly up in the polls and that could mean a huge change in the number of seats they could win. in a proportional system though, being up 5 percent or whatever would only mean being up on 5 percent of seats. and without the opportunity to win a majority government, the incentive to force early elections is essentially removed.",liberals

i don't care about silly rankings from silly theoreticists with zero practical experience. coalition governments are directly dependent on # of parties, not what system you use. this is why both india and germany - nations that have well over 15 parties that contest national elections every cycle, have had 1 or 2 majority govt in the last 40 years and usually operate via coalition format. 

you want coalitions- make more parties and make it easier for parties to get on the ballot. 

but lets not make a system that magnifies the nazis and the commies and gives them a greater voice. period. 

you seem to think that democracy is some fundamental pillar that we must accept, even if it means electing hitler. sorry but no. the entire point we have democracy is because it gives us less hitlers than autocracies do. and if democracies start throwing up more potential hitlers, then i prefer to go back to autocracy. and unlike most here, i have lived in an autocratic society as a foreigner, so i am not just speaking outta my butt as these so called western theoreticists. 

&amp;#x200b;

ps: the most advanced democracy in the world today is india. with the greatest political diversity and a more advanced form of tiered democracy, where regional parties are far more relevant for state elections ( as they should be) and inter-regional parties far more relevant in national elections. as it should be. 

a more advanced canadian political system would see parties that are focussed on bc, ontario, alberta, etc. winning their provincial elections but only being outsider support to the national level parties such as cpc, ndp, liberals, etc. ie, more bq. because love em or hate em, they emphatically demonstrate that a state/province is better off if they have a local party in power, giving them more leverage to negotiate with the center. 

well, this is the political geography of the world's largest and most advanced democracy for the last 40-50 years and counting.",liberals

hcldqn4,2021-09-12T04:34:38.000-07:00,"time to ditch first-past-the-post electoral system i agree.

i think the strategies of the parties would change.  the liberals have positioned themselves as the \"centrist\" party, and likely would be in any pr coalition, but there is nothing stopping the ndp moving more to the centre, or the cpc eschewing the old reform and hewing closer to the old pcs and recapturing the right half of centre.  the liberals would face pressure on both fronts.

a successful party under pr would look different than a successful party under fptp.  the necessity of the reform/pc merger fades under pr.  i *think* the ppc would recapture the old reformists, and the cpc would try to recapture the old red tories from the liberals.  so, potential \"downside\" could be that the ppc is much more successful.  realistically, under this scenario i'm assuming the ppc under pr would change and would be different than ppc under fptp.  also, the \"problem\"^1 isn't that the ppc is a party, it's how many electors support them.

it's really tough to say how things would change with pr.  people would tend to vote for their favourite, rather than the less bad candidate, and the whole dynamic changes between political parties.  instead of maintaining some form of doctrinal purity and hold out for the next shot at a majority government, minority governments become much more normal, and compromise between coalition partners becomes more normal as well.  one big change would be the \"special interest\" parties, as now you can have more narrowly focused parties whose strategy is to join a coalition with the larger parties and push for their specific issue.

it also depends greatly on the form of pr.  my personal favourite is stv, which is technically only pr-ish.  but in that case there would be some more smaller special interest parties, but probably not too much different than today.  my second favourite would be a new zealand style mmp.  there again there would be more room for smaller parties.  in the [last nz election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_new_zealand_general_election), only 5 parties actually got seats, with 98 out of 120 going to the big 2 parties, labour and national.  applied to canada, i would expect not much change, other than a few less cpc and lpc seats, a few more ndp and green seats, and no idea about the bq.

1.in 2015 the lpc won 80 seats in ontario with a 10% lead compared to 79 seats with a lead of 8.5%. when you talk about lpc ‘vote efficiency’ ontario is really the place. in 2019 he won almost all of the close races (minus the one mentioned above) and managed to lose only one seat despite leading by 1.5% less than 2015. it was almost a surgical result winning by the smallest of margins in so many seats. 

that being said, other than the one seats mentioned above, most of the other seats weren’t as close. it’s going to be disproportionally more difficult to win additional seats in the region because he’s going to have to start winning the safer seats than just the tossups. 

2. i’m waiting to see if the most recent friday bump is the start of a new trend. i do t have access to the regionals, but the numbers didn’t move much today which means that the new sample was pretty close to the sample that was dropped (at least in terms of top line numbers) so it’s possible that by tuesday that this friday sample is dropped and it was a blip. campaign research just released an ontario specific poll with sample size bigger than the three daily trackers ontario regionals combined which showed the gap to be 4%, so this change would have to be brand new. also, the ekos ontario number didn’t actually move, the change in top line was from atlantic canada. 

if trudeau were to get a majority, i think ironically it would be gains in alberta (edmonton) and potentially the prairies along with quebec. i don’t see that coming from ontario as i don’t see him greatly beating his 2015 numbers to make significant gains there.",liberals

as has been said, the strategies change under various forms of pr and av.  the cpc has moved to the right, as a result of the reform merger, purely as a response to fptp.  under pr, the old reform/pc marriage is unnecessary.  i would expect some movement to the centre from the cpc, embracing the old pc heritage.  if the loose the old hardline reformers but pick up the old red tories, they are still set to rebuild a coalition, without worrying about splitting the vote.

likewise, the ndp is also squeezing the liberals on the left as it were.

i think you are essentially correct, the liberals *would* be successful under pr or av, they've positioned themselves as the true centrist party, but even that positioning only happened in the last 15 or so years, and all the other parties know the field just as well.  so that success isn't guaranteed forever.  the absence of the spoiler effect makes it simple for even a new centrist party to emerge.",liberals

my personal opinion is that policy needs to change the psychological relationship canadians have with real estate to move away from viewing it non-primary residences as \"investments\". storing wealth in one's house is not the issue; parking all of one's money into real estate because renting and flipping are guaranteed revenue streams is the problem. this has resulted in demand increasing, which is worsened by an industry that is designed to thrive on a fear of missing out. the underlying elements have created a perfect storm, compounded by monetary policy and increased savings from the pandemic. 

for the record, i think the government's solution of throwing chump change at affordable housing and targeting foreign buyers is pathetic, and a slap in the face to a generation of canadians. but, simply focusing on increasing supply is also ignorant, either intentionally or unintentionally.",liberals

that’s why these polls mean little, is if you are asking basic yes/no questions without context, of course people choose the one that feels better, and has little bearing on if they truly support the policies as the vast majority likely don’t understand the impact to themselves, whether financially or environmentally.

the procurement shitshow must go on.

&gt;the three aerospace firms bidding on the fighter jet program were told in writing by the federal government that a decision would be made this month on a “down select” of companies that would be allowed to advance to the final stage of the competition. that, in turn, would set the stage for the winning bidder to be announced in march/april of 2022.

[canada on track to pick new fighter jet next year despite covid-19](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-on-track-to-pick-new-fighter-jet-next-year-despite-covid-19-1.5370950) 

*april 1st, 2021*

i mean c'mon, just a little bit funny?

&gt;the conservative government had selected the f-35 stealth fighter as the air force’s new jet, but backed away from that plan after concerns about the technology and growing costs.

&gt;during the 2015 election campaign, **liberal leader justin trudeau vowed that his government would not purchase the f-35.**

&gt;**but the liberal government backed away from that promise to freeze out the f-35 and the aircraft is now seen as a top contender in the competition** as it has many supporters in the rcaf. the three aircraft being considered are lockheed martin’s f-35, boeing’s super hornet and saab’s gripen.

i don't hide that i'm rooting for the f-35. super hornets would be okay, but i don't think we need to snuggle up close to sweden? buying a cheaper and inferior plane because we want... cheaper meatballs? idgi

at the end of the documentary, both guys met up with each other to talk about what they learned and literally the first sentence from each of them was blaming toronto.

i think they both managed to practice a politics of place, that activated locally important symbols (it's probably not a coincidence that both came out of local politics). and the political map they generated looked different too from their federal counterparts. klein tended not to do great in (r)edmonton, at least compared to other alberta pcs (stelmach, redford) or reform/alliance/cpc. 

i don't know if it translates nationally. the cpc tries to do these \"man of the people\" image-crafting (harper's imagery was inspired by jaime watt of the ontario pcs, who in turn was drawing from john howard), but it tends to be very unconvincing. at times harper would evoke these themes and blunder when things were read differently in other regions. at one point in 2008, harper was ahead in québec. then he cut arts funding and said \" \"ordinary working people were unable to relate to taxpayer-subsidized cultural elites when they see them at a rich gala on television\". it backfired massively in québec, where the same narrative about the role of arts in society just doesn't fly.",conservatives
