what the 905 is, is a belt full of middle-class homeowners. a certain percentage of the people here will always vote conservative because their main issue is keeping taxes low. the more left-leaning people in the 905 tend to care about things like education and healthcare, but many of them are skeptical of new spending programs, and since they've already \"made it\", they too fear higher taxes. the ndp, fairly or unfairly, has a more radical reputation that these kinds of voters just can't vote for. and among the 905ers who would be willing to vote ndp, it just seems like a poor choice strategically, because like i said, the tories have a pretty high basement of support in this region. voters are more or less aware that the ndp is a non-entity in most parts of the 905, so they strategically vote liberal.

horwath was unlucky in a sense. in 2018, the people who had always strategically voted for the liberals either had enough with wynne, or they saw the ndp up in the polls and voted strategically for the ndp. at the same time, many 'blue' liberals voted pc because they had enough with wynne, or they voted pc strategically to keep out the ndp. yet others remained loyal to their traditional party/incumbent liberal mpp--look at [ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ajax_(provincial_electoral_district)), where this exact pattern led to a pc win. in neighbouring [whitby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whitby_(provincial_electoral_district)), there was far less of a split, the liberals collapsed and gave the ndp a boost--but the high floor of pc support meant, as long as there was a liberal candidate in the race, the ndp didn't have a hope.",liberals

[for example](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-15/trudeau-s-rift-with-finance-chief-weighs-on-virus-recovery-plan): 

&gt;after spending hundreds of billions to prevent a major depression, justin trudeau will make critical decisions in coming weeks on the next steps to support canada’s economic recovery. that will include whether to keep or drop the only finance minister he has ever had.

&gt;the strains between trudeau and bill morneau, the two most powerful men in the government, burst into public view last week. bloomberg news reported aug. 10 that the prime minister has been taking advice on an economic recovery plan from mark carney, the ambitious former bank of canada and bank of england governor. the following afternoon, trudeau was forced to issue an extraordinary statement expressing “full confidence” in morneau, to quiet the drumbeat of speculation about the minister’s future.

&gt;a face-to-face meeting between the two men is scheduled for monday, according to a person familiar with their calendars who spoke on condition of anonymity.

&gt;an ethics scandal that has engrossed trudeau’s government and implicates both men is hurting the relationship. but more consequential are differences of opinion on how c$240 billion ($181 billion) in emergency pandemic spending has been rolled out and how much more the state should spend to support the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic.

&gt;for this account of how the relationship frayed, bloomberg spoke to more than half a dozen people either directly involved with policy deliberations or with knowledge of how decisions were made.

&gt;multiple officials in morneau’s finance department described how they were overruled in key debates -- how their concerns about cost or lack of analysis were ignored and how they wound up on the losing end of many policy arguments.",liberals

me neither, thankfully that's not what's written.

what is written is that accountability mechanisms aren't functional to efficacy.

&gt; they're not decoupled at all and shouldn't be for very good reason.  

they are decoupled, they're different laws. for example, the accountability law does not change the carbon price. the accountability law can produce information to adjust the carbon price as a policy decision, but it does not adjust the carbon price functionally.

&gt;  in fact, even speaking of them as if they were decoupled is confusing because it's just...obviously not how any of this works?

ensuring that there is a robust, independent process in place is very important. the liberals won't hold power forever, and the stronger the accountability mechanism, the better. if the first accountability measures are not in place until 2030, it's very likely that a future government will scrap them rather than face them, especially if it looks like we won't hit the targets.",liberals

your example with the colour red isn't that far fetched. for instance, since conservatives use a certain shade of blue, and conservatives are often conflated with the extreme right by radical leftists; all it would take to see a \"blue ban\" is for those radicals to gain power. how so?

well, similar minds think alike right? and those similar minds have tried to link conservative views to all sorts of radical and wacky theories with little to no merit. they also have done the same with differing views among the left, but of course with a skew in bias. hence a main reason why you have to be hyper vigilant against those 'political tests' and such online. if one takes them, it's usually best to take them with a lump of salt, as they often come with an innate bias attached already. one you can tell if you know what to look for, for both sides.

so, all it takes for the colour blue to become banned, is for those very same people i allude to gaining power and majority consensus among the voting populous to boot; whilst also somehow creating a narrative that that particular shade of blue somehow triggers extremist thinking.

i don't believe in tearing people down for the sake of equality. but i think it's important to be mindful of typical conditions to understand political trends etc. for instance, finding that stagnant wage stat made anger at teachers' pay make a lot more sense to me when it hadn't before. i now tell people \"what if teachers' pay is what we should all be making if incomes had kept up and you're underpaid as opposed to them being overpaid\".

my other frustration is this stagnant wage fact is just not a topic on the zeitgeist. it's actually a pretty uniquely american and canadian phenomenon. because all our media comes from the us where it has also occurred we think it's happened everywhere. but it hasn't happened in japan or europe, their incomes are well above the 1970s' level. why the us and canada have done so poorly, as far as i can tell nobody knows. 

so if i'm being honest i think there could be something to the doctors' strategy of very carefully limiting supply. that was actually my prior point earlier. one of the other ways quality of life has gone down is you need more and more education to make that same flat median wage. if more professions had as much control over their numbers' perhaps there wouldn't have been this stagnation? actually push people in the trades instead of low-quality undergrads?

2. when an accident happens and cause damage to the car and the building who is to cover it? icbc?the building insurance? or the resident own insurance? how will we investigate is it the car battery that cause the issue, the building power supply issue, the user error? coz is unfair if it only falls on the building insurance over say the battery issue in the car (is a battery there is always going to chance of issue) or the owner didn't plug the charger right and cause issue. building insurance already went up 75% last year and why should the rest of us chip in when it is not the building fault? 
3. what about seniors or others that have no internet access? how will they register to use the charger? 

none of them were answer and was just given a we will deal with it later. just can't wait to see owner unplugging others car so they can get a charge and started fighting or the buildings insurance went to a few hundred thousand dollars coz someone car battery explodes and cause the sprinkler to go off.",liberals

this is the concept the young people never understand, each and every one of those things lost him voters because sadly everything you do as a politician loses you support. no matter how good a policy is, there are always some people who lose out and you'll lose their support. people like my dad who thinks universal day care is bullshit ( even though i heard him talk glowingly about it when it was just a thing in europe ), thinks he botched marijuana legalization ( even though he swore they'd never legalize growing your own because it'd be all about the tax ), and hates trudeau for giving covid benefits to the unemployed ( it's a fucking pandemic ).

the sad part is that we on the left could change it by voting for people on the left, even if we don't fully agree with them. that is how you give them more political capital. i personally think trudeau is far more progressive then he lets on, but he has to play the game and spend his capital wisely, lest he lose the moderates such as my father ( lost cause there).

&gt;alas, that would require much higher rates of private investment than we currently enjoy, which means taxing the returns to that investment less punitively. the other ingredient of higher productivity: more competition – for example, by more fully opening industries such as airlines, financial services, and telecommunications to foreign players.

we spent the last 30 years lowering rates on investment - lower corporate tax, lower capital gains, faster depreciation schemes, about a thousand boutique tax breaks, expanding sheltered savings accounts...shall we go on. did it work? no, but apparently that's irrelevant for coyne. i don't know where he is getting this idea, but this sure not from reality.

the competition plank is also on surprisingly weak ground, there is scarce evidence that competition is a critical element for economic growth. indeed, famously corporatist asia engages in heavy industrial policy and often has weak competition - it's hardly harmed their growth. europe, by contrast, actually has [fairly robust competition](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/europe-not-america-home-free-market/600859/) compared to north america these days, but when it comes to economic growth, it's a basket-case. competition is worthwhile on it's merits, but it's not a surefire driver of growth.

conservatives like coyne have been telling this economic story since the 80s, but the inconvenient fact is that it just hasn't come true. we haven't recieved the benefits of widely shared prosperity, we haven't even boosted growth. i don't think people are buying it anymore.",conservatives

&gt; if i'm trying to figure out how that happened the very first thing i would do would be to get my hands on a copy of the document the journalist was given and compare it to my own. 

which is what they did. 

if you read the article, it says they requested to know what documents were given out, which is absolutely perfectly okay. easy peasy, they'd be able to figure out where these numbers came from by looking at what documents were given out. if global can request the relevant documents, the minister sure as shit can do the same thing.

where they broke the law is when they started trying to find out who was getting what documents.

these rules exist for a very good reason and are in place to prevent retaliation against journalists and other canadians by the state when canadians request information to hold the government accountable.

and before anyone says \"knowing who's getting the info hardly makes a difference\" look at the case of sean bruyea.

he spoke out against the government's lies regarding veteran's pensions, and was then defamed by the minister in the media and had his child's benefits improperly cancelled the very next day. funny how that happens, eh?

that is what the government will do when they know who's being a thorn in their side. they'll go after you and your children, and that is why these rules are so important.

the government can't retaliate against citizens and media holding them accountable, if they don't know who's getting what info.

gye4qep,2021-05-16T11:28:29.000-07:00,"trudeau and biden continue support for israeli apartheid despite public pressure my biggest gripe with articles like this is the mischaracterizations or flat-out misrepresentation of actions and events that they feed to their readers. 

reading this, you'd think canada came out and blamed palestine:

&gt;during the early stages of israel’s latest assault, both the trudeau and biden administrations stuck to the narrative that renewed hostilities were predominately the fault of palestinians, even if they rhetorically nodded to the need for ‘both sides’ to do better. 

to suggest canada just blamed palestine for the violence is just not true. these pieces are a game of cherry-picking events and statements to push their point, accurate representation of events be damned.

canada has ***not*** blamed palestine for the violence. rather, officials have made several references both to the violence in al-aqsa and israeli expansion of settlements, demolitions, and evictions.

despite this, the paragraph continues: 

&gt;on may 14, foreign affairs minister marc garneau focused his speech in parliament on the “indiscriminate barrage of rockets from hamas,” and israel’s “right, and in fact duty, to defend itself,” when we all know the only group that can stop this conflict is israel itself.

well, on **may 12**, minister marc garneau released a statement that said:

&gt;“canada has been following the situation in israel, the west bank, and gaza with grave concern. we are appalled by the ongoing violence, rising tensions, and loss of life, including children. our thoughts are with the families of the victims and their loved ones.  
  
“canada urges all parties to take immediate steps to end the violence, de-escalate tensions, protect civilians, and uphold international law. **we stand firmly with the israeli and palestinian peoples in their right to live in peace, security, with dignity, without fear, and with their human rights respected.**  
  
“the indiscriminate barrage of rocket attacks fired by hamas into populated areas of israel is absolutely unacceptable and must cease immediately. canada supports israel's right to live in peace with its neighbours within secure boundaries and recognizes israel's right to assure its own security.  
&gt;  
&gt;“**canada is deeply disturbed by the completely unacceptable violence in jerusalem, including in and around al-aqsa. these events are especially upsetting during the holy month of ramadan.** places of worship are for people to gather for peaceful reflection and should never be sites of violence. it is crucial to respect the sanctity and safety of holy sites. violence in and around the haram al-sharif/temple mount must stop.  
  
“**canada remains gravely concerned by the continued expansion of settlements, and by the demolitions and evictions, including the ongoing cases in sheikh jarrah and silwan. these actions impact families and livelihoods and do not serve peace or international law.** unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of direct negotiations and further jeopardize the prospects for a two-state solution must be avoided.    
  
“canada is committed to the goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the middle east, including **the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with israel.** canada reiterates its call for the immediate de-escalation of tensions and an end to the violence.  
  
“with israeli and palestinian youth and future generations top of our mind, we urge all parties to renew their commitment to peace and security. we will always stand ready to support efforts for a two-state solution.”

it also completely ignores statements from the prime minister on the issue. on **may 13**, trudeau said this in response to the eruption of violence in the region:

&gt;violence in al-aqsa is also unacceptable. places of worship are for people to gather peacfully and should never be sights of violence. **we're also gravely concerned by the continuous expansion of settlements and and evictions.** canada supports a two-state solution, and we urge all parties to renew their commitment to peace and security.",liberals

i think this is a useful differentiator. to the extent that someone is a \"lone wolf\", terrorism never feels terribly appropriate (unless perhaps they get away and make a series of repeated attacks). it's the fear of continuing attacks that i think constitute terrorism and usually this is by a group of some sort. so if someone is trained by a group to commit a suicide attack - yes it is terrorism because there may be more from where he came from.",liberals

h125jp9,2021-06-08T04:37:26.000-07:00,"lilley: trudeau's hypocrisy another reason to scrap covid hotels i don't agree with the anti trudeau narrative of this article however it has some points worth raising in this subreddit. 

1 - it does make sense for the prime minister to have a specific hotel in ottawa to quarantine at, it doesn't make sense to give all of his staff and media the same. some of the staff i can understand, they may be needed at a moments notice to do their jobs as aids to the prime minister, they may be needed to help govern the country at a moments notice. media that travels with trudeau on the other hand should not be given special treatment whatsoever. hotel quarantine is part of their job as it is for many people travelling right now. 

2 - indeed in my opinion, hotel quarantines should be scrapped entirely and canadians should be once again allowed to quarantine for 10-14 days in their own homes. this worked before the variants showed up and we're at a point now with easing restrictions and low enough new cases where it makes little sense to uphold the hotel rule. although i think the governments are working on a global solution to allowing travel and scrapping the hotel quarantine immediately could increase non essential travel because i know first hand that there are people only not travelling right now because of the hotel quarantine. additionally, i'm unsure why trudeau had to invoke cabinet confidence and create such secrecy around why the hotel quarantines must be done. 

3 - why did patty hajdu say she would discuss scrapping the hotel measures with the provinces then not bring it up at all?",liberals

no, we found an unmarked graveyard of children who died from illness which is now evidence of a callous and horrific disregard for the children. and we knew this was a thing before.  and no, genocide doesn't fit. the schools were an attempt at assimilation, not genocide and the abuses were not gov't policy or even the policy of the church, they were the acts of individuals who grossly abused their power and they were also a result of a gov't who failed in it's job at oversight.

&gt; this isn't liberal history, it's canadian history.

in regard to this specific fact that we're talking about - it's liberal history. the liberal gov't received a report from a liberal gov't employee and it chose to ignore that report. so. what we're discussing is liberal history.  your side sure doesn't seem to have any qualms about erasing john a from the history books over this and noting he was conservative but holy smokes you sure are getting butthurt when someone brings up a popular liberal prime minister who did his share.

well if we're being fair for most of the time the churches were the ones who were in direct control and had direct responsibilities for the school. i'm not sure how you're going to extract them from the equation. and i might be a little more sympathetic except that the church is still being uncooperative today.  so while the whole residental school thing ended about 30 years ago and most people today could'nt even vote when it was a thing never mind when the abuses were bad or these kids died, the church is still at this moment participating in the crime actively. so i think you'd be hard pressed to suggest they're not a fair target.",liberals

i noticed that both this article and this [previous one](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-catholic-church-residential-school-records-1.6053565) had substantially scaled back the certainty level of the details. both say that there \"could\" or \"may\" be remains of children at the site, which is less assertive than both the original wave of reporting [and the original press release](https://tkemlups.ca/wp-content/uploads/05-may-27-2021-ttes-media-release.pdf) that was the source for the story. likewise no mention of \"mass graves\", a term that connotes something much different from what seems to be discovered.

hopefully if this technology proves to be  useful it can be used at other residential school sites. the article notes that you have to clear surface impediments but that shouldn't be a big obstacle. most schools were in remote areas and are not exactly hallowed ground. don't know how well it would function in muskeg though",liberals

there is a actually not much of jump for justin trudeau searches on the 1 day and 30 day graphs, but there is a larger jump on the 7 day graph. in terms of parties there was basically no jump at all. with bolton, interestingly its not even the highest search day in the last 30 days.

bolton peaked at 6-7pm and trudeau peaked at 6-7pm (pst), then the searches went down. that also happens to be the time most of the major news networks air their prime time nightly show. it is already on a steep decline, and i cant see it lasting longer than the freeland twitter thing or the \"brothers thing\", both fizzled out at the 3 day mark. 

if this keep happening on the campaign trail like this, it could affect votes, or it could go the other way. there have also been constant indigenous protests and a guy whose relative got killed by iran in the plan attack was yelling at trudeau. those are not good for trudeau and are much harder to claim victim hood with.

halifax has a lower commercial and residential property tax than cape breton does, but we only receive $15million as a transfer from the provincial government.  meanwhile the municipality pays out i think $25million to the province in service fees.  so yes, that's $10million we have to make up in taxes before we can even start as a municipality to pay for things like road repair or snow plowing or running the garbage trucks.  it's no wonder we have to have a higher tax rate than halifax.  

from the nova scotia equalization fairness group: **\"the  nova scotia government will receive $2.14 billion this year in  equalization payment. the cbrm should receive $247 million. we don’t.  get involved.\"**

oh and the provincial liberals and pcs both refuse to sit and talk with the equalization fairness group.  the pcs i believe have promised to double the payment to $30million and then \"talk about it later\" but they refuse to sit down with them now to even just talk about it or even answer them back.  the federal mps they have contacted keep either ignoring them entirely or saying that it's the provinces responsibility and then give a bunch of runaround answers without actually dealing with the issue.  only the ndp have gotten back to them and sat down for discussions, but they are pretty powerless at the moment to force any change in policy to get the government to start allocating the money properly.",liberals

gqbh6nv,2021-03-08T19:58:06.000-08:00,"a social conservative group plans to force the conservative party to change its position on abortion. here’s how this is why the cpc will not be getting my vote anytime soon.

i am the classic type of guy they would consider a core voter - white, male, upper middle class income, homeowner, small business, invested in the market. yet they somehow manage to shoot themselves in the foot by taking dumb to outright horrifying stances on climate change, lgbtq, and literally any social issue.

they have set themselves up to be a minority party for the foreseeable future. most of the country - even their own party members - will consider them unelectable until they jettison these nut jobs.",conservatives
gqbhcyt,2021-03-08T20:00:23.000-08:00,"o’toole’s in a fight to keep control of a party bent on fighting itself &gt; well the 'trudeau bad' is a position that is widely held by the silent majority of canadians not living in a big city.

the silent majority living outside of the big city (!? what is this \"silent majority\" anyways?) that didn't really help the cpc achieve really anything except a minority for the liberals where they're still thriving. next election, liberals get a majority more than likely. 

 &gt; the ones that go to work, have the audacity to save a little money and live as responsibly as they can and enjoy seeing canadians in other provinces have a robust economy. 

such an ignorant comment overall (are you just joshin me?), but this part moreso. are you trying to say that canadians living in the city don't matter and don't work and don't contribute to the economy? i'm typing this during a morning dump, but i'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the majority of canadians live in urban and suburban areas and contribute just fine to the economy compared to those that don't. 

&gt; funny you using 'projection' the way you did.

and you really don't know how to use projection
