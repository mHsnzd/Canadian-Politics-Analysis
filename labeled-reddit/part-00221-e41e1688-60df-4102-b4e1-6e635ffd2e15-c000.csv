[this article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/27/1027350/anming-hu-china-initiative-research-espionage-spying/) gets into the details of one case:

&gt;hu, a chinese-born canadian citizen, is a celebrated researcher in nanotechnology. in 2013, the university of tennessee recruited him to teach and continue his research. hu disclosed on multiple occasions that he’d worked part time teaching graduate students and researchers at the beijing university of technology, according to the knoxville news sentinel.

&gt;none of this raised any issues at the time. when hu began collaborating with nasa, which is legally barred from funding any research that involves “participation, collaboration, or coordination” with “china or a chinese-owned corporation,” ut administrators assured both him and the government agency that this part-time work didn’t violate the restriction. the law is meant to apply to nasa, not to its research collaborators.

&gt;in 2018, however, the fbi identified hu as a potential spy. during his court testimonial, agent sadiku said he had found and made a “rough translation” via google of a chinese-language news release and flier that suggested hu had once received a short-term contract from the thousand talents program. that was evidence enough for sadiku to open up a formal probe.

&gt;during sadiku’s first visit to hu’s office, hu says, the agent tried to get him to admit to involvement in a talent program. 

&gt;“they said, ‘you are so smart. you should be in the thousand talents program,’” he recounted during his trial. “i say, ‘i’m not that smart.’”

&gt;sadiku also tried to persuade him to become a spy for the us government, using his beijing university work as a cover. hu declined via email after sadiku’s visit. after this, sadiku doubled down on his investigation, placing hu and his son—then a freshman at ut—under surveillance.",liberals

i'm all for judging prime ministers within a contemporary historical context. my problem with macdonald was his national policy, which was way too protectionist, and the pacific scandal, where he literally took bribes.

while he is controversial for other things, such as the execution of louis riel, the establishment of residential schools, and the chinese head tax, i am more sympathetic to why he did it even though i find the policies abhorrent.

laurier's disenfranchisement of the indigenous was a dark spot for sure, but again, man of his time unfortunately. with pearson, at least he was the one who started the process to [decriminalize homosexuality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_klippert): progress happens in small steps.

&gt;chretien essentially did nothing during his term in office except occupy it. oh, he balanced the budget? well, yes, but not so much on purpose as coincidentally. when the world recession ended money poured into federal coffers from the gst he had campaigned against. and since the tories were divided he saw no reason to spend money to buy votes (which is why liberals usually spend money) so he let martin use it to pay down the debt, keeping his powder dry, so to speak, for when it might be needed. once the conservative split ended chretien then began to spend money hand over fist until martin booted him out. then martin spent money hand over fist.

lol they consistently posted surpluses - some as high as $20bn - since 1997, and were the first to do so since the 1960s. there wasn't a deficit until another recession hit in 2008, and we've been posting them ever since with trudeau going as high as $20bn year over year pre-covid despite an economic boom. i don't think you're giving them enough credit, especially by claiming they spent money hand over fist when they actually cut tons of services and funding. in fact, it's a miracle that they were able to fix things without triggering a recession; they also weathered the 2001 recession.it wasn't really 'coincidental' either, since canada almost entered into a debt crisis at 65% of gdp and their hand was forced. mulroney didn't stop posting $30bn deficits throughout his 9 years in office and just contributed to the problem. 

staying out of iraq was a smart move too, as was keeping the country united despite extreme quebec nationalism.

the buck ultimately stops with chretien, as it did with mulroney, harper and trudeau. was he perfect? of course not; i prefer harper anyday. but for a liberal pm, he was pretty good; better than either trudeau by 1000%. he didn't really fuck anything up.",liberals

hnp3moz,2021-12-07T16:38:00.000-08:00,"why conservatives are terrified to give teens the vote the youth are overwhelmingly left of centre. that’s less useful in canada because of vote splitting among 3-4 parties. the left of centre can win 70% of the youth vote, and yet the cpc can still win among the youth. 




in the us, the youth are overwhelmingly voting democrat. maga kids are a small, loud minority. those aged 18-29 votes 61% to 36% in favour of biden against trump. that’s a massive 25% margin of victory for democrats against those maga kids. and the us is way more conservative than canada, so we can expect canadian youth to be centre left in higher numbers. 



biden also won among those 30-44 by 11 points (54% to 43%). the idea that the youth aren’t overwhelmingly left of centre because maga kids exist, is just plain wrong.",conservatives
