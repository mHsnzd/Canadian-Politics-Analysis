he kept businesses open as long as he possibly could, kept kids in school so parents can work and make money for as long as he could.

if we evaluate countries that are through this mess, like australia, they had more leadership from a federal level, their pm stepped up and closed borders, stopped all air travel and didn’t leave their provinces to fend for themselves.

so please, share with me somewhere in the world that is doing a better job, that has lower cases than ontario does per 100,000 and i would love to have this discussion. i am not saying that he’s done a great job because he hasn’t but no one has better solutions than to criticize which i’m game for but hold all politicians accountable, and please save the federal doesn’t involve with provincial nonesense, trudeau has the power to do certain things like close all borders, implement mandatory rapid testing upon arrival etc.",liberals

i have no idea what you’re trying to say here. but to explain: ghg emissions are a global problem. canada emits a small fraction of global ghgs. reducing canada’s ghgs would have done little to stop climate change. for emissions reduction efforts to have any hope of success, they require cooperative effort from all countries. we’re getting something close to that under the paris agreement, but even with that kind of cooperation, our emissions, globally, are increasing. tell me what you think the end result, from a climate perspective, would have been if canada had imposed a carbon tax in 2007. it wouldn’t have stopped climate change, that’s for sure. 

&gt; there was no alternatives?

in terms of technology, no. solar and wind were incredibly expensive. even now, after massive cost reductions driven by much larger markets starting to integrate those technologies into their power supply, they remain expensive because of intermittency and the need to either overbuild or install batteries (although the cost of generation can be quite low depending where you are). 

&gt; bc started their carbon tax in 2008 and it was successful, so i reject your notion. 

reject it all you want, that doesn’t make you right. bc’s carbon tax resulted in a 0.5% reduction since 2007 and they would have an easier time integrating alternative solutions into their power sector because of their hydro resources. it also helps that most of their population lives in a temperate region and doesn’t need to use as much energy to heat their homes or businesses. but even if we assume that the rest of canada would have achieved as much success as bc had there been a national price on ghgs, it wouldn’t have had a meaningful impact on our emissions as a nation. in 2007, canada emitted 742 mt ([source](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html)). a 0.5% reduction would have led to reductions of around 3.7 mt. how big of an impact on the global climate would that have had? a rounding error above zero.

maybe the rate would have increased over time, but unless there are viable alternatives that we can drive consumers towards, you won’t achieve much in the way of reductions. through most of that period, there weren’t any real alternatives because the technology was still being developed. having a country like canada be an early mover wouldn’t have noticeably accelerated the rate of development because we’re a small market.",conservatives

basically higgs gets better numbers when the pandemic is the main focus of the day, but once we get into healthcare, housing, or other concerns, they lose points. a bit like last election; higgs got his majority by advance poll votes and bragging about his pandemic record, but the more he talked about anything else, the less people like what they were hearing. 

-pa dropping like flies. understandable given that the pcs hog all the attention due to covid, but also it's harder to show your usefulness when the governing party no longer depends on you to pass their bills. it is possible that much of this vote transfers to the pcs, but we'll see. regardless, i think austin's seat is safe for the time being. 

-ndp vote is not believable at all. they won't get more than 1%. the remaining 7% will transfer to the greens or/and liberals. 

-green vote staying put. quite remarkable that it is staying put due to relative opposition invisibility, but that's good news for them.

-libs hovering at 28% is unsurprising. they don't have a new leader yet, and their fate at next election will very much depend on who will lead them next. vickers was a shit communicator, a shit debater and had zero charisma or political experience. it shouldn't be that hard to beat that record. 

new brunswick vote is terribly inefficient. it is easy to forget that the pcs only got a razor thin majority of 2 seats with 39% last time, and with some close results in moncton and fredricton. and with stewart leaving for federal politics, and murmurs of retirement from provincial politics as well...it wouldn't take much for the pcs to lose that majority. new brunswickers are amongst the most fickle voters as well. we'll probably have an interesting campaign next time around.",liberals

&gt; mental health and addiction were serious problems long before covid hit. after a year of lockdowns made them worse, these are crises that our government needs to address. canadians are suffering and dying. it’s time for real action - and a new approach. canada’s conservatives will introduce the canada mental health action plan that will:

&gt; * propose to the provinces that they partner with us by dedicating a significant portion of the stable, predictable health funding to mental health to ensure that an additional million canadians can receive mental health treatment every year;

&gt; * encourage employers to add mental health coverage to their employee benefit plans by offering a tax credit for 25% of the cost of additional mental health coverage for the first three years;

&gt; * create a pilot program to provide $150 million over three years in grants to non-profits and charities delivering mental health and wellness programming; and

&gt; * create a nationwide three-digit suicide prevention hotline.

&gt; **supporting canadians suffering from addiction**

&gt; canada’s conservatives will treat the opioid epidemic as the health issue that it is. we believe that law enforcement should focus on dealers and traffickers. the last thing that those suffering from addiction should have to worry about is being arrested. any interaction the government has with them should focus on keeping them safe and helping them recover.

&gt; to help more canadians recover from addiction, canada’s conservatives will revise the federal government’s substance abuse policy framework to make recovery its overarching goal. we will reorient the canadian drugs and substances strategy towards ensuring that everyone suffering from addiction has the opportunity to recover and to lead a drug-free life and that all policies that fall under the strategy have the reduction of harm and promotion of recovery as their objectives. to realize this goal, we will:

&gt; * invest $325 million over the next three years to create 1,000 residential drug treatment beds and build 50 recovery community centres across the country.

&gt; * * this will give spaces to those who suffer from addiction, their families, and those who have recovered where they can get the help they need and support each other.

&gt; * support innovative approaches to address the crises of mental health challenges and addiction, such as land-based treatment programs developed and managed by indigenous communities as part of a plan to enhance the delivery of culturally appropriate addictions treatment and prevention services in first nations communities with high needs.

&gt; * partner with the provinces to ensure that naloxone kits are available for free across canada.",conservatives

i've adopted some of my terminology from the quebec culture and separation debate. i list myself as a \"nationalist\" rather that a separatist or sovereigntist because while i think we in the west form a unique political and cultural polity that's separate from the rest of canada, i'm not averse to remaining in canada as long as there's a better deal in place for us. i kinda spilled my guts on my preferences for alberta, the west and canada [in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadianconservative/comments/ozwmp5/the_west_wants_out_separatist_sentiments_growing/h82ort2/?context=3) a couple of weeks ago.

i think the west needs a party like maverick that's there for our interests only and isn't afraid to use separatism for leverage and if necessary an escape hatch. i think some of the o'toole conservatives policy positions have swung too far to the ontario point of view. i'm especially pissed off that bill c-69 will be allowed to live on. it's a gross overreach of federal power.

as for anything economic, i prefer the western ethos of self reliance and laissez faire rather than a lot of government push-pull. and that's what i expect the marvericks to protect. that said there is some room for a bit of intervention, like with the provincial governments oilsands innovation initiatives. at least one of which, carbon fibre, could lead to more manufacturing. same goes for ilp's heartland polyethylene plant. i'm not really into picking industries. there's a lot sound economic reasoning as to why we don't manufacture a lot here (mostly to do with distance from markets and cost of labour), but i look forward to continuing to reap the benefits of the oil and gas industry while we diversify. alberta's deregulated power industry is helping develop a lot of renewable capacity with a minimum of government coddling (unlike mcguinty ontario) and our tech sector has some very promising green shoots right now too and we may be well positioned as a site for vertical farming.",conservatives

part of the problem is that the canadian media don't explain their editorial choices. i watched cbc's coverage of trudeau's visit to rideau hall and i found rosemary barton's brief interjection on the topic quite jarring and poorly explained. here's what she said:

&gt; we are waiting for the prime minister to arrive, but after his chat with mary simon, he'll be kicking off his campaign as the liberal leader. still the prime minister, but we'll call him \"the liberal leader\" during that time, once that happens.

surely — in a 4 hour special — she &amp; the producers could take the time to at least *explain* the cbc's **editorial policy** of not respecting his official title as *prime minister*. that \"because mommy says so\" approach is unbecoming of a national broadcaster. to me it really speaks to the low view that cbc takes of canadians at large, rather than treating them as adults capable of a mature discussion of *why* something is being done.

this just confuses canadians about how government works. given the [recent unconstitutional demand by the green party leader](https://globalnews.ca/video/8117039/canada-election-2021-green-leader-annamie-paul-pushes-for-recall-of-parliament-over-afghanistan-crisis), news media really should be taking greater pains to explain how the system actually works.",liberals

\\- every municipality in every province has had housing run ups of unheard of proportions...

however, i feel like this is a distraction from the main issue.  to me the lesson is that canadian society is not much different than in the days of residential schools.  people were aware that they were issues, but they always found a way to make excuses:

* oh, those people don't deserve any better:  they are flawed in these ways.
* oh, even more of them would have died if they were still at home on the reserve.
* oh, we already spend so much money on them, it's just a big money pit.

when the fact of the matter was that canada signed treaties promising a proper education, but they underfunded things so severely that none of the residential schools provided sufficient food, provided sufficient protection from disease/ medical care, or provided enough money to attract staff with options.

and even the canadians that realized that residential schools were immoral never made this into a major election issue.

i see the same dynamic at play today with various issues like continuous boil water advisories.  people resent having tax money diverted to reserves.  they blame first nations people for their problems.  they drastically overestimate how much money is spent on reserves and first nations people.  and even though some canadians don't think like this, they never make it a key election issue.  the liberals have not done a good job on this file.  are they suffering any political fallout?  i'd have to say no.

so anyways, i'd like for canada to see this as a reason to examine our attitudes and change for the better.

i think a lot of people don't want to self-reflect as canadians, and are quite happy to put all the blame on the catholic church.  and if they aren't catholic, that sort of absolves themselves from feeling any responsibility.",liberals

major differences would still exist between english provinces about rights and constitution. the myth of one unified english canada is a lie. remember, english provinces are the ones responsible for the existence of the nwc. 

&gt;barriers up when it comes to promoting on merit in the civil service or having a diverse supreme court.

aaaaand this is why there still remains tensions in this country. some anglophones are trying their hardest to pit linguistic equality against diversity and merit, as if they're not compatible with each other. well they are, and we don't appreciate our rights being twisted into an anti-diversity and anti-meritocratic narrative. 

furthermore, our rights as francophones to keep official bilingualism and linguistic duality wouldn't suddenly stop being relevant in the event of québec leaving. canada still would be under the duty to uphold those, regardless of whether the politicians would do the right thing or not. i'm skeptical that they would, but it doesn't detract from the fact that they should. 


&gt;quebec separatism solves a lot of canada's problems. it may lead to other difficulties, but they are less insurmountable.

on the contrary. if québec leaves, it emboldens anti-french anglophones everywhere in canada to stop official federal bilingualism, and that extremist crowd in new brunswick to do the same provincially. and if this happens, new brunswick would make northern ireland look like a bastion of peace. as francophone minorities, we will never accept to lose our linguistic rights or accept the illegitimacy of anglo dominance over us. the tensions would be such that you'd risk civil war. 

and it wouldn't just blow up with french canadians outside québec, it would blow up with indigenous nations and confederacies across the country, many of whom span various provinces (québec + others). they see both québec and canada as illegitimate colonies that, with the us,  split up their nations with borders, and who occupy what they see as their lands. you'd risk oka crises everywhere over land disputes. indigenous communities didn't massively vote no in 1995 to endorse canada, they did so to preserve their nation's territorial integrity.

&gt;throughout the 1950s, canada repeatedly voted against or abstained from resolutions condemning the racism of apartheid at the united nations. canada also refused to sign the 1973 un convention on the suppression and punishment of the crime of apartheid; like other western states opposed to the convention, canada was worried that its own citizens and corporations might face prosecution for aiding and abetting apartheid.

&gt;canadian companies, such as bata shoes, which had two plants in the kwazulu bantustan, took advantage of the low wages made possible by racist subjugation of black south africans, and influential actors in the private sector advocated “constructive engagement” with apartheid rather than divestment. until the mid-1980s, canadian mps went on trips to south africa sponsored by the south african government, and returned full of praises for its system of rule.",liberals

which actually may not be the best case. the best case might be for them to hold the libs to a very weak minority, and then sit back for a year, learn from this one and get even stronger, and watch as inflation goes crazy and the economy suffers and the libs have to wear it. there will also be pressure on trudeau to resign and that will create fissures within the party. then in 18 months force an election and swing for a majority. if people are sick of the libs now, they'll be fed to the back teeth with them then.

alberta has also received a fair amount of funding outside of equalization, which has helped attribute a higher standard of living in alberta and sask.

equalization is just a buzzword that is an easy target to rile up the west, but we need to be better than this. looking at the numbers at face value looks bad, but if we take in more variables, it's not as unfair as at first glance.

alberta's economy has also been based primarily in an industry that the world wants to step away from. there were going to be growing pains, and unfortunately the pandemic happened on top of that. alberta was a ship that was poised to sink at any moment, we are just feeling that now. it's very unfortunate that people have lost their jobs, but as the economy shifts, new jobs will be made. just like it has throughout history. i empathize with those suffering layoffs and all the stress that creates both mentally and financially, but things will get better, or they won't. but if they don't, it means the world is on the verge of going through a major change for the worse. lol

it also doesn't make any sense that it's just an individual and not a societal issue. i'd challenge you to name something that you think is a collective issue and differentiate it from racism. racists are made, not born. they learn it from society, whether it's from parents, peers, or media. it's good that you at least realize there are systemic differences and while the equation has many variables, racism is certainly one of them. that's why we have issues like blacks being sentenced to longer prison terms than whites for the same crime, and of course being more likely to be killed in police encounters than whites in similar ones. but it's a factor we can try to mitigate.",liberals

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; to implement a national pharamacare plan, the federal government must begin negotiations with the provinces and develop a plan for program deliverance and transfer payments. since health care delivery rests primarily with the provinces, this attempt at cooperative federalism must be negotiated successfully for a national program to be initiated. 

 

&gt;[cooperative federalism](https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/index.php/cd/1026-co-operative-federalism) is a concept “premised on federal and provincial governments working collectively to achieve mutual policy objectives.”[\\[12\\]](https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/2019/07/a-national-pharmacare-plan-requires-cooperative-federalism/#_ftn12) collaboration allows the federal government and the provinces to not be stuck in their “watertight compartments” but to instead implement innovative policies by working together. in some ways, this is necessary in a federal state – life is complicated and is not easily categorized and divided into separate areas of jurisdiction for federal and provincial governments. according to the supreme court of canada: “seeking cooperative solutions that meet the needs of the country… is supported by the canadian constitutional principles and by the practice adopted by the federal and provincial governments.”[\\[13\\]](https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/2019/07/a-national-pharmacare-plan-requires-cooperative-federalism/#_ftn13)  
&gt;  
&gt;as previously mentioned, since health care is a provincial responsibility, negotiations and cooperative federalism is necessary for there to be a functioning national pharmacare program.

i think you underestimate just how many more drugs would be sold.  sure you'd see a reduction in prices with bulk buying, but we're talking about the government footing the bill for people who can't afford drugs and therefore aren't buying them.

put it this way, would you rather make 1,000 sales and make a whole dollar off of profit off every sale?   or would you rather make 10,000 sales and make only 75 cents of profit on every sale?

**************
the reason pharmacare is such a big hurdle isn't the boogeyman stereotype of the \"the corporations\".  it's that it is a crap ton of money that the federal government would have to shell out and therefore raise taxes by a lot to cover it.

and pharmacare proponents argue that there would be even greater cost savings.  which i assume is true, but here's the catch: *the savings aren't to the federal government*, the savings are to the economy as a whole.   i.e. we as a country do better and we're all better off, but taxes go up.   this is a hard sell politically because diffuse distributed benefits which are hard to prove aren't appreciated by voters as much as concrete and obvious tax increases are disliked.",liberals

so, progressives have a tendency to lose elections (especially under fptp) but not necessarily the broader social argument as conservatives, especially ones respecting public opinion, will often adopt enough progressive policies to retain power. germany has been run by christian conservatives for the last ... 20 years? ... but eventually bent on gay marriage when public opinion bent against them.

i think feed is right in that those that vote cpc were going to pick the cpc has best in everything, and with the cpc being so high with mainstreet, it pushes them to the top on almost everything.

however the really interesting parts of this poll are the lpc/ndp percentages, and it's not good for the lpc. on 3, 4, and 6 the lpc is well below their polling numbers, with seemingly the ndp benefitting. if enough lpc voters see the ndp as being better on these issues, which are key issues, it may persuade them to just vote for the ndp instead.  i know it's early and it's hard to tell, but this may be the first sign of a potential ndp surge.",liberals

- revise the tax code to disincentivize speculation (via prohibitive taxes on properties flipped within 2 years) and impose a moratorium on foreign ownership.  

- beef up fintrac budgets and tackle money laundering issues — prohibit international students from purchasing real estate (i know a branch in kingston who counted $80 million in wire transfers from international students)

- pass legislation prohibiting blind bidding practices in real estate.

the reality is; if the lpc cared remotely about housing costs they would have done *something* resembling even *one* of the initiatives above.

&gt;the problem with court's opinions is that it's the personal opinion of the judges who are not perfect human beings and in a democracy, ultimately the people's will has to count for something. 

it is the legal opinion of multiple experts at multiple court levels. this is how the judiciary works, and if we can't have faith in that process then we have much bigger problems as a democracy. this system worked perfectly fine for ford the last time the issue came up. before he could even enact the notwithstanding clause, the appeals court struck down the lower court ruling in time for him to enact his original law. 

&gt;democracy should mean everyone's opinion matters, when courts are supreme, it means people's opinion don't really matter, only judges' opinions do.

legislators pass laws, presumably based on voter mandates. judges interpret those laws. voters' opinions are not being erased. the constitutional rights are also laws passed by legislators. this is a case of a government overriding those fundamental rights enacted on behalf of voters.

&gt;i've noticed a mindset that the \"majority\" is dubious and inherently oppressive that is very popular in canada, especially in those educated after the adoption of the charter. the idea that democratic institutions are a threat to people's rights rather than protective of them is very frightening, because it leads directly into anti-democratic thinking.

constitutions are not a uniquely canadian thing. their purpose is to acknowledge that there are certain fundamental rights that should be more important than ever changing popular opinion of the current governing party. history has very clearly showed us that the majority often does not have the best interests of smaller groups. 

an example is various conservative viewpoints being minority opinions in canada. these should still be protected despite that, but if we make it commonplace for legislatures to ignore charter rights, these could be the next unpopular things to be subject to s. 33.",liberals

i suppose, hypothetically, a government could invoke the notwithstanding clause to pass legislation ignoring sections 7 and 9 and start rounding up their political opponents or something like that, but in a situation where any government had the support to do that, and wanted to, we'd have bigger things to worry about than whether what they're doing is technically legal.",liberals

i must say though, i’m not as optimistic about the ndp’s chances as they apparently seem to be. 

this is horwaths fourth kick at the can and i think voters are a little tired of seeing her try to win, although as official opposition voters might see them as more capable than the liberals. 

their policies so far have also been a a bit odd for a party so close to winning government. they seem to have doubled-down on high-spending and heavy-handed government initiatives that i’m sure the pc’s are practically teeming with excitement to hit them with attack ads over. 

for example, their environmental plan changes the ontario carbon pricing system *again* and uses almost all the revenue for government spending, which implies the elimination of the progressive carbon rebate. you can call it bold or foolish, but i don’t think voters will digest it well. 

the progressive vote will need to get behind either the ndp or the liberals in order to beat ford. the only advantage i see for the ndp compared to the liberals are the fact that they are official opposition and have decent fundraising numbers. the liberals on the other hand have greater appeal in the 905, less left-wing policies, and experienced political advisors that have won elections.

quebec legitimized the use of s.33 by invoking it constantly, and now other provinces feel emboldened, weakening the charter significantly. a better option would have been to give quebec more control over language and culture in the 1982 constitution instead of giving them a loophole.

h1zcwty,2021-06-16T02:03:15.000-07:00,"doug ford has joined the attack on the constitution. why won’t justin trudeau fight back? &gt;it is the legal opinion of multiple experts at multiple court levels. this is how the judiciary works, and if we can't have faith in that process then we have much bigger problems as a democracy. 

if people can't disagree with the opinion of a few unaccountable \"experts\" and reverse it, then we have even much bigger problems, because we'd no longer even be a democracy.

&gt;legislators pass laws, presumably based on voter mandates. judges interpret those laws. voters' opinions are not being erased. the constitutional rights are also laws passed by legislators. this is a case of a government overriding those fundamental rights enacted on behalf of voters.

it's a mess because of the charter. the canadian legal and parliamentary system doesn't know what it is because of the charter. in common law jurisdictions, judges make laws through their rulings but must yield to statutory laws by parliament, and if parliament doesn't like how judges interpret the law, then they have the power to modify existing laws or enact new laws to force judges to accept parliament's interpretation, and judges have no right to invalidate parliament acts. the charter just screwed everything up and made the canadian system into something that is not particularly coherent.

we don't recognize popular sovereignty, and sovereignty is assumed to be owned by parliaments, which can change the constitution if they just agree with it without consulting anyone else, but courts are supreme and can invalidate acts of parliament, though parliaments are still somehow sovereign and they have the notwithstanding clause...

nothing about the canadian system is coherent or rational.

&gt;constitutions are not a uniquely canadian thing. their purpose is to acknowledge that there are certain fundamental rights that should be more important than ever changing popular opinion of the current governing party.

every country has a constitution, written or not. some are rigid, some are flexible. not all constitutions include highly subjective bills of rights. constitutions are mainly about establishing the structures under which a country is governed, how they are set up, how people are appointed, the relationship between one another. rights are sometimes included, but not always. it is greatly reductionist to claim constitutions are only about rights, that's not even their primary reason for existing.

&gt;history has very clearly showed us that the majority often does not have the best interests of smaller groups.

history has examples for whatever you want to argue for. the fact that the rights of minorities in canada are not particularly more advanced than that in countries like the uk, new zealand, the netherlands and australia where there is no bill of rights courts can use to invalidate acts of parliament shows that the fear that only the charter protects minorities against the big bad majority is not correct. furthermore, courts only do their job of protecting rights when people agree to let them do so, because if the majority really elected a government that wanted to oppress minorities, it could just ignore the rulings from the courts.

the only reason charter cases are a main vehicle for advancement of minorities' rights in canada is that canadian politicians have largely abandoned the issue since the charter, they leave it to the courts rather than do their traditional job.",liberals

furthermore, i disagree, the ucp *would not* cut the *wages* of **soldiers**, they’d cut their pensions, healthcare, housing and all of the services to **veterans**. that distinction is important. the ucp have had no problem paying extremely *useless* men extravagant salaries to do nonsense jobs. (war room, commissioner steve allan, harper’s 22 year old son’s six figure salary etc etc etc) they like anyone who is “fighting” for their “side”.  their “logic” is bullshit, nonsensical and illogical, but they can justify it to their side. just like they’ll justify the inevitably  scandalous salaries they’ll end up paying some patronage appointment health “administrator” who turns out to be a ucp insider but can’t justify a “penny more” on healthcare otherwise.

to me, this:

&gt; anyone who knows the ucp well, knows that

sounds like groupthink reverse engineering. the ucp are wildly incompetent, half the time the ucp doesn’t know what the ucp is doing. they’re led by a college dropout who’s never held a real job and is a “confirmed bachelor”. it’s really a bunch of blind hogs stumbling around vaguely smelling food in one direction. the “scent” in this case being their extreme ideology.",conservatives

hcqlqwz,2021-09-13T07:01:30.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - monday, september 13, 2021 imo the main political goal of the rest of us who aren't diehard liberal and conservative partisans who value their parties' stranglehold on power over the democratic health of country should be to keep any government to minority status until the ruling political class in the two major parties is willing to come to the table on electoral reform or need to out of sheer strategic necessity.

electoral reform may not be widely popular in the electorate as defenders of inaction on electoral reform always tell us, but it may very well be popular enough among a key group of liberal/ndp swing voters (who know very well the demoralization of strategic voting and are sick of it) for it to become a major problem for the liberals going forward. they continue to demand our votes after betraying us on it and not taking the urgent action our society needs — how long do they think this same playbook is going to keep working? how long until enough people get fed up by being treated in that way and wont swing their vote to them anymore?

given how ridiculously absurdly small the percentages are that determine minority/majority in this country electoral reform doesn't need to be widely popular for it to be a problem for the liberals, just a few small extra percentage points of ndp/liberal swing voters need to get fed up and stop playing the strategic voting game for it to have major impacts on the liberal's ability to form majorities going forward.

i'll hit on the easy one first. communism is a single state run government where there is no private ownership, everyone is assigned work to the state's needs and is paid a \"fair\" wage. he has made zero steps in this direction.

how is the pandemic mismanaged? we are dealing with an unknown that is constantly changing which makes reacting very difficult. does the federal government have the authority to force all provinces to react in the same way? the mismanagement seems to come as no province can \"agree\" on what the correct steps are. so far the \"best\" plan seems to come from the covid zero plan. i bet if the pandemic was more cohesive with federal government oversight then the common complaint would be the federal government overstepping their jurisdiction.

vaccines are manufactured elsewhere (not in canada). we were at the mercy of paying for priority and to this day have one of the highest vaccine rollouts in the world. stole from the international vaccine program? i would need to see a credible link on this. trudeau had pressure to do whatever was necessary to keep his country going and that meant getting vaccine asap to get back to normalcy.

the mask and general coronavirus health information comes from the cdc and the federal government just relays that information.

in regards to inflation, there is no easy answer. the economy is current at record highs running on the tech sector and stimulus which is puzzling since the economy has been at a standstill for so long.

canada's fiscal policy generally has to stay lock-step in maintaining a healthy 0.7 - 0.8 peg to the us dollar and needs to react as such even with their wild spending policies. when parity is approached that leads to trade agreements falling apart which another issue entirely. the federal government does have control of the one lever to help curve inflation and that is to increase interest rates, but unfortunately in a fragile economy that we have now that can cause another world of pain (aka no easy answer).

additionally, coronavirus has disrupted supply changes immensely. this has caused the price of goods to skyrocket as these prices are absorbed at the consumer level. this comes in combination with severe weather which is also taking a toll on food supply.",liberals

this inflation is almost _entirely_ due to supply issues. from manufacturing, to shipping, to storage and delivery. try getting a part for _anything_ in your house these days. it's not because everybody decided to repair their dishwasher or add a new breaker panel at once -- it's because the stuff does not exist to sell to people, so prices go up. you can't get a bicycle. you can't even get a lot of new cars at the moment. that's not a monetary policy issue, that's supply.

lumber companies turned down supply in 2020, expecting a housing crash when the opposite happened. that demand was millennials finally entering the market because they weren't spending money anywhere else.

food rotted in the fields as migrant workers could not be moved in to pick it, so supply was down and prices went up.

furthermore, wanzhou passed through several other counties with us extradition before coming to canada, it was only when she arrived here that us officials struck. the reason for this is pretty obvious - other countries would have said no. european countries tend to look skeptically on us extradition requests that are politically motivated, while a mexican official quoted in the globe and mail had a good laugh at the idea that mexico would have extradited a high-level chinese national for trump's political gain. essentially, canada is the only nation that would rubber-stamp something like this for the us. based on reporting, it seems likely that our political leadership did not fully understand what was happening and was essentially duped.",liberals

all of the above ignores the fact that xi-era china is explicitly hostile towards those that don't bend their line inside their country and outside of it.

we aren't getting the michaels back, so knowing that the best way for canada to move on here is to accept that this china is hostile to our interests and act accordingly. give those fleeing hong kong asylum, kick huawei completely out of the country and ban their equipment from use here, do not allow their parastatals any involvement in the canadian economy and once meng runs out of ways to appeal extradition send her to washington to face trial.

and before anybody plays the race card on me, asian-canadians should be recruited as much as possible to find out about china's actions here and any non-chinese canadians who want to be bigots should have charges pressed against them. we need them on our side if we want to avoid the problems the ccp's leadership is very likely at this point to cause.",liberals
