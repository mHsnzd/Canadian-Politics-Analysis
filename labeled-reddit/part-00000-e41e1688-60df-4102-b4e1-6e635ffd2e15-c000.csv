* ghg emissions
* renewable energy
* energy use (efficiency)
* climate policy

where canada continues to have issues is the first three. however, canada has had sizeable improvements in the last category over the last several years. in 2015 - which was the last year that harper was in power - the [ccpi had canada in the worst category for policy](https://germanwatch.org/sites/germanwatch.org/files/publication/10407.pdf) (there doesn't seem to be a table that specifically captures rankings based on policy for this year like the subsequent ones, but the sliver allocated to use in the main bar chart is tiny). in 2021, [canada now ranks 29 out of 61](https://ccpi.org/download/the-climate-change-performance-index-2021/). not the best, but well away from the bottom. (as the latest report was published in december 2020, i'm not sure if it takes into account the [recent policy announcements](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/net-zero-carbon-climate-trudeau-1.5838736) that were made in mid-december). 

(one aside, i have a few issues on how the renewable energy category is weighted. [82% of canada's energy](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/data-analysis/energy-data-analysis/energy-facts/electricity-facts/20068) is non ghg emitting - 15% of which is nuclear - , and 60% of that is hydro. having australia higher on the list than us in this category, when it gets like [90% of its energy consumption](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/basics#:~:text=australia's%20primary%20energy%20consumption%20is,around%20(2%20per%20cent)) comes from coal, oil and gas seems a bit off. i think this category is more directed to expansion rather than current use, but that still seems somewhat misleading). 

so - could the liberals be doing better on the climate file? for sure. our overall ghg emissions are still high, and we could be doing more with regards to renewable energy and how we use it. however, it appears that gains have been made on the policy side of things, which should have an impact on the other categories (though this may take some time), and i'm not sure the evidence is there that the liberals are ideologically in bed with the oil industry.",liberals

\"for a free-market economy to work well (both for consumers and new businesses) you need competition. now if you can easily drive out competitors by having an unfair advantage, consumers will suffer.\" 

i disagree, competition tries to squash new businesses. thats what competition is, fighting to thrive. capitlaism is about making money, if there is more competition it is more difficult to make money because you have to compete with other companies. it is an incentive to try to monopolize industries because it will make those companies a lot of money, look at amazon, who else competes with them? take a look at telus and rogers, i think it is. its not a monopoly in the sense of only one company but is two companies that work together to corner a market. is that a monopoly? 

\"as a democratic government, it would be insane to allow unfair business practices because your citizens lose purchasing power and diversity.\" but isn't that a free market? i agree, it is insane what companies get away with, but you're saying you want a free market and then to have the government put restrictions on that market limiting its freedom. this is the problem with capitalism, it doesn't care about fairness, it cares about profit even if that means its a detriment to the people.

gk006sk,2021-01-20T07:07:34.000-08:00,"\"we are close friends, partners, and allies\": trudeau congratulates president biden | news it's not so simple. the fact of the matter is that oil is here to stay *for the foreseeable future* (whether that be 10, 20, or 50 years), so the question is what we do during that time. it's possible to recognize that we must transition away from fossil fuels, while also advocating for their most efficient use while they're still here. and make no mistake, pipelines are by a large margin the most efficient and safe way to transport them. the key word here is \"transition\", which necessarily implies that a change is going to happen over an extended period of time.

a good analogy is to think of cars on the road: in a way, what you're arguing is that we shouldn't increase the efficiency of internal combustion engines, but rather focus entirely on electric vehicles. now again, that's a good idea in theory, but if we do some simple calculations, we can see that that may not be the best way forward:

zero emission vehicles represent approximately 3% of current sales in canada, and their gain in market share is going to take time. so in the coming year, if we make a very aggressive assumption that they can increase their uptake by 33%, they've effectively removed 1% of our current vehicle emissions from the road (0.33x0.03=0.01). (this is drastically dumbed down, but the point remains). 

now, if we compare that to an increased fuel efficiency  of say 5% for regular internal combustion vehicles, whether through laws, mandates, grants, or what have you, you've effectively removed 5% of our current vehicle emissions from the road (0.05x0.97= about 0.05).

so we can see that, in the short term (using these assumptions), our best strategy is actually to focus on improving our regular internal combustion vehicles fuel efficiencies!

all this being said, that doesn't mean we can't do two things at once. we can use our current resources and energy sources as efficiently as possible, while also recognizing we need to transition away from them over time.",liberals

gk2px3e,2021-01-21T00:33:50.000-08:00,"with keystone xl back on the shelf, oilpatch pressure mounts on trudeau and trans mountain the trans mountain expansion project has faced a minefield of obstacles, but it looks like the trudeau government has gotten it past almost all of them. a key factor here was the notley government's support for climate policy from 2015 to 2019, as well as a solid federal climate policy stringent enough to meet canada's 2030 commitments. the [stakes are obviously high](https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/import/pdfs/misc/energy-pdfs-from-campaign-page/pipeline_approval_delays_the_costs_of_inaction_-_feb_20.pdf), especially now that biden has removed the hope of keystone xl eventually making it past us courts.

major obstacles:

  - public opinion in bc. in [june 2014](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-03/majority-in-b-c-want-harper-to-delay-or-kill-gateway), just before northern gateway was approved by harper, 67% of people in bc wanted it delayed or cancelled; only 33% supported it. in contrast, in [december 2019](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/british-columbians-more-supportive-of-trans-mountain-pipeline-poll-1.4746283), 56% of people in bc supported tmx, with 35% opposed.

  - opposition from the bc ndp government, particularly in early 2018, despite the previous bc government negotiating an agreement to support the project. this was resolved by (a) [trudeau buying the pipeline](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trevor-tombe-trans-mountain-federal-purchase-1.4683222) in may 2018, and (b) the 2019 federal election. in [an interview](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-a-pipeline-fight-with-quebec-may-be-looming/) shortly after the 2019 election, horgan said that the election results had settled the issue. (the federal ndp, which also opposes tmx, failed to take any seats from the liberals in bc, even in closely watched ridings like burnaby north - seymour.)

  - legal obstacles. trudeau's initial approval was appealed by first nations and environmental groups, and overturned by the federal court of appeal in august 2018. after doing additional phase 3 consultation with first nations, trudeau re-approved the project in june 2019. the federal court of appeal dismissed further appeals in february 2020, and the supreme court declined to hear appeals in july 2020. 

  - economic risk. shippers have made long-term contract commitments for the next 15-20 years, so if demand for oil and fuels were to unexpectedly collapse, they're the ones bearing the economic risk, not the tmx owner.

at this point there's still activists opposed to tmx who may try to stop it through civil disobedience, but supporters of the project can point out that the opponents have already had their day in court. the courts took their objections seriously, at one point stopping the project, but have now concluded that the project approval is reasonable.",liberals

incidentally, there are working examples of open prison systems in places like norway. yes, they still have max security prisons etc. but only the most severe kind of criminals are detained there. many criminals face time in \"open prisons\" where they are free to come and go. this helps make sure they are able to maintain employable skills and the system usually helps them obtain employable skills. there's really no reason not to do this right away with non-violent crime.

other methods involve changing the environment of prisons from a punishment into a mentorship. and while you might say that prison education programs in canada fulfill that role they don't really solve the underlying issue. instead, norway's method of using prison guards as role models rather than enforcers has done wonders in cutting recidivism likely for the same psychological reasons that spanking increases the likelihood of a kid growing up to become involved in crime.",liberals

the rules say that they need to *have a caucus wide vote on expelling mps*. so they need 50% of the caucus to support the decision.

what i think probably happened is that mps self-selected into groups prior to the meeting and they didn't just 'go around the table one at a time and gave everyone 2 minutes to speak.' that seems like a ridiculous assumption given the party has a leadership structure (a leader and the shadow cabinet) some of whom (o'toole) publicly said how they were voting ahead of time. this is absolutely a political decisions and i'd be curious to know who organized into what group. like most political votes -- politicians don't spontaneously decide how to vote after a debate. they have their own ideas and thoughts. some can be persuaded and others can't.

i suspect people had discussed it with one another prior to joining the zoom call. not doing so would be weird, in my opinion.

that you think the leader polling his own leadership team and the rest of the caucus prior to the vote is somehow a violation of reform act or the legal process by which they expel an mp is puzzling. (i'm assuming you infer this given the weird digression about o'toole might think). as i said, it would be insane for a leader to announce he was moving to expel someone with having no clue how many people would support him on that measure.

there is [canadian data](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234457) available and it does not support your *american* study's conclusion relative to our country.

the best thing we can say about the majority of canadians, is:

1. [they don't care either way beyond what's pushed by their political leaders](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23541920_the_politics_of_gun_control_comparing_canadian_and_american_patterns) (dated study, but its tables still appear valid based on today's numbers). did any one give a f*** when harper scrapped the lgr? nope. even the liberals aren't touching that again because everyone and their beaten-to-death horse know it was stupid.
2. the less knowledgeable about firearms and their laws, [the more supportive of bans or more laws they are.](http://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020.04.30_gun-control_pr-tables_extra.pdf) (i hate that word assault weapon because no one actually knows what it is and it's left to the reader's imagination.)
3. there is [broad support](https://globalnews.ca/news/6982152/canadians-gun-ban-ipsos-poll/) for an *assault weapons* ban, that is true.
4. [half of city folks want all firearms banned in canada](https://globalnews.ca/news/6893821/firearms-ban-ipsos-poll-canada/), so right off the bat about 1/4 opinions (15m living in those nine cities x 0.52 / 35m) on the matter are extreme regardless of firearm type. imo, that invalidates their opinion on this discussion because of its vacuous implication. 

regarding australia, though i won't say anything definitive because i don't follow british prison news often (i joke), there seems to be [conflict in the overall effectiveness](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/australia.php#appendix) of their various gun reforms. if we compare firearm homicide rates of australia to other countries, we see they effectively followed the trend of the rest of the [developed world](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/homicide-rates-from-firearms?tab=chart&amp;time=earliest..latest&amp;country=aus~aut~can~cze~dnk~fin~svk~swe~che~gbr~grc~deu). strangely enough, even as canada historically increased gun control, we haven't done nearly as well. clearly there are much bigger factors at play here that we should focus on before suggesting statistically irrelevant but politically safe solutions.

simply taking an ideological position of \"oil bad\" isn't a realistic, or even optimal solution. it's not immediately obvious that retaining less efficient and less safe methods of transporting alberta's oil (through rail, road transport, and old pipelines) rather than upgrading to modern, safer, and more efficient pipelines, is the right choice for the environment. to this point, i'm actually still agnostic, but ultimately my point is that these problems are much harder than most people make them out to be, and it's possible that some solutions *that sound bad at the surface* (such as building an updated pipeline) may actually turn out to be the best option.",liberals

- a card carrying conservative party member who legally donated a small amount of money to the leadership candidate of his choice. 
- that donor happens to be known for his stance on what appears to be racist and white supremacist ideology. 
- that donor’s legal first name does not match the name he is “known” by in the public realm. 

are the leadership candidates expected to be vetting everyone who donates small amounts of cash to them? probably made through some online portal, where they have no human interaction at all? doing a full background check, criminal history, reviewing all their social media posts? obviously that’s not a reasonable expectation. it’s not like the guy donated his home as a venue for a fundraiser, or had any confirmed association with derek personally. 

in some cases, a politician will make a show of “returning” a donation. usually it’s nothing more than posturing, an attempting to distance themselves. is it possible that derek’s personal values at least partially overlap with this donor? not a big stretch of the imagination. however, the standard we’re holding derek to is unreasonable in my opinion. just imagine the situation being flipped to someone else, who is likely legitimately unaware of who every single one of their donors are. 

it seems like o’toole is posturing to position the image of his own party in a certain light, or perhaps regretting his personal stance on previous (more egregious) occurrences of questionable decision making by derek sloan. perhaps he is just using this incident as something to “hang his hat on” so to speak, to justify his removal for another reason entirely. in any case, there doesn’t seem to be any level of accountability in erin both chiding derek for not being more aware of who his donors are, and being blissfully unaware (or ignorant) to the issue of him being an active party member in good standing.

this is the mindset that gets you to forced labour, unpaid firefighters, and every other form of cruel punishment we put prisoners through.

we basically create and maintain situations for crime to occur, things like poverty and homelessness. we make people desperate and unwell to the point where they commit a crime. people have no ability to defend themselves in the legal system and then we spend around $115,000 a year locking these people up. instead of fixing the underlying problems that lead to crimes. there is no reason for the majority of people to be incarcerated, it is a backwards system built to punish the poor and disenfranchised for having the misfortune of being born into a terrible situation or environment.

for mark rutte and vvd, the scandal doesn't appear to be particularly damaging - his party is at 25% in the polls (a commanding lead in the netherlands) and he will likely return as prime minister. it will probably result in some reforms for more direct provision supported by the labour and greenleft parties.

for the rest of us, it's another example of how complex income-based targetting, often hailed as good policy design, is actually bad policy design. complex targetting requires more bureaucracy to verify requirements and identify fraud. inevitably, this leads to mistakes, even in bureaucracies with a reputation for competency. moreover, conservatives often sharpen the obscure requirements for these programs, gradually chipping away at the welfare state and intentionally cutting more people out.",conservatives

secondly, because canadians have a tendency to wag their fingers at things that they're also guilty of. there are canadian mining companies doing horrible things in africa, there are also canadian companies doing horrible things in other countries like bangladesh. china is just a convenient scapegoat.

you are right that all decent humans should call out atrocities *anywwhere* they see them, around the world. to the other person's point, we indeed are more likely to be able to change things in canada than we are in china - but even that is naïve! random people in any country have limited power, and there are strong commercial vested interests in favour of keeping the status quo (e.g. the for-profit prison industry). so we should all be speaking out about our problems at home, and about problems world wide - even if we are citizens of a country that hasn't achieved perfection yet!

both of you need to stop attacking each other's points as less-important or not-valid, and realize your points both bolsters each other. they both fight for the same end goal.

1) he acted like a bull in a china shop, sidestepping the vetting committee and process introduced by stephen harper and giving this role to someone he liked the idea of without any apparently applying rigour or judgement to the selection. this plays into the idea of trudeau as reckless ideologue who ignores due process and throws caution into the wind when he wants to look like he's doing the right thing; and

2) he appears to have appointed the gg based on the boxes she ticked rather than any consideration of her actual, personal suitability for the role - something they've complained about more generally when it comes to his campaign to appoint minorities to important roles.

o’toole sees himself as canada’s trump (he literally has stated that his economic views are no different than trump’s) and sloan would fit right into it. the only reason why now he’s taking a stand is because denouncing white supremacists is “trendy” (even though the state literally (re)produces white supremacy) and publicly getting support from white supremacists looks bad. the liberal way is to do things fairly mask on — the cpc is fine with white supremacy (as they would uphold it), they’re just not fine with that knowledge being so overt. it would also turn off the more “progressive” conservatives who may not outwardly hate poor people or people of colour but still support policies that harm them.",conservatives

conservative party candidate from 2015 walter pamic said about o’toole’s pro union shift in rhetoric: “i’ve spoken to many business owners who are also, coincidentally, members of the party or support conservative values, and they’re not happy with it,” he said. “it doesn’t really seem to be a conservative principle.” 

he’s backing off from it because union members and those trying to unionize didn’t like it. it was the business owners that pushed for it. there’s no evidence of any widespread problems of unions making “enemy lists”. the grift is working on you.

i don’t actually disagree with o’toole - the leftist students that held up marxist posters and cried about the evils of capitalism, were often such in an echo chamber and could not thoroughly debate their opponents whatsoever. their way of protesting was to scream ‘shame’ or ‘racist, bigot, piece of shit, leave’ to speakers that challenged their viewpoints.

it depends on what the viewpoints being discussed are. you've just listed two counties, not every issue with either of them is free from bigotry or colonialism. what aspects are being discussed when these words are used in conversation?

peterson is not the folk hero you're trying to paint him as here. \"stood up to the mob,\" as if he didn't just peddle \"identity politics\" from the right's point of view. 

&gt;leftists don’t understand (and as exhibited by reddit user r/canamgirl) that there’s two ways to view issues.

vancouver has shifting demographics throughout the suburbs, with more people moving out from the core, chasing the dream of a backyard and driveway.

with trudeau polling where he is right now (you don't get to bash polls either), there is a fair reason to believe he will gain back seats in bc. i encountered a lot of people on the trail who specifically pointed to tmx and said they aren't voting lpc *because* of its approval. it hurt him bad on the left coast. 

another interesting poll i've seen recently is that the andp is absolutely crushing the ucp in alberta. and that was before kenney had to take the eggs that biden threw onto his face today.

but mulroney also lead a very different party in a very different time. keep in mind that, for instance, abortion had its opponents in both the liberal and conservative caucuses, so some socially conservative issues had not coalesced into purely a conservative problem. as well, the pcs didn't have the massive regional divide that the cpc has, that came in no small part because of the breakup of the pcs. the blow up saw the entrance of preston manning and the reform party, built on a platform of western grievance. when harper and mackay brought the tories back together, essentially the pc wing of the new party got swamped, and the manning wing gained control of the rudder, and it's been like that ever since. harper had the capacity to hold it together, but it leads to the question, is the cpc actually the stephen harper party, and without him at the helm, the weld job between reform and the pcs is coming apart?",conservatives

that's probably quite accurate which undermines mr. sloan's claim that it's about being a social conservative.   [relevant clip from the big lebowski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6byzliqkb8).

the mistake mr. sloan is making is confusing “straight answer” type of person with nasty confrontational attitude.   it's the difference between a person who responds directly to another who asks you to sign their petition that you won't sign because you strongly disagree with the petition, (as opposed to just ignoring him as many do), and a person who stops and goes on a loud and angry tirade about how evil the petition is believing the petition is a good idea.  the first is direct.  the second is something else.

she's primarily writing about the trumpian, \"lock her up\" and white nationalist types, whereas you're talking about the social conservative anti abortion types. on the front of the trumpian and white nationalist types, i think she's right, you need to stamp down hard on them, or every election will turn into an abc election that the cpc will lose almost every time. the left generally doesn't like the idea of a social conservative getting in charge, but i think our decade of harper has shown that they're generally willing to tolerate some amount of social conservatism if it comes along with relatively stable policy elsewhere. what will motivate and mobilize the left en masse against the cpc is the fear of racists and white nationalists getting into power. just ask harper what the scary brown person hotline did to his campaign outside of quebec. 

i think gerson is right here, in that the party can still keep appealing to the social conservatives, and the rural hunters and farmers who want to keep their long guns and such, without continuing to drift towards the full blown conspiracy theory and blatantly racist state of the us republican party, and that it's probably not a bad idea to make an example of some people right now to put a bit of a lid on it.",conservatives

&gt;so far, the government plans to increase taxes on stock options granted by companies with annual revenue above $500-million...

&gt;paul gryglewicz, senior partner at global governance advisors inc., outlined one possible response to the upcoming stock option measures, which will increase taxes once an individual has more than $200,000 worth of options vest in a given year. (vesting allows the holder of an option to exercise their right to buy an equity share at a predetermined price.) he says companies could structure grants of options so that they vest at a slower pace and thereby reduce the employee’s exposure to the higher tax rate.

the new measures around the stock option loophole are extraordinarily narrow, and as a result, people will find ways to avoid them and they will raise very little revenue.

unfortunately, this example is representative of the whole tax code. every time you add a rule or exemption, that's an opportunity for avoidance. the incredible success of tax avoidance strategies and the resulting difficulty of actually taxing the wealthy is not a fact of nature, it's actually a result of our own government's fixation on creating complicated tax rules.

wealth taxation, or any attempt to tax the wealthy for that matter, will not work if we continue this ridiculous approach. taxes need to simple and broad, with no special exemptions. this is how you increase both revenue and fairness.

given our proclivity for this kind of tax design, it's no surprise that estimates for the avoidance of a wealth tax are high:

&gt;alexandre laurin, director of research at the c.d. howe institute, says he believes that the 35 percent avoidance rate assumed by the pbo is too low, and that it underestimates the motivation to avoid a recurring wealth tax.

however, this need not be so. in sweden, a 1% wealth tax reduced reported wealth by 0.2% [seim (2017)]. in colombia, a 1% wealth tax reduced reported wealth by 2-3% [londo ̃no-v ́elez and avila (2017)]. in switzerland, where there is no third-party reporting of wealth due to bank secrecy, the wealth tax lowers reported wealth by 23-34% [brulhart et al. (2016)]. the pbo estimate of 35% is a higher avoidance rate than anywhere else in the world, including switzerland, a country practically built on the concept.

it's clearly possible to create a wealth tax that is effective and with low avoidance. yet, if we take the same approach to taxation as we have thus far, the pbo and laurin will surely be proven correct.

despite the headline, this article does not actually suggest an easier path to taxing the wealthy. the fact is that achieving fairer taxation is going to require the hard, slow work of simplifying the tax code and rooting out the exemptions.",liberals

&gt;israel has signed a deal with pfizer to share extensive data on how the vaccine works in israel. **prime minister benjamin netanyahu said he has had 17 conversations with bourla himself**, and that israel expects to vaccinate all citizens over the age of 16 by the end of march.

&gt;**european commission president ursula von der leyen was on the phone to bourla friday** when europe was informed it would also be getting fewer doses over the next four weeks because of the facility upgrades.

specifically the cause of the interruption:

&gt; pfizer issued a public statement today saying that the company is looking to ramp up vaccine production and deliver up to two billion doses over 2021. 

&gt; \"to accomplish this, certain modifications of production processes will be required,\" the company said. \"pfizer is scaling up manufacturing operations in our puurs, belgium manufacturing facility to increase  dose  availability and output and, as a result, there will be a temporary impact on some shipments until mid-february in order to quickly enable increased production volumes afterwards.\"

&gt; the company said it anticipates that the supply disruptions will balance out and that it will be able to keep its delivery schedule for the first quarter of the year. 

that seems ok, short term pain, long term gain.

from federal government pov:

&gt; \"this situation with the pfizer delay is temporary. our vaccination objectives for the first quarter of the year, january to march, are not changing,\" trudeau said from the steps of rideau cottage today.

&gt; \"the total number of doses committed to us is still the same,\" he said...

&gt; ...shipments resume in the last week of january.

&gt; fortin said deliveries are expected to scale up in the first two weeks of february, adding he won't be able to offer more details about pfizer-biontech shipments next month until he is briefed by the company on thursday.

again, short term pain, long term gain.

&gt; anand later addressed a statement put out by pfizer on jan. 15 that said the supply disruptions in europe would be gone, and vaccine delivery would be back to normal in the eu, by the week of jan. 25.

&gt; \"they assured me that canada would be treated equitably. they assured me that pfizer would comply with its contractual commitments of four million doses for q1,\" she told cbc news network's power &amp; politics in an interview that aired earlier this evening.

bottom line:  pfizer will still meet the delivery outlined in the contract.  seems like a tempest in a teapot, or a molehill masquerading as a mountain.",liberals
