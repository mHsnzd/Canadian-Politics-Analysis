this has been done repeatedly.  if you aren't hearing it or seeing it, you really aren't looking for it.

&gt;i don't think the rebate is substantial compared to the col increases.

again, for the vast majority of tax filers, the rebate was equal to or more than was paid in carbon tax.

it probably isn't the most effective approach. i mean, an authoritarian government just mandating and implementing the change that needs to happen is probably far more effective - but that isn't really desirable for the vast majority of democratic countries. instead, the conservatives came up with the \"market-driven approach\" that is the carbon tax - yes, it was initially a conservative plan that was proposed as an alternative to government imposed change.

as to evidence for the efficacy of carbon taxes at reducing consumption, it's a relatively new area of study (as we haven't had carbon taxes for very long), but the current research seems to support that it is effective:

those are my two cents. regardless of what happens on monday, i think the biggest takeaway from the night won't be who won the election; it will be the ppc and their growing base of support, even if they don't win any seats. 

last piece, and this is coming from someone who is not a ppc supporter whatsoever: if support for the ppc pans out, they will have to be included in the national dialogue. the cbc, amongst other media organizations, has made a concerted effort this election not to include them in anything, but i sincerely think that will have to change. ignoring a party that is polling higher than the green's because they are divisive is not justified (how about the bq?).",liberals

the headline is a vague platitude, but the proposed solution (organize and mobilize) is a little more concrete. with that said, it is absolutely not that simple. the filter of supporters&gt;members&gt;donors&gt;organizers gets extremely narrow, especially when you take into account that the ndp's strongest demographic are young people who are generally in school, working multiple jobs, or trying to establish a career.  organizations like the one cited by the author come and go by nature, and it's extremely difficult to sustain. 

i guess this is where the \"no more excuses\" part comes in, but it's very hard to say \"no more excuses, we need ~50 dedicated volunteers in every competitive riding even in non-election years\" and actually have it mean something. and that's to say nothing on getting each wing of the party to agree on a platform with enough enthusiasm to volunteer. i'm pretty die-hard and even i didn't volunteer in the past based on the mulcair platform, and i'll bet you anything someone out there is the exact opposite of me.",liberals

what a lot of this discussion is doing is accepting appointing simon as an inevitability. it wasn't. trudeau could have chosen somebody else, including someone who was indigenous and spoke both official languages, and maybe also an indigenous language. that was *his* choice he made here. 

and there might well be reasons for that, reasons we in the public don't know. were there no other suitable candidates who'd accept the position? it's a bit far fetched to me, but it is *possible*, especially given the confluence of many indigenous people rejecting the idea of an indigenous gg, and the whole payette situation not making rideau hall look supremely appealing at the moment. 

but we have no such explanation from trudeau. instead we're just told (implicitly) that we needed to chose between french capability or indigenous representation, and that francophones need to just take one for the team here. as the commissioner says in the article though, i'm far from convinced that we couldn't have had both.",liberals

and you don’t need to look further to realize the agenda here:

&gt; despite knowing on may 19 that china was breaking its deal with canada, the trudeau government waited until the end of august to enter into vaccine contracts with pfizer, far behind other countries. on july 16, trudeau pretended that the partnership with china was still a go.

that is an outright lie.   canada signed a deal with pfizer early august, announced on august 5 (same day deal with moderna was announced) and was the 4th country to do with, only 2 weeks behind the first country (uk) to sign a apa with pfizer.

edit:  with that said, yes putting all the blame on the loss of connaught industries is a cop out.  but regardless, the issue is our lack of capacity, and even if we did find a way to manufacture a viable candidate (earlier than this upcoming fall), it likely would have had zero effect on our february struggles.  but canada does need to invest more in its domestic manufacturing capacity and not just through crown corporation but by making us more lucrative to private firms.",liberals

grq212h,2021-03-21T04:00:19.000-07:00,"abacus data | 33 lpc, 29 cpc, 19 ndp, 8 grn, 7 blc i live in british columbia, so it's particularly evident here because we have an ndp government and a green opposition. so you can look at all the stuff that the greens have been pushing the government on, and where the ndp has refused to budge.

fossil fuel stuff is the obvious one. the bc ndp has gone all in on fracked gas, which massive expansions of fracking and transport pipelines. likewise, the alberta ndp was a massive proponent of tar sands digging and got into a trade war with bc over trying to build a pipeline. greens want none of that.

the greens here have [been harping on the ndp over old-growth forest](https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/b-c-greens-call-for-halt-on-logging-island-old-growth-1.23821593) logging as well. the green party [actually started because a bunch of old-growth advocates](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/a-look-back-at-the-birth-of-the-b-c-green-party-1.4102628) got bounced out of an ndp convention in the '80s by the ndp's logging-union backers.

first nations reconciliation is another big one. the greens here spend a ton of time trying to get the government to advance reconciliation causes, and they're up against a wall often. the wet'su'weten blockade last year was because the ndp was building a pipeline. the local green leader went up to the blockade to try to mediate. there've been a ton of other examples here. [there was a bill about private power production](https://www.vicnews.com/news/b-c-greens-nix-ndps-change-to-private-power-production/) which would have adversely affected indigenous communities, where the ndp didn't consult properly and the greens took them to task on it. the ndp blamed their early election call on the greens for[ not supporting their bill](https://www.terracestandard.com/news/horgan-blasts-b-c-greens-for-refusing-youth-overdose-detention/) on youth overdose attention, which the greens opposed because of first nation's concerns. the greens[ just managed to get the ndp to pause on a firearms bill](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/vaughn-palmer-green-mla-wins-pause-on-clause-in-firearms-bill) because of how it would affect first nations.

another is that the ndp is extremely authoritarian and centralized compared to the greens. greens trend towards almost left-wing-libertarianism, with power devolved down to the lowest level possible. ndp is the exact opposite. you can see this right now with the court case where the [bc ndp and the ontario conservatives have teamed up to argue together](https://thetyee.ca/news/2021/03/09/david-eby-defends-decision-back-doug-ford/) against cities in their provinces.

anyway, i could go on. it's harder to point out with the federal ndp because they've never been in government and thus don't have a record to defend. but they say a lot of stuff that directly contradicts what their provincial wings actually do when they get into government. so we'd have to see if they walk the walk, or if they'd wind up just mirroring what we've already seen from them provincially.",conservatives

one of the court's \"powers\" is to review the constitutionality of legislation. the court has found time and time again that mandatory minimums breach section 12 of the charter (cruel and unusual punishments) because there are circumstances where the mandatory minimum would be grossly disproportionate for the specific offense committed. examples include a notional college student crossing the border with a single joint, an addicted person obtaining drugs for their addicted spouse, and a gun-owner convicted of a firearms offence due to license expiry.

the legislature and executive have tools in their power. the crown can make an argument that the breach is permissible under section 1 of the charter, or parliament can either bring the legislation within the boundaries of the charter or pass legislation using the notwithstanding clause.

ha95mec,2021-08-24T14:20:55.000-07:00,"liberals will take aim at real-estate speculation, propose homebuyers’ ‘bill of rights’ in ambitious housing policy i think there are interesting takeaways from this, depending on how you want to look at your stats:

* stephen harper made **143** promises in that particular legislative session (41st)
   * he kept 77% of them (110)
   * he partially kept 7% of them (10)
   * he broke 16% of them (23)
* justin trudeau has made **696** promises over two terms (42nd and 43rd)
   * he kept 39% of them (271)
   * he partially kept 14% of them (100)
   * 21% of them are currently being worked on (143)
   * 21% are not yet rated (148)
   * he broke 5% of them (34)

i think something that is sending the percentages a bit out of whack is that it looks like a significant number of promises were made (an extra 343) as part of the last election, but it is clear that not much progress on many of them were done until the last several months, likely due to covid, as that threw a wrench into many governmental agendas. if you were to look at the the 42nd and 43rd sessions only, you would get the following stats:

* 42nd session he made 353 promises
   * he kept 67% of his promises (236)
   * he partially kept 26% of his promises (92)
   * he broke 5% of his promises (25)
* 43rd session he made 343 promises
   * he kept 10% of his promises (34)
   * he partially kept 2% of his promises (8)
   * he has 42% of them in progress (145)
   * he has another 43% of them that were not yet started (147)
   * he broke 3% of them (9)

without getting into the actual quality of the promises that were kept and broken (i.e. electoral reform is something that comes up a lot in this sub, but is still just one promise in these stats) you could have the following takeaways:

* stephen harper made a significantly smaller number of promises. granted trudeau has two terms of promises now, but even compared to trudeau's first term, harper made only 40% the number of promises that trudeau made.
* trudeau kept more promises in his first term, then harper made promises, like at a 1.7x rate.
* harper's combined kept + partially kept value is 84% for the first term. trudeau's kept value is a bit lower on the firs term that harper's (67% to harper's 77%), but the combined kept + partially kept is 93%
* trudeau broke more promises overall - 25 in his first session, 9 in the second for a total of 34 - compared to harper's 25, but due to harper's much lower number of promises overall, harper had a higher broken percentage rate (16% to trudeau's 5%).
* it's when you factor in the last term, which it appears was quite hamstrung by covid, which ballooned out a lot of the promises that were not started or are in progress, compared to overall kept.

stats are fun to look at from a quantitative level, but they probably don't tell the whole story. though i guess the most interesting takeaway i had from this is that if you want to have a high % kept rate, make fewer promises :)",liberals

i'm sorry, but this is an *extremely* naïve understanding of how the negotiations began. trump literally threatened to unilaterally withdraw from nafta (which as president he absolutely could have ordered), and then the mexicans caved and started bilateral negotiations. what would you have done in that situation? pray that the most egotistical, temperamental, and protectionist president in american history was bluffing? that would be *incredibly* stupid. look at the pros and cons: if we negotiate, we at least have a say in any new agreement, and the worst case scenario is that no agreement is reached, nafta is torn up, and our economy gets hit with a 100-kiloton nuke. if we *don't* negotiate, we have *no* say in any potential new agreement, and the worst-case scenario is *still* our economy gets hit with a 100-kiloton nuke.",liberals

or there eventually was a critical mass of evidence that couldn't be ignored. :)

&gt;how is pointing to likely and unlikely origins as reported and speculated on by many scientists not saying \"we don't know\"?

well, when you call it a conspiracy theory (i've already linked to the article calling it that) and not allow people to discuss it (on facebook at least), that...doesn't sound very much like \"i don't know\" to me.

&gt;so i have to ask, why are you making up a false narrative of media bias and cover up where none exists?

i never claimed a \"cover up\". i think the media is in its own echo chamber and isn't educated on the science enough to know what is or isn't settled science. that isn't terribly controversial. i think this article does a good job summarizing the timeline.

&gt;my strong suspicion is that this is true across domains of expertise, and is creating a lot of bubbles of fake consensus that can become very misleading. and i don’t have a solution.

(and by the way, this is literally the co-founder of vox writing that)

gzsrpf7,2021-05-28T06:14:07.000-07:00,"how the tories can gain traction i agree with your suggestions, they would make for a more appealing party. the cpc cannot win by pandering to social conservatives and climate change deniers, the caucus needs to be wiped out of those loons. they also cannot win if they're not offering anything interesting to the electorate so they should work on their policymaking. 

however, they need more than that in order to win. the first order of business should be to disallow non-bilingual candidates for the leadership next time round. and by bilingual, i mean an ability to debate well both in english and french, not o'toole or scheer's cringe french performances. 

otherwise... they're not getting the francophone vote, which is significant in almost a third of the ridings. they're basically ensuring their loss by having no bilingualism standards. as an acadian, if i see that you haven't bothered to get to the standard i would expect of an aspiring prime minister, it smacks of disrespect. anglophones wouldn't accept lousy english, and nor should we with french. 

have the next leader understand regions outside the prairies. at least o'toole is making an effort with québec, which would pay off if his french was better. you need the leader to understand québec and atlantic canada and appeal to ontarians in order to gain power. and we all know that there's no way the cpc would get to govern if it gets a minority in this day and age. to get that majority, the leader needs a good east &amp; west representation.",conservatives

&gt; well, when you call it a conspiracy theory (i've already linked to the article calling it that) and not allow people to discuss it (on facebook at least), that...doesn't sound very much like \"i don't know\" to me.

because the assertion that it was made in a lab or leaked from a lab was a conspiracy theory until there was evidence. but news media consistently said it was a possibility, just one with no, evidence and one which went against the general scientific consensus.

&gt; i never claimed a \"cover up\".

you said the phrase \"trust the science\" was used to silence policy discussions. how is that not a cover up? 

&gt;  i think the media is in its own echo chamber and isn't educated on the science enough to know what is or isn't settled science. that isn't terribly controversial.

wow a blog post that can be summarized as \"media sensationalizes things\". i've literally shown you multiple articles from before the new report from multiple respected papers that laid out the facts completely fairly and admitted that a lab leak was possible but unlikely so i'm not sure what this is supposed to prove anyway. 

&gt; but below are some examples where i think that \"health experts\" or \"science\" has been used to shut down discussion.

since one person commenting something isn't evidence of much of anything, i'm going to ignore the comments that have one or negative upvotes. that leaves us with this one comment that you think is proof of using \"health experts\" or \"science\" to shut down discussion:

\"um no. this disaster is medical. to suggest that politicians know more than doctors about fighting a pandemic is ridiculous.\"

this is an objectively true statement the commenter made by the commenter about whether or not politicians should push back on scientific recommendations. this is also not, as you'll note since you participated in it, the end of the discussion. 

so just to summarize, we started with your claim

&gt;\"trusting science\", the catchphrase that was used to shut down any policy discussion not deemed acceptable.

and the only legitimate evidence you've provided for this is one comment that says politicians don't know more about fighting a pandemic than doctors and then the discussion continues.",liberals

the election is still winnable for the tories, or at minimum we're looking at winning the popular vote again and maybe gaining some additional seats.

it *does* matter.

&gt;i dont' know what you mean by that - harper did very well in quebec for a cpc candidate. 

harper should've seen the gta, montréal, vancouver areas becoming more liberal, inevitably most urban voters quickly switched to liberal once cultural and social issues become forefront rather than economics. this was such a short-sighted notion that focusing on economics will win the suburban voters, but that means conservative social and cultural matters are left in the back burner and the moment we bring them up we lose those suburban voters quickly.

edit: i'm not sure why i'm getting downvoted here, it is fact that the cpc needs those suburban voters to have any chance of winning. harper ran on primarily an economic platform and that won him the suburban voters, but economics isn't the main winning issue these days, social and cultural issues are the forefront.

anyway, like i said, unless the cpc becomes honest that conservatism isn't popular with the urban, younger, largely immigrant, voters, then it's going nowhere. i went to university in toronto, being a conservative there is something you hide. most posters here doesn't seem to be aware of the political landscape of the urban areas, it's *really* difficult to get conservative votes.

i mean i really wonder, do you even live in toronto, or in an urban area? it's not cpc country at all. you don't seem to understand the frustration of conservative voters living in urban areas, we see first hand *why* justin trudeau is in government, the urban voters. it's something i encounter *every single day*, it's liberal/ndp country.",liberals

grbaiy1,2021-03-17T13:04:16.000-07:00,"is it time for ontario to end catholic school funding? here in ontario, we had a very thorough, fully informative, age appropriate, in depth in the mechanics as well as including gender identity and sexual orientation (i believe that for the younger grades like 3-6 they sort of just touched on it briefly, explained what it is but didn't go in depth or make a whole unit on it. went in depth in the older grades). this sex ed had been in the works for more than a decade, literally, lots of time (and likely money) was spent researching and talking to experts in a bunch of fields/topics, going through the most in depth research and up to date research. for more than a decade. it had been implemented 4 or 5 years ago and was generally seen as a huge success and got very positive response from experts and 'critics'.

then, social conservatives made a big fuss saying they weren't being heard or considered enough in the party and debate and that they are more important than anyone else essentially, they made enough of a fuss that it was repealed, and replaced with the cirriculum from the late nineties. i read a couple articles comparing the cirriculums and oh my god the old one was severely lacking - and not just in the sexual orientation and gender orientation topics. it was lacking everywhere else. and of course, only taught abstinence only and conveniently left out so much important things.

edit: did a bit of research again and i was wrong about a thing or two. so the original plan was to go back to the 1998 cirriculum but after backlash, ford created a new cirriculum that did include brief topics about gender identity and sexual orientation, but they weren't even mentioned until grade 8 and grade 6, respectively. the one that took a decade to make had began to mention these things in grade 3. children who are nongender conforming will be thinking about their gender identity long before they are thinking about sexual orientation, yet ford flipped them around, put sexual orientation a year earlier, and gender identity five years later. these topics were really slimmed out though. the other one, again, took a decade to make and consulted with teachers all over the province, had democratic support, had 80% or more of parents saying these topics were 'very important' to teach. provincial school boards and teachers associations all tried to take ford to court and protested, there were classroom walk outs, teacher backlash, yet none of it worked.

**another fucked up thing:** ford made a [snitch line](https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2018/08/22/educators-slam-fords-snitch-line-for-teachers-who-defy-sex-ed-rollback.html) for parents to report teachers who were still teaching the liberal cirriculum, reminiscent of harper's 'barbaric culture' [anti-muslim snitch line](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/10/05/when-stephen-harper-refers-to-barbaric-culture-he-means-islam-an-anti-muslim-alarm-thats-ugly-and-effective-because-it-gets-votes-edward-keenan.html).
