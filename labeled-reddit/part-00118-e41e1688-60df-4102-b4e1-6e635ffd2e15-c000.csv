well that’s more than other writers do at the np so i’ll give you some credit there.

&gt;honestly, i think it could have been as simple as adding additional conditions to the checklist of requirements that people needed to say they conformed to (which would then be verified late, retroactively, as in cerb). 

want to be clear, when you say this you understand that’s it’s probably not this simple, also i’m saying this as someone who generally agrees the rollout was sloppy but considering the alternatives we seen, we better options?

&gt;so, for example, \"i agree that i am living independently, or, if not living independently, that my family's household income is less than $100,000\"). 

i agree with this generally, that they should be able to differentiate if someone is or isn’t dependent on someone making more than 100k. as long as like you said previously that it’s done retroactively.

&gt;then simply use osap's impressive preexisting infrastructure to verify that later.

impressive? going to be honest this makes me question everything you’ve said so far. maybe things have changed drastically but if this was the case i can imagine students sitting in the financial aid office while getting a vaccine to try and release the first set of funding. but maybe that’s just my experience or high standards of expectations.

&gt;with just those two simple conditions, we could have saved incredible sums of money. and, as a reminder, i'm not trying to be misery or callous here – $1.6 billion is a lot of money, and **transferring it regressively to the well-off is a failure in policymaking.**

also to be clear, is the objective here to save money? i am all for, when we are completely out of the pandemic (kinda feels like yet again the np is rushing to get right back into attack mode in case the pandemic ends) any or all reporting and whatever measures need to be taken or addressed.

but i also find fake outrage or partisan points to be low effort in and out of a pandemic. all things considered the 1.6 is a drop in the bucket, regardless of your viewpoints. but if you truly feel the bolded part we have way more bigger issues that lead to this then student aid.",liberals

listen i think it’s crass, ugly and unproductive, and if there were threats of violence that is entirely illegitimate (i just couldn’t find it in the reporting). but i attended several marches last year where similar rhetoric was used towards the cops. same thing was reported out from the protests against eviction clearings. same thing at the blockades, or the anti-ryerson statue protests.

i’ll probably be called conspiratorial for this, and that’s fair enough, but the way this has been framed is extremely useful for a struggling liberal campaign (that can portray themselves as under siege). 

it’s just notable the different ways that similar speech / protest is covered depending on whether the protestors are considered part of the in-group or out-group of the media / political class.",liberals

any agreement for electoral reform will see the cpc set up the referendum in the worst possible way for electoral reforms chances to succeed (for example fptp against several different methods and choosing the winner via fptp). it will be a referendum with a poison pill.

the ndp will lose significant support for having allowed the cpc to govern and won’t achieve their goal of reform either. if the ndp is going to prop up the cpc, here would be my demands:

1) continue with the liberal childcare plan of 10$ a day across canada
2) carbon tax remains untouched by their stupid replacement. they can rename it “otooles carbon credits” or something and pretend it’s different. i don’t care.
3) pharmacare and dental care for all
4) no votes against abortion rights, or the rights of minorities. doing so will immediately result in bringing down the government via a no confidence motions

&gt;they are responsible for the majority of infections running down our medical system though.

ok. that's a different thing. again, if x people are responsible for the majority of y bad thing, it can still be true that the vast majority of x people are not responsible for it.

remember the old \"not all muslims are jihadi terrorists, but all jihadi terrorists are muslims\" thing?

again, are you suggesting that if a segment of the population has higher odds of negatively impacting other people, we should get to systemically discriminate against them? do you know how crazy that sounds?

again, there's a very critical difference between \"the unvaccinated are the majority of hospitalizations\" and \"all unvaccinated people are a threat\". one is a fact, the other is bigoted fear-mongering. there's 192 unvaccinated people in hospital or icu with covid right now. ontario has 13.6 million total people, 11.35 million are fully vaccinated. that means there's roughly 2 million unvaccinated people. closer to 2.3 million. there's 778 covid cases among the unvaccinated. or only around 0.03% of the unvaccinated have covid.

justifying discriminating against a group of 2.3 million people because 0.03% of them have a virus is insanity.

however, there was a sizeable - and vocal - contingent who took this to be some effort to delegitimize or minimize the complaints of people who are still under-served or actively oppressed and that whole article was a bad joke.

people are free to consider the dress as a fundamental part of their faith, as someone would be free to claim that it is part of their religious belief to walk around naked. the fact that their beliefs limit their employment is an issue with the coercive nature of their belief -- that they partake in as a free, thinking human being -- not with the employment requirements. no faith is explicitly singled-out.

&gt;do you people who want restrictions lifted actually, legitimately want \"fuck it, pretend it doesn't exist, and just hope no one in your family are the ones who dies from it\"?

at this point, everyone can choose to get vaccinated if they're worried or particularly at higher risk. period.

we do this with the flu every where. we say \"fuck it, pretend it doesn't exist, and hope nobody i know dies from it\". so don't act like that approach is unheard of - it's how we deal with most viruses.

&gt;genuine question number 2: do you understand what 'flatten the curve' actually meant? do you actually think it was 'this virus will be gone in 2 weeks :)'? because it wasn't. it was \"holy shit, we need to slam the brakes now, if we don't do so within the next two weeks or so, we're going to incapacitate our medical system and things will get even worse\".

yes, i understand.

the issue i have is that it wasn't \"just\" two weeks, and was never going to be \"just\" two weeks. the government lied. because if, in march 2020, the government came out and said \"alright everyone, we're gonna have lockdowns, travel restrictions, gathering limits, mandatory vaccinations, people are gonna lose their job if they don't receive boosters every 6 months, kids won't be allowed in school, and we're gonna have a digital government id that you need to show everywhere you go in public at all times\", everyone would have lost their collective shit. so instead, it was \"well it's just two weeks\". then \"it's just another couple weeks\". then it was \"it's just until we have vaccines\". then it was \"it's just until the vulnerable are vaccinated\". then it was \"it's just until herd immunity\". then it was \"well maybe it's just until we get to 80% vaccinated - no 90% - no everybody\". then it was \"it's just two doses, just take them\". then it's \"well it's just a booster for the new variant - oh btw, you can't leave the country or work your job anymore if you refuse\".

that is my problem.

&gt;the further restrictions we've had absolutely logically follow

i don't think you're actually arguing that the restrictions we've had are logical. 90% of them are not logical.

&gt;i fucking hate whoever decided to not just brand it as \"sars 2\".

you and i both know that if they branded it \"sars2\" everyone wouldn't have been as amenable to the government authoritarianism and 'emergency' measures. giving it a new scary name was obviously intentional.

&gt;that, and i do not at all understand why i'm supposed to give a shit about showing a qr code to go to a restaurant, or getting vaccinations.

the fact that you aren't upset about your rights being eroded doesn't justify the erosion of rights.

remember when people said \"it's just a bus seat, what's the big deal\" or \"it's just a drinking fountain, what's the big deal\".

seriously, let's rewind to the 1940's, what's the big deal if certain people need to use different water fountains than others? why does it actually matter? it's still a water fountain. it's still free drinking water. why does it matter? why are we supposed to be upset about some people not being allowed to use one drinking fountain when there's another perfectly good one right beside it?

i'm not being facetious btw, i'm actually wondering, on a moral and principle level, why you think that something like segregation laws like requiring people drink from different water fountains is a big deal. i mean, it's just a water fountain. objectively speaking, it's not a big deal at all. everyone still gets to drink water.

but morally, and on principle, you know that it's important, right? that the principle of the matter is what's important, not the practical aspect of drinking water from a fountain. the actual act of drinking water from a fountain is inconsequential. the problem is on a moral/principle level. it doesn't matter that it's on a trivial thing.

yeah, showing a piece of id at a restaurant on its face isn't a huge deal, you're right. it's not. you may personally not care, just like i'm sure some people didn't care about drinking fountains. but on a moral level, the government going \"papers please\" just for a canadian citizen to participate in society is wrong on a deep moral and principle level.",liberals

i didn’t say they are undemocratic because i find them inconvenient or unpopular, i (literally) said they are undemocratic because they allow a minority to block the will of the majority.

why is it on so many points that i have to repeat myself two or three times with you, sometimes repeating the exact same words, verbatim? [you and i have already gone several futile rounds on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/nukt4g/liberals_bloc_vote_to_end_bill_c10_study_amid/h0zi2no/?context=3), and here again i continue to find your comments illogical and/or misinformed, so i’m sure you won’t be surprised if this thread ends like that one did.

in any event, even their supporters don’t try to claim that filibustering isn’t obstruction—it simply and undeniably is, and is the entire point of doing it—they just think it’s an appropriate tool to have if and when a minority believes a (democratic) majority is doing the wrong thing. we could have a whole debate on it, but the point here isn’t about the relative merits and demerits of the filibuster. it’s about the author of the article saying that a motion for time allocation—which is *also* part of the long tradition of parliamentary democracy—is “politicizing” while failing to mention the filibustering that made it necessary. that point still stands, serene and undisturbed by you.

&gt;inferences so weak they may as well have been wholly imagined.

i completely disagree.

&gt;what's your primary metric for a medium's market importance if not popularity?

what is “market importance” and what relevance does it have to this discussion? i said “importance,” not “market importance,” and your interest in putting words in my mouth here further indicates a lack of intellectual rigor and/or good faith, both of which suggest a state of diminishing returns for my participation in the discussion.

&gt;it's also about youtube, facebook, et al thanks to the relevant clause having been removed and the minister indicating as much. of course, to the limited degree prescribed by the bill. no kidding. it's about foisting canadian content on viewers who haven't bothered to seek it where it can be found easily: cbc gem and cable. canadians know where to find canadian content, they just don't always choose to watch it in great numbers.

as with many of your statements, this falls into the category of “not even wrong,” in that it makes so little sense that it can’t be straightforwardly debunked because of false premises, non-sequiturs, and the like. for one thing, your second sentence isn’t even logically consistent with itself, because those who “haven’t bothered” to seek something are presumably merely neutral on the subject, and are not opposed to it thereby—they just haven’t bothered—and therefore might actually *welcome* that thing being “foisted” upon them, because then they will have been introduced to something that they have not seen before not because they actively don’t want it, but simply because they haven’t bothered to look for it. naturally, what is “foisted” on them doesn’t have to be *watched* by them. nothing in c-10 proposes a version of the ludovico technique for cancon.

also, cable is also dominated by non-canadian programming, so it’s not necessarily “easily found” there. one of irene berkowitz’s main points was that canadian content is easily found on netflix and youtube, and you seem to be supporting her article, but now you seem to be contradicting her, by suggesting that it isn’t there, but only/primarily on cbc gem and “cable”. and, of course, “they don’t always choose to watch it in great numbers,” is both an unsourced, unsubstantiated statement—a “fabrication”, to use your words—and too vague to respond to, because what does “great numbers” mean?

canada had a *citizens united case* years ago, and the supreme court found in favour of the restrictions - *harper v. canada*. 

the problem for the current law is that there are still relatively easy hurdles that you need to jump to use the *harper v. canada* principles for provincial governments. you need to show that your restrictions are evenly applied, that they are reasonable, that they are minimally intrusive for their goal and that they are rationally connected. 

the current government, intentionally or not, flubbed the argument in court. their own witnesses' evidence was that the time cut off was arbitrary and there was no need to extend the exclusion period. 

since the government's own evidence was that the basic outline for a *harper v. canada* application of s.1 was not met, the judge had no choice but to strike down the law. 

s.33 does not exist to give governments who can't shoot straight and win constitutional arguments with supreme court precedent on their side a mulligan, or to use casually for governments that can't be bothered to put real work and thought into their laws.

the problem is not that this particular law was passed, its that conservatives intend to make ignoring constitutional rights an unremarkable matter of legislative administration - at least according to their partisans in the toronto sun and in queen's park who keep insisting that using s.33 is just one of those normal, common things governments should do to pass laws. 

it's the intention to use this as a first step to making s.33 an expected part of the legislative process that is actually worrying - not the minutia of when unions can run ads.",conservatives

glad we agree. there really isn't much difference. 

&gt;would've been better for who? you and the cpc - absolutely. better for conservatives in this country? no - definitely not

you got it backwards. having a whiney little bitch around and his bitchettes wouldn't particularly be good for the the party and doesn't do me any good at all. but i think it's better for conservatives and the country to have all voices represented and all positions considered, no matter how stupid. and there's still ways to incorporate the ideals if you have a brain (so maybe not you personally but still). look at leslyn lewis - intelligently said she was anti abortion but knew that wasn't the will of the country so she would radically increase funding for adoption options and for supporting pregnant women so that they didn't have to have one. 

that's a good conservative. it's an elegant answer, and it goes a long way to achieve the desired goal without pushing an agenda on a country that doesn't want it. 

but i guess it's easier to run away like children and cry about it - just as it's easier to do that after you insult someone and they insult you back. 

&gt;no

yes - it's exactly what we'll talk about. all the 'victories' of the crybaby party. i know it's the last thing you want to talk about because there won't be any. and honestly like i said those votes are no loss really - the cpc will just have to move to the left far enough to reclaim them in the middle.

if this article is to be believed that's well over half of canadian home  owners.  

now - after the last trudeau spent massive amounts of money during good times we saw intererst rates go to 21 percent. don't believe me? look up interest rates in teh 80's. it didn't stay there long but over the entire 80's it averaged 13.5 percent. the historical average in canada is about 5 percent. 

so trudeau is doing all he can to keep interest rates as low as possible because even a small rise will lead to a massive massive recession. similar to what we saw in the states when the bubble burst there. 

worse - trudeau is going to raise taxes. and inflation is happening no matter what the bank does. which means people will have less after tax spending power already. 

my guess is trudeau intends to take a majority gov't now if he can, push the whole bubble explosion down the road two years just in case its' a minority, and spend moeny on all his friends and line his pockets for another 4 years and when it explodes he'll get voted out with a smile on his face and a fat pension and book/speaking deals in his pocket and leave the mess for the cpc to try to clean up. after a term or two of the cpc being the 'bad guys' the libs will look to come back under freeland.",liberals

it's not really an odd tangent to be relating cuban domestic issues with their economy to the direct and very harmful embargo they're currently facing by the us. the us currently has the embargo set up in such a way that anyone doing business in or with cuba is completely banned from doing any commercial activities with or in the us. the cause of this has been that cuba has found it rather difficult for many many years to get access to affordable goods, including food and medicine, which have been the focus of protests in the last few weeks.

obviously it is a problem that the cuban government should feel the need to use force, and i don't approve of the use of force by the cuban government. i do, however, understand why they would use force, and why they would be so immediate with crackdowns given the history of these kinds of events. the idea that \"the us can provide freedom and liberty to cuban people\" is an attractive story that has a lot of potency, especially given the troubles cuba is going through (which again, is at the hands of the us). but it is ultimately a lie - the us has never delivered on the promise of freedom and liberty in other countries, and does not even guarantee those rights to its own people at home.

it is the potency and persistence of the us in trying to undermine countries and subjugate their populations to work in the interest of american business that causes the cuban government to react in the way it does. i guarantee you, if the us lifted its embargo and allowed cuba to just exist on its own terms life would be a lot better on the island, but doing so would require an admission from the us that perhaps american-style capitalism isn't the be-all end-all that it advertises itself to be.",liberals

going forward, nasa just isn't going to be able to fund or initiate the breadth of projects required, or to retain the capital, plant, or brain-trust/intellectual talent required to drive those numbers of projects, or the aerospace industry generally.

example: the true reusable orbiter/delivery vehicle is a product of private industry, not nasa. the latter continued to use a lightly built platform (the shuttle) that was never meant for that purpose (essentially rebuilding them before each next mission), until they finally wore out (or catastrophically failed ..). there was no evolution of the platform (essentially due to budget restrictions) and when they lost that platform they had to contract with others to get to the iss, while private industry worked on a solution. none of this is supportive of the idea that a government *monopoly* in this industry is either a good thing or an improvement on the current situation.",liberals

i am the most lefty, green person i know - but i'm also realistic.

we need to get off of fossil fuels.  that is not arguable.  we should have been off them already, honestly, except for a handful of industries where they are unavoidable.  (long haul freight and space flight, basically.)

in the past 100 years, we haven't found a source of energy with a lower carbon footprint per kilowatt produced than nuclear power.  barring a dramatic breakthrough, we won't.  (cold fusion appears to be a pipe dream.)

unless you're willing to give up 90%+ of modern life, we need to maintain or increase our energy generation, while simultaneously reducing our carbon output and heat production.

two of the largest sources of both are trans-oceanic/cross continent shipping of food, and fossil fuel production of electricity.

part of the solution of the food issue is massive local growth of food.  hydroponic growth or greenhouses will be necessary for the bulk of the planet, because a lot of foods can't readily be grown outside of a limited climate.  gmos are better adapted (and more adaptable) to indoor growth than naturally occurring crops.

lab grown meat seems to be another part of the puzzle for reducing the footprint that feeding over 7 billion humans produces.

both of those are heavily energy reliant though.  which brings us back to the need to remove fossil fuels from our energy equation.

that leaves us with hydroelectric, nuclear, wind, and solar.  of these, only hydro-electric and nuclear are suitable for base load requirements.  hydroelectric is amazing, if you have a waterfall or large river.  if you don't?  we come back to nuclear power.

if a political party is opposed to nuclear power, or gmo crops, their policy is being made by fools.  they may be well meaning fools, but that doesn't change that there is no future of the human race as a technological society that isn't heavily reliant on both nuclear power and gmo crops.  if a group can't admit that, they're not grown up enough to be setting policy on those subjects.",liberals

the united states has played an integral part in cuba's history, it's sort of difficult to talk about cuban state of affairs when the influence of the us is still a very large and looming presence. it's like saying \"vietnamese children suffer from birth defects because of america's use of agent orange during the vietnam war\", and then accusing the person demanding an explanation of \"redirecting attention towards an entirely different country\". when the us spends as much time as it does meddling in international affairs, a lot of issues will inevitably come back to the us.

&gt;by saying you \"understand why they would use force\", it does diminish the severity. i \"understand\" why kim jong il brutally tortures and kills his political opponents. hell, it's totally understandable. same thing with the lack of freedom of speech. i'd propose that almost all human rights abuses are \"understandable\".

this is a false equivalency though. you wouldn't treat a person defending themselves with force and the person attacking them with force the same way. one method of force is defensive, while the other is offensive. there is a historical and theoretical narrative that explains a great deal of why cuba is currently using force against protests, and - again - it is precisely because those protests are ultimately serving the interests of americans over cubans. furthermore, as cuba has observed what happens when communist movements are attacked by the us and those communist movements do not defend themselves, they have learned that when dealing with the us that you must respond to violence with violence, because america will never come with a banner of peace.

i mentioned somewhere else in the comments that che himself was present in guatemala when the us government was complicit in crushing left wing movements in that country, that wanted little more than better working conditions and higher wages in cities and in farms. communists in that country didn't take up arms against the us or the us-backed forces in guatemala, and they were ultimately killed in the hundreds, merely for asking for a raise.

that is why i understand their aggressive opposition to the us. they have seen what happens to communists in latin america who only want better for themselves and their families, and they have seen what the united states in particular does to them.

&gt;you'd support the country turning into an actual democracy, i assume?

what do you mean by \"actual democracy\"? do you mean the current system that we have, whereby a party can win a majority in parliament with a minority of votes? or the system in the united states, where congresspeople, senators and white house officials can be bought out by private interests? or maybe you're talking about the system like they have in the eu, where decisions are made behind closed doors away from the public in brussels to determine who gets to be president of the european commission?

cubans have the right to vote in elections and they do vote in elections. in 2019 they even engaged in a national project to reform and update their country's constitution, which included several updates to human rights measures. when was the last time you got to take part in rewriting your country's constitution?",liberals
