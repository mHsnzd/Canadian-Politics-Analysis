us system is wack though. there the feds and provinces make claim to jurisdiction over all the same things. where as in canada we have things more clearly laid out. eg. health care and education is provincial and jurisdiction and criminal law is federal jurisdiction. so in canada we have both more and less autonomie, whole province doesn't have it's own autonomy in criminal law it has far greater autonomy over education than a state in the us does.

as much as i'd be happy to see canada as a parliamentary republic  for all practical purposes it'd make zero difference as the crown acts impartial and is not involved in our politics.

of course reform could mean electing the govern general and seeing a relationship between the governor general and prime minister develop akin to that of the german president and chancellor or that of icelandic prime minster and president.

quebec is very insistant it's a french province, but often in the private and public sector i wind up served in english, even if i start in my french, which i understand is a bit thick but perfectly understandable. debates were held bilingually for both the montreal (makes sense) and quebec (???) elections. meanwhile, the premier of new brunswick can't be bothered to learn the french language. in some places downtown you can't even get served in french anymore, meanwhile everyone offers to serve me in english, even in the french suburbs.

there's a very protective and in some ways xenophobic sentiment here which is very intimidating or off putting to some, but there's definately way more bilingualism, and willingness to be bilingual, on one half of the divide than the other. i don't really think it's (present) colonialism as much as just the gravitational pull of globalization. the anglicization of the world is now a global phenomenon, and countries around the world are dealing with it in different ways.",liberals

you can already see some of the reactionaries being disobedient or uncooperative due to the ways he's tried to push the party. but he can't do it alone. if he loses his leadership he can hardly do it at all.

so its with my view that any conservatives that align with o'toole to start supporting more reasonable candidates to also help drive that change.

but that's not what we're talking about. everyone would be expected to face those questions.

let's build a hypothetical. it's got two realities - one where derek sloan is the leader of the cpc, and another where leslyn lewis is the leader of the cpc. in all other respects, the realities we're using are functionally identical. neither of these two are heavily experienced politicians, but both have had relative success in their own industries prior to politics - at least enough to have some respect in their communities. 

what i am saying to you is that lewis and sloan could provide the exact same advice to the exact same group of people and no matter how confidently it was delivered, lewis would face greater scrutiny at every step, and at every fork in the road. because she's a woman, and because she's black. it has nothing to do with the quality of the proposals, or how they are delivered, and everything to do with who is doing the delivering. 
further, you would expect this doubly when they are a new leader coming in after a long-serving one. this is why scheer was picked after harper - they were attempting to make as few substantive changes as possible so that they could lessen this part, and him being a white man helped with the earlier part.

this is not some mysterious new concept. it's not a left-wing or right-wing thing, it's not a progressive or conservative thing. it's a problem all of our political parties have, and the vast majority of our businesses have. it is a cultural problem that we, as a society, are making steps to overcome (clay-footed though we're being). 

i don't care for paul. i don't find her to be a convincing speaker, i don't think her policy framework is the way the greens should be looking. i'm not coming to her defence. i'm just saying that this has very little to do with paul herself and much more to do with how people are reacting to her as a black woman, and also as a new leader of a party that has essentially been the may party for a decade or more.",conservatives

[538 - republicans are on track to take back the house in 2022](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-2020-gains-in-the-house-set-them-up-well-for-2022/)

&gt; 2020 was not supposed to be a good year for house republicans. the polls pointed to a democratic-leaning electoral environment, democratic candidates were outraising republicans in most competitive seats, and the gop had to defend a host of open seats that republican incumbents had abandoned.

&gt; **yet, contrary to expectations, including their own, republicans managed to gain seats even as the democrats held onto their majority**. votes are still being counted, but based on contests projected by abc news, **republicans have netted six seats so far, and they may still flip a few more**.

[npr - the 2020 election was a good one for republicans not named trump](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/11/933435840/the-2020-election-was-a-good-one-for-republicans-not-named-trump)

&gt; **republicans outperformed the polls up and down the ballot in the 2020 election**, to the surprise even of many republican political operatives and survey researchers.

&gt; but republicans made gains in the house — so far netting five seats (with 22 races not yet called). given their presumed strength in the suburbs, democrats had been expected to expand their majority.

i think there's room for conservatives to reframe the discussion of one of hope and faith in the capacity for improvement versus despair and distrust in canada as irreparably broken - a contest between stepping up and giving up. 

regardless of the connection to reality, the rhetoric is compelling and is a good way to try to brand themselves. 

i don't support o'toole or the conservative party, but i have to acknowledge strong and compelling messaging when i see it. 

also, the messaging can actually matter. if canada's past has made its celebration impossible, what future is there for the country? is it even possible to see canada as a platform for the positive and constructive development of a free and democratic society? if we cannot be optimistic and positive about the project of canada, how do we expect to get people to \"buy in\" to the kind of socials solidarity we need to keep such a country together and develop stronger social programs that are the real expression of that social solidarity?

\"canada is a great nation with many strengths. no other country has so successfully embraced a mariad of peoples and cultures. i believe this should be celebrated and canada day recognizes all the successes and achievements this nation has born as we come together.

at the same time, there are individuals that feel celebrating canada day should be stopped. they bring up the darkest periods of this country's history including genocide of first nations, historical racial injustice towards ethnic groups ranging from the irish to japanese and more recent hatred towards canadians of middle eastern descent. these concerns are not invalid and while praising our successes it is entirely appropriate to recognize where the nation has failed and what we can do to make these failures right.

i still support the celebration of canada day, however these celebrations should always be tempered by the understanding and discussion of these darkest moments in our history. recognizing this duality in our country is a step towards making it a stronger and better country for all canadians, both past and future'

nadon was deemed to be ineligible for appointment because he did not meet constitutionally necessary requirements to hold a quebec seat, which is that he come from the quebec bar to ensure necessary expertise on the top court in quebec's civil law system. this requirement could not be voided by legislative amendment. 

however, when the governor in council decides to appoint a justice to the supreme court who is bilingual, in keeping with this law, that justice will not by virtue of being selected according to that law be unqualified to sit on the court for constitutional reasons. 

there are ways this can be worded to ensure full constitutionality, making it a guideline that, with a wink and a nod, becomes a de facto requirement, serving as fair notice to those interested in appointment that bilingualism is a must for serious consideration.

your very opinion is, in a way, justifying some of the very feelings many sovereignists/nationalists have. you'd rather do away with the bloc than try to solve the issue at hand, and that is that a sizable number of quebeckers believe they are better off voting for a regional interest or sovereignist party. that they'd rather have them represent them in ottawa than one of the other parties.

&gt; \"other provinces know this will be the inevitable next step,\" he said.

&gt; starting today, close contacts of covid-19 cases will no longer be mandated to quarantine, but isolation will still be required for positive cases and people with symptoms.

hdr59kw,2021-09-21T05:15:18.000-07:00,"election 2021: post-game discussion okay but look at where layton started and look at the popular votes as well. layton had 19 seats and was coming up from bottom. singh’s first campaign they were effectively hitting bottom. 

also it will be 26 by the time things are done.

however look at popular vote counts:

layton’s first two elections: 15.68, 17.45

jagmeet: 15.98, 17.7* (pending mail ins). 

remarkable similar.

in fact despite votes being down for every party if mail ins arrive as expected the ndp should have grown support despite the turnout being 8% lower. they’ll be the only party to do this.

don’t get me wrong. i actually dislike singh as a leader as he is fairly weak in the east and quebec. however, he is also tackling an issue the ndp has which is vote efficiency and may be beginning to build a strong foundation in the west. vote efficiency is not something that can be fixed overnight.

as long as he is consistently making inroads in the west and growing that vote share - especially with the money he’s able to raise - i think it’s premature to take he knives out. yes, we want more seats, but we also want the progressive agenda above all and he can push for that effectively in a minority parliament.

also, for most of layton’s leadership, the liberals were in utter shambles. and that really wasn’t because of layton. it makes sense he would pick up some seats. the liberals of today are an extremely efficient political juggernaut and until trudeau’s popularity collapse will continue to be. imo jagmeet is the right leader in the meantime to secure a new foundation of support in the west. 

what i really want is the ndp to be in a position to become the government when the liberals eventually falter. to do that they need to build trust with canadians and build a strong base of support. i really think jagmeet is on the path to doing that in the west, and while i disagree with his leadership on a lot would be sad to see him go.",liberals

- combine every riding into 2 that elects 2 mps

- parties nominate 2 candidates per riding with a first and second priority

- election happens as normal from the voters perspective. go and check on box for the party you support. only difference is there are two names each

- whatever party gets the most votes wins the riding just like fptp and their first candidate is elected

here’s where it gets complicated:

- divide the number of votes the winning party got by two, eliminate any candidates that didn’t get at least 5% of the vote and all the second candidates of the non winning parties.

- the second seat can only be won by either the second candidate of the winning party, the first candidates of the non winning parties or by an independent

- now look at the popular vote for the country and calculate how many seats each party should get based on that

- subtract the number number of seats each party won on the first candidate by the number of seats they should get nationally

- allocate the second seat in each riding to balance out the seat count proportionally based on their popularity in each riding (which will often be the first priority candidate from the second placed party but not necessarily)

&gt;claims of this nature about the actions of a canadian company operating internationally are not unique. human rights advocates say there are a number of communities, including indigenous groups, around the world that allege they are suffering similar abuses linked to canadian companies from sectors that include the mining and garment industries

&gt;but allegations of this nature rarely get formally investigated in canada.

implied? i'd say you're seeing what legault and blanchet want you to see. i's illogical since the strongest resistance to quebec's racist laws is coming from within quebec from quebec's minority communities. they are the ones doing the tough slogging taking the governemnt to court. so this interprestation is patent nonsense. i could just as easily say that implied in this  nationalist interpretation is the demagoguery and rhetoric  that people like myself are not  \"real\" quebecois because we don;t stand behing legault, the bloc,and the white, catholic francophone  on this issue.

let's take what people say at face value. in this day and age, when you say america, canada, or quebec is racist, you are refering to systemic racism imbedded in the state and society as a whole. in other words, the racism that matters is societal, not personal. i for example couldn't care less if some nobody in a beer-league hockey game calls me a  \"bloke\" when i rap him across the shin pads, because i know anglophones in principle have a priveledged place in canada. it really just hurts my feelings, and i'm a big boy now, and can move to b.c. if i can;t handle it.  i do care about the bias the quebec governemnt has against hiring minorities. that hits me in the pocket book and limits my opportunities in quebec and canada as a whole, and it's bad for quebec and canada to set up silos of priveledge. at the same time, that limitation pales beside the limitations put on aboringals and muslim women by quebec law and scoiety.  there's racism that matters, racism that matters less,  and racism that doesn't. the systemic racism in the rcmp and sq  matters, and legault and the bq need to stop obstructing on this issue just because it hurts their self image to admit that thier  politics is hindering the fight agaisnt racial discrimination in quebec and canada.

\\&gt; the bloc exists because people worry that english canada will go back to ignoring their cultural differences and telling quebec what's good for them.

white francophone catholics  have a priveledged place in quebec and canada. the charter of rights and the founding principles of federalism guarantee that francophones will always  have that priveledged place. the fact that white francophone catholics  are guarding that position too narrowly is problematic, and what is now being adressed in quebec and canada. the bloc is more about defending the priveledge of french canadians than the rights of all quebecers.",liberals

ultimately, the flag at half mast doesn't deal with the indigenous issues like clean water etc.

last time i posted that bodies at schools have been known a long time i was down voted to oblivion, presumably by people thinking i was trying to diminish or dilute the recently discovered one in bc.  just the opposite, i am trying to say this was systemic, and the current government pretending to care with half-masts is a distraction and not a substitute to actually doing something useful.

cpc: 
- gun reform/reclassification

- nix childcare for heavily underfunded tax credit
- increase workers benefit for those making 24k or less
- rework carbon pricing (somehow omit consumers, is a weak plan), reduce climate target to only -30% by 2030 so they can say they hit it (lower the bar to step over it).
- up health transfers to provinces but don’t send the 25b trudeau will (and only up health transfers in 2026.... if elected again)
- build 1 million homes (including the ~500k normally built), ban foreign buyers 2 years
- honestly not sure what else as these were the big things i saw


lpc:
we’re gonna do what we were gonna do
-  childcare at 10$
- funding for vaccine mandates
- work with municipalities to ban handguns
- ban foreign buyers 2 years, build repair or renovate 1.4m homes, tax credit to make second unit, make blind bidding illegal, carrot and stick to municipalities to combat nymbyism. rent to own program.
- climate change: increasing targets, continuing to scale up carbon tax. best reviews by economists and climate scientists on this file.
- 10 new protected marine zones and national parks
- honestly not sure what else as these were my big things 

ndp:
- keep childcare
- pharmacare for all
- increased tax revenue from ultra rich to pay for it
- 500k public housing units by end of term. 20% tax on foreign buyers
- electoral reform
- big climate targets, not great detail
- publicize all long term care homes to prevent catastrophes like in ontario
- light on details. seems to have most revenue neutral plan when taking into account new possible revenues.

bloc:
- vive la quebec/ provincial jurisdiction

2. the provincial parties are not necessarily the same as the federal parties. this is emphasized by tim houston, the newly elected premier-designate of nova scotia, who is a lot more progressive than conservative party and really emphasized that point on his election.
this point is typically true for atlantic provinces.

3. the things that are taken care by federal and provincial can be very different and people may prefer a different party for provincial matter vs federal.

4. only 2% of canadians are members of political party, which means that most people are swing voters that can vote for different political leaning from one election to the next. this is different with us where 2/3 of the population are members of political party and thus much more ingrained in their voting habit.",conservatives

the current government going first is the convention (potentially a binding one, but not one written down in a law). the party with the most seats doing so is something i would describe as a tradition at most, as there's nothing at all binding about it - it is the previous pm that *chooses* not to attempt to continue in government and resigns from their post. and i'd argue it's less \"this is the tradition\" and more \"it's rare for there to be a realistic possibility of the second place party holding the confidence of the house\". although i suppose part of why it's rare is that third parties are likely to view it as right and proper that the first place party form government instead by virtue of their being the first place party.

&gt; provincial precedents include ontario, 1985 and bc, 2017 - though in both cases it resulted in a transfer of power from one party to another. 

well, bc isn't a precedent for a government continuing despite not having the most seats. the liberals won the most seats, but still failed to hold the confidence of the house. 

the other provincial precedent is new brunswick in 2018. the governing liberals wound up with one seat less than the pcs after the election, but gallant continued as premier until he was defeated on the throne speech.",liberals

&gt;it is on record by pmo confirming that and trudeau himself in question period and even on friday.

fta:

&gt;while trudeau and the prime minister’s office previously said they knew nothing of any allegations against vance prior to the exclusive global news report on feb. 2, a new report from the globe and mail cited sources who said sajjan’s chief of staff in 2018 told a senior trudeau advisor about concerns.

[this](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-pmo-senior-adviser-alerted-sajjan-was-troubled-about-information-on/) is the article they refer to. the first two paragraphs:

&gt;defence minister harjit sajjan’s top staffer told a senior adviser inside the prime minister’s office **three years ago** that the minister was troubled by information about former chief of defence staff jonathan vance, shortly after the minister met with a military watchdog.

&gt;mr. sajjan’s then-chief of staff, zita astravas, spoke to elder marques, a senior adviser to prime minister justin trudeau, about concerns related to the country’s top military adviser, two sources told the globe and mail.

emphasis mine. clearly they did know, ignored it, and then tried to lie about knowing. which just makes things worse. at least take responsibility for it instead of trying to hide it. 

your whataboutism to harper is not relevant. i don't care that harper was worse. he has not been prime minister since 2015 and is no longer even in politics. it's long past time to move on and judge this current government on their own merits and not in comparison to others.",liberals

no, i'm not saying one single algorithm can deliver socialism, that's a silly techno-utopian view i don't subscribe to.  what i am saying is that thanks to advances in robotics and data analysis, we have the capacity to allocate resources much more efficiently.  you combine these technological advances with a scaling up of already existing public institutions, and you can begin to see the makings of an economic system that is largely publicly owned, democratic, efficient, and creates post-scarcity while avoiding the inefficiency of say the soviet union, which didn't have access to reliable data or informatics in the same way that we do.  

there's simply no compelling reason why the allocation of resources needs to be decided by private capital by way of the stock market or privately held banking.  not saying all private banks need to disappear, personally i would like to see a scaling up of public investment banks.  private capital holders aren't part of some gnostic sect that has special knowledge that a public body can't ever access; in fact, the opposite - just look at the very solid returns of public pension funds like cpp. 

other than wasting time with pedantry, i have seen not one coherent argument from you why the system we have right now is the single best way of distributing resources or why the private sector can inherently do it better than public institutions.  maybe in the soviet union, that would be the case, but not today.

that is for sajjan to handle.

hard to know.

for one thing, a departmental issue is one only handled by pco and sajjan.

the discussions probably happened between pco and dnd and pmo probably because they were just general discussions and to provide communication.

they will lay out the timeline, what pco did, pmo did and dnd did.

they will say they continually pressed for walbourne to give confidential information, and sajjan and his office continually tried to press the ombudsman.

the last known date based on records appears to be mar. 16th, 2018, so there could be more dates but again sajjan and his office dispute they did nothing. sajjan and his office also say that he did have more meetings with walbourne. walbourne misled on some points saying sajjan could have done his job. he also said there were no meetings. he said sajjan was not shocked. his office says he was concerned.

so many areas of dispute.

those that watched this week's mp interview with mps from the three big parties will notice that mccrimmon said there were many alternatives like the sexual misconduct centre and even prov. not sure what that is but she said the ombudsman could have referred the complainant to that area, and the minister pushed back not because of not caring but because he wanted it to remain confidential. so many areas of dispute. she also said the issue was not actionable meaning that the ombudsman didn't give the sufficient information and the minister wanted to keep the whole process independent and free from political interference.

&gt; curious what your thoughts are on [handgun violence].

okay, here's some random thoughts.

as i understand it, most guns used by criminals are handguns, not rifles.

if you're a criminal who associates with other criminals, you can't resolve disputes by going to the police and the courts, as the rest of us do. so disputes are resolved through violence, and you get the hobbesian logic of an arms race: if your rivals and adversaries have guns, you also need a gun.

where can you get a handgun?

  - if you have a clean record, you can get an rpal yourself. (seems unlikely.)
  - you can offer quick money to someone who's got a clean record to do a straw purchase for you.
  - you can steal one from a legit owner who fails to observe all the required precautions.
  - you can buy a gun in the us (maybe through a straw purchase) and smuggle it over the border. i expect it'd be easier to smuggle handguns than rifles.
  - you can buy a gun from a black-market supplier who's used any of the above methods.
  - maybe you could corrupt a legit supplier to report some guns lost or stolen.

switching perspectives from the criminal back to law enforcement: you want to make it harder for criminals to obtain handguns.

  - because legally owned guns may end up being stolen or purchased by criminals, you want to monitor and limit the number of guns legally purchased, both by an individual and across the country. there was one straw buyer in edmonton who bought 39 handguns.

  - you want to put any large-scale gun smuggling operations out of business.

  - you want to monitor the black market in guns, and put any large-scale dealers out of business. it's like car sales - some people buy from dealers, some people buy direct from the previous owner. the dealers are going to be more visible.

  - is it helpful for individual municipalities (like toronto or vancouver) to ban handguns outright? not sure. i suppose the benefit is that if you see someone with a handgun (say you're at a party or on social media and they're showing off), you instantly know that it's illegal, making it more likely they'll be reported and arrested. criminals are often young and have poor impulse control, so i suspect this would happen quite a lot.

i followed committee meetings and reporting. i read witness testimony. i cross-referenced dates and documents provided to the public to try to understand what had happened. based on that information i believed that there was undue pressure on the civil service from cabinet (potentially via staffers) to select we charity for this program. i believed that this decision was made entirely because of the connections between we charity and trudeau/morneau and the impact that relationship had their negotiations with other members of cabinet like chagger.

realistically let's look at the possibility of cutting tax and how the cpc might address it. first we need to see what trudeau has done.

he got rid of uccb, and added ccb which put 100-700% more money in families pockets.

he lowered oas eligibility to 65 helping seniors.

he adjusted middle class tax brackets, allowing for people to take home more money.

he's instituting a $10 government daycare subsidies. that could be $1000s in saving for some families. or allowing some families to send a parent to work again.

he handed out billions to people impacted by covid through cerb, and now crb.

he's given tax breaks for people working at home. 

his tax increases.

he put in carbon tax, but also gives a sizable rebate to go along with it.

he went after holding companies and high income earners by removing income splitting, and adding passive income caps to holdcos.

so where is the cpc going to cut taxes for help out avg. canadians? they have to go to the wealthy, supply side tax breaks. this will be a nightmare as they will have to remove some of what trudeau is handing out. 

trudeau has literally backed the cpc in a corner. the only thing they can do from a tax stand point is look bad. so now the cpc has to wait for trudeau to fuck up, or leave office. not a great spot to be in. 

the cpc has to start offering suggestions and advocating for good programs instead of trudeau bad stuff.",liberals

grlw1st,2021-03-20T03:29:54.000-07:00,"conservative delegates reject adding 'climate change is real' to the policy book remember when harper bared scientists on government pay roll from using the term global warming and instead wanted them to use the term climate change. now they can't even agree that climate change (without the man made prefix amazingly) exists. who says we aren't moving further to the right? oh well conservatives were not going to get quebec anyway, now they have to sweep ontario and get half the maritimes during an economic downturn to win. good luck with that, especially when carbon taxes actually net the poorest among us money cuz they pay less ( take buses) and receive the same payout. work from home is going to make carbon taxes more popular among higher earners too as it will be a net gain for them as well.",conservatives

well that largely has to do with the fact that it is just felt here way, way than likely the majority of the rest of the country. here in pei for example we are loosing on average a goddamned foot of shoreline **every year**.  that's not to mention the increase in hurricane and other inclement weather. when it's as in-your-face as it is here, it's kind of hard to ignore.",conservatives
grlwu1u,2021-03-20T03:36:36.000-07:00,"conservatives, while still obsessed with cutting taxes and balancing budgets, must put a price on carbon even with baorder agreements. that's is 12.5% the government can tax.. if they decide to also tax air travel, trucks and trains &amp; shipping that's 25%.. currently they get cheaper fuel than us...  what about the rest?

grlx4lm,2021-03-20T03:39:06.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention it's just conservation of energy.

a warm object radiates thermal energy into space, like what you feel if you hold your hand over a hot stove. and a warmer object radiates more energy. so the sun warms the earth until the earth is warm enough that incoming solar energy = outgoing thermal energy.

by digging up and burning fossil fuels, we're rapidly raising the level of co2 in the atmosphere. co2 blocks thermal energy. therefore we've reduced the rate of outgoing thermal energy. the rate of incoming solar energy is the same - we can measure it and see that it hasn't changed in recent decades - and so input &gt; output.
