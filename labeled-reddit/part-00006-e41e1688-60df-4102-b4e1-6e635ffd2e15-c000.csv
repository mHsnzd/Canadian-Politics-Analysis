i mean none of our governments have done well. but since this is about the liberal platform.

since 2016 our emissions have gone up by 23mt or 3.2%.

by 2030 we need to reduce them by 40% now or to 443mt. aka \\~29mt a year or \\~4% a year.

good luck. we aren't even trending in the right direction and here we have our leader trying to outdo targets he can't even accomplish, probably just to claim they have the best plan before the elections.

can't wait to see the ndp target at probably 50% reduction and green party target at 80% reduction by 2030. if it was based on who can promise the biggest reduction we would be net-zero by 2025.

people will just eat this up and will have a \\*shockedpikachu face\\* when we don't hit the targets.

edit: since 29mt reduction a year doesn't mean much to anyone. to put it into perspective. the entire oilsands produce 70mt of ghg a year. so even if we shut down the entire oil sands tomorrow we will achieve less than 2.5 years worth of ghg reductions.",liberals

shorten the work week

national youth employment fund for municipalities

national job retraining fund

none of the points you have made are unreasonable. as i have continued to say throughout this, mistakes are inevitable. but the mistakes made in ottawa have been obfuscated and confused intentionally. i agree that trudeau has seen blame but it is not his fair share in my opinion. 

&gt;	tbh with 33,000 flights per day around the world at the time of vaccine shutdown announcements, it was already well too late to close the border and expect a magical solution where our care home residents - 80% of our covid victims - would all be safe.

is the borders being closed now helping our case and variant numbers right now or not? if yes, would it have led to fewer cases  had it been closed earlier? yes, right?

&gt;	on that note, we could have taken better care of these residents, but failed. perhaps they realistically weren’t saveable, regardless of covid.

agreed. provinces wear this one. 

&gt;	data out of china has been suppressed because cold war v2.0. definitely saying anything about china that isn’t modern mcarthyism these days is either erased or heavily downvoted.

it is a direct quote from minister hajdu that people questioning chinese data were conspiracy theorists. something she doubled down on after being called out for it. https://globalnews.ca/video/6944215/coronavirus-outbreak-hajdu-stands-by-statement-likening-questioning-chinese-covid-19-data-to-pushing-conspiracy-theories

that is one that shouldn’t be up for debate. this was a major screw up. 60 minutes had a piece on it potentially being a bio weapon last week. it’s not a conspiracy theory at all. 

&gt;	australia and new zealand are island states. we aren’t.

yes. border measures would be far less effective here because of that....but by that logic so to are the lockdowns less effective. nz could lockdown effectively knowing that they were sealed tight and it would be worthwhile going forward. we are locking down the interior while maintaining a porous border. around and around the circle we go.

i will say that i am more comfortable with a lockdown now than i was in the fall. lockdowns push cases and fatalities into the future. in the fall that meant pushing them into the spring. today that means pushing them into a future with more vaccinations and more immunity which is finally a trade off that makes sense!



&gt;	both ford and trudeau have been receiving blame for failures as that’s their job. i hope you actually know that.

gsz27pp,2021-03-31T09:55:31.000-07:00,"editorial: carbon tax not as popular as liberals think &gt;lots of mention of various initiatives and tax breaks. where's the funding for all that coming from?

well there's no \"funding' for a tax break. but as for the rest it depends on the program and the province to a degree. most of those would be largely funded by industry or actual marketable need. people need power, they're going to pay for it anyway. forestry companies will put a lot of money into tree replacement. nuclear power would be the big up front costs that would require heavy funding, but in the long run it makes it a million times easier for our companies to sell their new reactors around the world if it's already up and running in  a major way somewhere. 

&gt;the whole point of a carbon tax is to use price signals in lieu of substantial government spending.

well that's not true. first off it's a tax. second - as mentioned between 10 -20 percent of it will be chewed up in administration. we're talking billions of dollars there - this tax when fully implemented will cost many tens of billions of dollars to canadian residents and business. and third off - the gst is not refunded. 

so it's more of a tax grab than zero spending. 

&gt;and how are you going to promote compliance?

pretty simple - did you buy an ev? show me the car. did you plant trees? count the trees. are you thinking they won't be inspecting the nuclear facilities or something? 

&gt;the liberals have a $5k tax credit for evs, for example, and yet uptake, while higher than they expected, is still not even double digit marketshare. 

well that's not 'compliance'. that's something else. but that's largely because of poor 'marketing' and infrastructure (and also a lack of ev's, they go off the lots as soon as they hit the lots). 

it's not hard - you just have to give a shit about it actually working. the libs don't. they only care about tax revenues and virtue signalling. 

&gt;this is what i mean when i say credible. 

it is one hundred percent credible. and given that the liberals have yet to reduce carbon emissions by a tiny fraction despite promising to do exactly that going all the way back to kyoto - if you're trying to claim that they are credible, i'm afraid you've lost your own credibility. 

&gt;the argument for carbon pricing has a nobel prize and several jurisdictions where they have worked,

no - it does not. those are lies that those who like carbon pricing tell people like you, and because you don't do your homework you believe it. 

tell me - which \"nobel prize\" did it win? (you're about to discover the wonderful world of 'bait and switch as you dig into this :) )

and where did it work? certainly not in canada - it was a failure of epic propotions in bc.  and the federal program has not been working either - which is why they're proposing to jack it up as much as they are. turns out it doesn't work unless you hurt the economy. 

&gt;but without hard deadlines, any plan that relies exclusively on tax breaks will have a serious credibility gap.

that's fair. the rest of what you said before that is largely bullshit, but it is entirely fair to say \"whatever plan you're talking about - show me the reductions and the target dates for it\".  it shouldn't be nebulous - it should be clear. 

but - let me remind you the liberals have regularly missed their stated targets by miles again and again and again for the last 30 years. so - if you're giving them the benefit of the doubt then you really don't give a shit about the environment, you just care about being lied to about it nicely.",liberals

gmuhyrv,2021-02-10T02:48:59.000-08:00,"trudeau pledges $14.9b for public transit projects there's a bunch of reasons. some have to do with the technology, some with the organization, some with the overall planning.

- it's a light metro. this is not inherently bad, but it's being built along high-traffic corridors and in some cases is replacing existing heavy rail. it should be fine for handling traffic in the immediate future but past that, especially along the deux-montagnes route it is going to run into capacity issues with no way to address them (besides rebuilding entirely). it's a less expensive option for the present but will likely result in higher costs in the future.

- it being run by a private organization is bad news. first of all it means that some *very valuable* public infrastructure is being sold for pennies on the dollar. the deux-montagnes line for example is probably worth more than the budget of the entire project (~$6.5 billion) but it's getting handed to cdpq for free.  transit companies in canada have a long history of being combative and i fear that it will be run as a completely separate fief, poorly integrated with other transit in montreal. i suspect (though i'm not certain) that the city is also getting ripped off on the operating agreement and will see far less revenue than they expect.

- control of the mont-royal tunnel means cdpq can strangle any plans for improved rail service from montreal to its northern suburbs (the $700 mil mascouche line has had to be rerouted), or for high-speed rail to qc. they have already declared they won't be making the tunnel useable for other electric trains and the refit they're doing currently is converting away from the 25 kv ac standard to their own. the mont-royal tunnel was the key to future regional or intercity rail for montreal and now it is in the hands of an adversarial organization. it's going to be very difficult to work around that in the future.",liberals

the argument about female workforce participation might justify the program on its own.

but this loose claim that the tax revenues from extra women working will offset program cost is widely repeated, and needs to be debunked. the microeconomics of the issue make it clear:

although childcare is very expensive in canada, most women will already go back to work so long as they earn more than daycare costs. this means that the only women for whom subsidized daycare changes the work vs. stay home decision are low-income women.

it is *clearly* not a net tax revenue gain to pay thousands of dollars a year of childcare subsidies - and given the numbers the liberals talked about, costs could be &gt;$10k/year/child - in order to get women back into the workforce to make &lt;$40k a year (the approximate breakeven in big cities, it's less elsewhere).

the women with promising careers and reasonably-remunerated jobs *already* go back to work. what this policy proposes is paying a huge amount of taxpayer dollars to push all the women without promising jobs or high pay back into the workforce. and in exchange, we trade the superior outcomes associated with parental care in the early childhood years for the somewhat less excellent ones associated with group care settings in the early years.",liberals

a ubi will get the liberals destroyed at the polls because it's the easiest attack path for the cpc possible.

at best they could apply a slight negative income tax model to create a sort of low income floor, but they would sooner improve social services and make them universal than put in ubi.

more palatable and still helps with income redistribution while avoiding pitfalls like how ubi works when there are inflationary pressures rather than deflationary.

having a durable, coherent set of principles /= \"ideological purity.\" 

why do you think we have political parties, exactly? because, what... it's just nice to shake things up a bit every few years??

people create, join, and ally themselves with parties to advance a particular conception of the common good, not to chase the median voter around. of course, there is a risk that principles ossify into doctrine, but i have seen no evidence of that with the ndp. 

who in the party of any significance still talks about supplanting capitalism with socialism or even social democracy? within my lifetime, convention delegates still called each other 'brother smith' and 'brother jones.' none of that is the case anymore. 

for better or (in my view) worse, the reality is that *none* of the major parties in this country deviate very far from vanilla liberal capitalism pared with a more-or-less generous welfare state. 

&gt;looking back at the ndp's best years, it was when they decided to expand their base. that is why they won.

the most consistently successful leader in the ndp's history is indisputably ed broadbent, who during his tenure as leader also served as vice president of the socialist international. as history professor and long-time party activist christo aivalis [describes](https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/todays-ndp-socialism-and-the-partys-legacy):

&gt;while it’s true that broadbent was not averse to compromise or short-term pragmatism, appeals to popularity for him could not interfere with the drive towards democratic socialism: “we believe in equality not because it’s popular. we believe in liberty not because it’s a winner. we believe in social ownership not because of the polls. we believe in these because they are right, we must never forget it.”

&gt;steal your ideas, take credit for them and pass them off as their own.

3. when they feel heard when they feel as if though they are able to do something. to help the world through their ideas. when they have hope. just as you would have hope if you were heard. they will have 0 need to become a nazi.
4. remember those who do the most damage in a fight are often the ones that are the most violent. its not very advisoble to create extremists.

&gt;i will never \"love thy enemy\" when they're waving nazi banners. my family tree was horrendously destroyed not even 100 years ago by these very ideals.

i get your challenges here. my country in the same way was terrorized by \"socialists\" 35 000+ innocent kids, and young adults killed brutally in a span of a tiny time period. this pushes me to hate socialists. socialists who are open to violent revolution. but i have learned to talk to many of them. many who say yes they would kill me if i resist. its hard, but i can do it if i try hard enough. **b u t that is not what im asking you to do, cause that is asking you wayyyyyyyyy too much.**

 im not asking you to love a nazi. im asking you to love a potential nazi. just a normal conservative. who has no hate for you, or people in general. but rather just has different views.

just as a conservative can say the same to me when i tell them to love a lefitist \"you want me to love people who kill innocent babies in their womb????\", \"you want me to listen to them?????\"

and as i answer with a chad **\"yes\"**

so do i ask you to listen to conservatives. not nazis, but conservatives. who are potential nazis, but you could change the course of history by making them feel heard.

hope i explained i better this time.",conservatives

go4tw26,2021-02-20T00:51:30.000-08:00,"majority of canadians think royal family 'no longer relevant' ironically, pierre trudeau saved the monarchy when he repatriated the constitution. under the amending formula, we would need the approval of the senate, the house of commons, the legislative assemblies of ~~7~~ (edit: all) provinces~~, representing at least 50% of canada's population~~.

there is very little chance of such a coalition coming together over something as unimportant to our everyday lives as the canadian monarchy (there have been amendments but they were on smaller questions).

as we saw in the meech accords and then the charlottetown accords, you can't open up the constitution on just one question. the premiers of every province will come, tin cup in hand, with new demands. the premier of québec will say \"hey, we never signed the constitution\". when the range of issues expands, the amendment will grow more contentious (indeed, even explicitly keeping things off the agenda will lower the chance of passage).

you could have a referendum on the monarchy. but even if just the atlantic provinces voted against abolition, their premiers could conceivably deny the amendment passage. and as australia discovered, the alternative to the monarchy matters. you could easily get many people who want to abolish the monarchy, but who oppose the alternatives likely to prevail.

for instance, what if we elected our head of state? it sounds like a reasonable idea, but the question of the rules under which that election took place would benefit some regions and not others. for instance, if it was just one-person-one-vote, the english-speaking majority could easily elect an anglophone unilingual governor-general.

okay, fine, let's just elevate the governor-general, appointed by the prime minister. well okay, but if your argument against the monarchy was that it's undemocratic, prime ministerial appointment isn't particularly democratic either. and shall we say that prime ministers can get it wrong (not to impugn certain recent appointments...).

well what if there was a committee of luminaries that would pick the governor-general. \"oh yeah, and surprise surprise, it'll be a bunch of laurentian elites makin' that call. basically you'll have a council of five john ralston sauls sayin' let's bring back adrienne clarkson.\"

what if we just got rid of the whole head of state altogether? okay, but who would appoint governments, and make determinations in times of uncertainty (e.g. december 2008)? moreover, as we can see, merging the head of state and the head of government changes the role. i like that our prime minister can be a bit of a pugilist because they aren't the symbolic representation of the nation. i'm not so sure i like the way our neighbours to the south handle this question.",liberals

though i would argue that that result relates to party again. canadian alliance experienced a major relative positive swing that election, while the pc's practically imploded across the country. if i'm a voter in that riding looking to swap from liberal to a conservative candidate that election, i definitely wouldn't put my vote on the pc's, with strategic voting and all.
it is interesting for me to see now how drastically the riding swapped that election, from consistently comfortable liberal wins to consistently comfortable conservative wins. though one thing i notice is that the riding stuck with the liberals even once len hopkins retired and elected hec cloutier, who still made a good showing the following election against cheryl. 
so honestly, i would say it's a fair mixture of both effects that we're talking about here. i'm sure she has a fair following in the riding herself, and at the same time, the conservative brand, with or without cheryl, has just been very appealing in the valley for a while.",liberals

the previous conservative government enacted a vigorous vice-regal selection and vetting process that would have prevented mme. payette from becoming gg. pmo sources themselves declared that she was plucked from the senate application process to the gg one because of her celebrity, *her identity*. payette was chosen for her identity as a francophone (as it was a francophones turn), and as an accomplished female astronaut with a history in stem. the pmo skipped the process because of her celebrity stardom and identity, you cannot refute this as you have attempted and failed to do because pmo sources have said as much.

it is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about trudeau's pm selections and appointments when he has history of unqualified and unvetted appointments. 

i am in favour of an indigenous gg but i would like them to be qualified and properly vetted, blocking your ears and 'dirty debating' as another commentator describe you does not absolve you of the harm of your position if a reoccurrence does occur. i would like to see a qualified indigenous or francophone gg (preferably both), *qualified* and i want your aura or negative politics and race baiting left out of it.",liberals

i'm a big fan of one person one vote, but i'm oddly democratic that way. i note that, despite complaints of underrepresentation, no province has set aside 1/3 of provincial seats for first nations representatives - this despite their suffering under the \"settler consensus.\" i don't find the complaint that \"our region is underrepresented\" to be persuasive, given how many 905 ridings are statistically underrepresented and none of those regions are interested in addressing that complaint when it comes internally. 

it's also worth remembering that we had almost 10 years of government recently with next to no representation from quebec, too.

whether they are willing to make reforms or not, the fact is that federal tax policy is significantly contributing to the problem. they should be called out on it. saying, \"federally the government can't do a terrible amount\", is both factually wrong, minimizing a hugely important policy area, and excusing the federal government's substantial role in creating this problem.

gnwxmin,2021-02-18T02:34:22.000-08:00,"almost half of canadians want to eliminate the governor general position: poll you can't eliminate the gg without doing some major constitutional reform, because the gg is involved in a lot of important decisions, like naming the pm and dissolving parliament. in practice, it's true that the gg has little choice in how they exercise that power, yet the gg is ostensibly a check on the power of the pm.

all parliamentary systems in the world have an equivalent position. excepting south africa where parliament elects a president who doubles as prime minister and president. parliamentary systems need a neutral arbiter to adjudicate conflicts. and german states that have \"minister-president\" positions. however, these positions require a constitutional change to provide for their elections if that way is chosen. the advantage of having a separate head of state however is that this is a more flexible arrangement than a constitutional process where if the constitution's authors didn't predict all scenarios, you might face a major problem without any body or person able to decide what should happen.

if we're talking about constitutional change at the top anyway, i think much needs to be done to remove too much power centralized in the pm. basically, as things now stand, the pm can arbitrarily choose (ok, in theory the gg appoints them, but only on the advice of the pm):

* supreme court justices
* judges from federal courts and most provincial superior or appeal courts
* governor-general
* lieutnant-governors
* senators

all of these functions except the governors are lifetime appointments.

i think it would be more sensible if:

* supreme court justices were chosen by a committee including federal and provincial representatives
* judges from provincial courts were selected by provincial governments
* the governor-general was chosen by an electoral college of joint federal and provincial representatives
* lieutnant-governors were selected by provincial governments

vaccination is taking a bit to get going, but we're still doing pretty well for a country without a domestic supply. hopefully things get better in the next couple of months, and in this case, i think april could be a good time to strike while the iron is hot. liberals would have optimism on their side, and that's not to be underestimated. but by fall, that optimism could easily have faded and \"how are we gonna pay for all this\" could become the issue of the day, and that's an issue trudeau is not very good at handling.

...and reading it in detail now, i see that part of the problem for details is that mercedes stephenson doesn't clearly say that she divorced him (or that it's in process). and she seems to even avoid admitting that she had married him.

if she had used the word \"divorce\" on twitter, i know it would have turned-up in one of my google searches earlier.

searching directly on twitter now too, she also didn't admit divorce. her denial is simply to say \"look at my left hand genius\", instead of actually saying she divorced him.  and technically, with that response, she could still be married to the guy, without actually lying in that response.

anyway, i just thought that was interesting, and wanted to add it to this thread in case of whoever else reads this.

coalitions are incredibly, incredibly rare in canadian politics. there's been exactly one at the federal level - a wartime grand coalition during ww1. the last one anywhere in the country was in the 40s in bc. we are not going to end up with a coalition after this election. i'd bet big money on it, except that the odds they'd give me would make it pointless.

if the liberals wind up with the second most seats but want to try to stay in government, we could *maybe* see a confidence and supply agreement between them and the ndp. but even that isn't likely. 

i don't think his progressive/conservative comment was a freudian slip. he was specifically attacking singh for lumping the tories and liberals together accusing him of not caring whether the government is progressive or conservative. emphasizing that the liberals being in power is the only way you can have a progressive government is a good way of trying to claw back support from the ndp.",liberals

even as a liberal voter, i also agree that the election wasn't necessary, mostly because i was perfectly happy for them to continue governing as they were. 

but i also saw the benefit in going back to the electorate, even to reaffirm the current seat distribution, as a fundamentally correct thing to do. the pandemic's impacts are so fundamental to society, that choosing the direction our country takes as we come out the other side of this felt like something worth going to the electorate for. especially with a minority mandate in the first place.

but i would have also have argued an election this summer/fall should have occurred even if the liberals had had a majority.

it made him look weak, and it made him look like his word was worth nothing. and that's going to haunt him into a leadership review. 

i think if it wasn't for that, if he just lost, he could play the humble card and say 'we didn't do good enough but we can do better and we're asking for another chance' and have a good shot at staying in. harper did it. 

but - man you just can't out and out lie to your own people and you can't sell out gun owners an albertans which is what he did by keeping the gun grab and carbon tax and expect to stay leader without a hell of a song and dance.  he would have had to go into the leadership contest willing to put that on the table and explain his reasoning.

more then that though they look poised to gain at least 2 seats in bc, and possibly a third if granville shifts. call me old fashioned but i think parties need strong regional support and the ndp doesn’t really have a fortress like the liberals or cpc do. bc is the closest thing they have so building on that is great.

unfortunately right now there is little opportunity in the east or quebec so the gains are muted overall. but i generally would prefer the ndp to be strongest in the areas of the country where the lpc are not anyways.

17 of the too close to call ridings are lib or former lib out of 27 - meaning if they hold no real movement.
of the 10 others.

bq - berthier-maskinonge is bq against ndp

bq - longueuil–saint-hubert is bq vs lib (possible +1)

ndp - hamilton mountain - liberals are already \"winning this\" in the polls - meaning possible -1 if ndp incumbent gets the mail-ins

cpc - charleswood-st james-assiniboia-headingley - cpc vs liberal, possible +1 for the lpc, -1 cpc

cpc - saskatoon west - cpc vs ndp, possible -1 for the cpc, +1 ndp

cpc - edmonton centre - cpc vs ndp vs lib - could go +1 for either the ndp or lpc, -1 cpc but its a 3 way

cpc -edmonton griesbach - ndp leading already - meaning mail ins might solidify the ndp's numbers or the ndp goes -1 and cpc +1

n/a - vancouver granville - currently lpc lead - lpc vs ndp meaning mail ins either keep it lpc or it goes -1 lpc and +1 ndp

cpc - richmond centre - lpc lead - lpc vs cpc.  means mail ins either keep it status quo lpc or lpc goes -1 and cpc goes +1

grn - nanaimo-ladysmith - ndp lead - ndp vs cpc.  either ndp goes -1 or cons go +1.

but it looks like lpc basically hold what they have and the needle stays, or at most go +3 i think if i am looking at that right but possible to lose more then they gain is higher depending on how the mail-ins lean.

so it looks to be:
lpc best case: +3

lpc worse case (meaning magic lose every mail-in): -20

looking at wikipedia i see the following

\"in february 2017, trudeau dropped support for electoral reform, issuing a mandate to newly appointed minister of democratic institutions karina gould, saying that, \"a clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged. ... changing the electoral system will not be in your mandate.\"\\[19\\] in response to questions from the public in iqaluit, trudeau said \"it is because i felt it was not in the best interests of our country and of our future,\" citing concerns that alternative electoral systems would give too much power to \"extremist and activist voices\" that could create \"instability and uncertainty\" dividing the country.\\[20\\]\"

which kind of sounds like he's wanting to keep canadians from voting for and electing alternative parties.

also, it's not as bad as it is for the ppc, but the green's also have an issue where a bunch of polls will make them look like they're going to make significant gains, only for them to get between 4-7% of the vote at maximum. i'm pretty sure there was a period in the leadup to the 2019 election where the polls showed the greens getting close to the ndp's level of support, but that obviously didn't materialize.

hafrcgi,2021-08-26T01:50:44.000-07:00,"the poll thread - thursday, august 26, 2021 legault released a list of demands to the head of all federal parties. amongst this list, he stresses two demands above all else:

1. the federal government should commit to funding a 30% something percentage of healthcare spending. these should come without specific earmarks or demands. the federal government should also commit to a 6% growth of healthcare spending.
2. family reuinification in quebec should be transfered to quebec.

when talking about 1, he specifically targetted \"two federal parties\" as getting their healthcare plans wrong. when pushed further, he named the plc and ndp. finally, he was asked on if the cpc plan was good and said it was the better of all (would need a full commitment to 30% spending right now to be perfect).

he made a strong point against trudeau's approach. namely, he said that the caq wants to decentralize healthcare to the regions so that the regions may respond to their specific needs. earmarked money would bring an added layer of bureaucracy and management that is not needed currently.

when asked about ltcs he criticized trudeau's approach on the same basis. he said that it lacks flexibility. for example, he says that quebec wants to focus on in-house care instead of ltc and that such earmarking of money + national standards would go against this vision.

as for family reuinification, he stressed the need to intergrate immigrants and french. he talked a lot about nationalism and how the situation for immigration in quebec should be different from canada's vision of multiculturalism. 

people are saying that this campaign is lacking wedge issues. i think legault may have tried to force these wedge issues, at least in quebec.",liberals

haftkiy,2021-08-26T02:05:26.000-07:00,"some questions about the canadian election for question 4, the conservatives keep having a tough time picking a leader because any winning candidate has to appeal to the party’s base of voters and to the general public. the party’s base leans more right, with  organized groups of social conservative voters (anti-abortion, against lgbt equality, troubled by euthanasia). the general public tends to be a little more left, with certain social conservative ideas as deal-breakers.

so would a moderate conservative take over next? the winning candidate has to appear both moderate and appealing to social conservatives, that’s the trick. it looks like proposing to ban sex-selective abortion is one way they may try to do that (not necessarily doing it, just proposing it). that lets a candidate appeal to social-conservatives, but its more popular with the general public than other similar policy ideas. in other parts of the world i’m also seeing trans acceptance being distanced from lgb rights and used as the new wedge issue by socons, but that hasn’t really happened in canada.",conservatives
