i think pharmacare and childcare make sense, so i expect we'll see them. but you're totally correct that while pharmacare, childcare, and ubi are popular, raising taxes to pay for them is unpopular. a policy proposal for an inheritance tax, 100% inclusion of capital gains, and to study a wealth tax was voted down by liberal delegates. (personally i think an inheritance tax and a 75% inclusion rate on capital gains would be good ideas.)

joseph heath comments on [why raising taxes is unpopular](http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-postscript-no-1/):

&gt; [naomi klein and peter victor] expect people to support increased redistribution at the same time that *their own incomes are declining*. this leaves me at something of a loss – i struggle to find words to express the depth of my incredulity at this proposition. in what world has this, or could this, ever occur?
&gt;
&gt; in the real world, economic recessions are rather strongly associated with a significant increase in the nastiness of politics. economic growth, on the other hand, makes redistribution much easier, simply because **the transfers do not show up as absolute losses to individuals who are financing them, but rather as foregone gains, which are much more abstract**. it’s not an accident that the welfare state was created in the context of a growing economy. (see benjamin friedman, *the moral consequences of economic growth*, for a general discussion of the effect of growth on politics.)

because over the medium term we expect the economy to grow, you can raise tax rates without imposing losses on people (and thereby losing elections) - but there's a limit to how quickly you can do this. again, the liberals want to make canada better *and* win elections, so they're always going to be moving more slowly than the ndp would prefer, since i think it's fair to say that the (federal) ndp is less concerned about winning elections. (hence the comment about the ndp being \"liberals in a hurry.\")

the liberals did raise taxes on the top 1%, with the $200,000 tax bracket, and by tightening taxation of passive income within private corporations. thinking about the upcoming budget, though, i wouldn't expect significant measures to tighten fiscal policy (like raising taxes) until the economy is back at full employment.

also, after cerb ended the crb and other benefits were only going to be $400/week initially prior to an agreement with the ndp so they would support the throne speech.

&gt;one week later the liberals announced a new program—cerb, the $2,000 per month canadian emergency response benefit. but it continued to be a complicated program that cut people out. singh and his caucus again pointed to gaps. and on april 15, the trudeau government took what it called “decisive action,” expanding cerb eligibility to include seasonal workers and some others not eligible for ei.

&gt;on march 11, the trudeau government also introduced a 10 per cent wage subsidy program for hard-hit businesses. singh brought together a coalition of union leaders and small business owners to press for wage support of 75 per cent. and on march 27, the trudeau government did that, too.

&gt;for weeks singh and his caucus advocated for students, excluded from cerb, who face bleak summer job prospects. finally on april 22, the trudeau created the canada emergency student benefit.

&gt;singh has ramped up his call for a national paid sick leave plan. and after a week of trudeau saying that wasn’t his jurisdictional concern, on may 25, singh got the pm on-side.

the ars technica article is reporting on a white paper published by the international council on clean transportation, read the white paper yourself if you don't trust ars technica's reporting. it's right here, and says that the lifetime emissions of evs are already drastically lower than gas cars:

https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/global-lca-passenger-cars-jul2021_0.pdf

and sorry, where in your cbc post do they cite a life cycle analysis of vehicle emissions? or is that article just fud and random scare quotes from experts with no actual research to back up it's central topics? 

&gt;the reality is evs as they exist aren't better for the environment. now maybe they will be at some future when we learn how to reuse our batteries, but it's misleading to say that we're already there

it's not misleading whatsoever. go ahead and read that white paper. they already are. do you know how much upstream pollution the fossil fuel industry causes? not to mention the acute and local environmental disasters? 

right now, we flat out cannot afford to keep burning fossil fuels while meeting our climate goals, and incentivizing ev purchases will unquestionably influence the market to purchase them instead of fossil fuel vehicles. lithium mining and battery recycling are minor hurdles compared to getting the trillions of dollars that go to fossil fuel vehicles and infrastructure going to electric.",liberals

those oligopolies were heavily regulated with specific requirements and achievable tasks they must have compelted to remain where they were. and for the most part they did.

for example. bell was tasked with running the copper lines to connect the country (before the internet). it's why they own basically all phone lines.

rogers/shaw/telus depending on region, were tasked with the installation of cable.

so we half hassed an oligopoly based economy, than half assed moving to a free market economy.'

your argument serves equally well as an argument justifying the prohibition of lgbt advocacy groups.  assuming that's what the doctors think.  and they do think weird things at times. 

case in point.  i am in a polyamorous relationship.  (an all gay one, fwiw.)  what happens if medical practitioners decide that that's a harmful pattern of behaviour and i should really just commit?  this isn't a thought experiment.  doctors and psychiatrists testified at the supreme court with the polygamy law case.  they argued that it's psychologically harmful, sociologically unbalanced, even unnatural, and so on.  i hear echoes of the past there.

or just plain ol' unsafe gay sex.  that's *definitely* harmful.  can we ban it too?  maybe ban pornography that shows sex without condoms.   maybe ban the sex clubs.  no joke.  it's what the doctors advise, in many cases.  and it would probably reduce some harm, right?  

and i haven't even mentioned the people in weird-ass bdsm relationships.

basically, i would not be surprised if doctors conclude that people like me in polyamorous relationships, or those guys who have lots of casual unprotected sex, are in fact mentally ill.  self-harming deviants.  people who needed to be protected from themselves.  psychiatry in the 60s all over again.

so if doctors argue that, then what happens to polyamory support groups?  what happens to sex clubs?  can it all be banned too in the name of minimizing harm?  i can't say i'm comfortable with my liberty being contingent on whatever the medical wonks think is or isn't harmful or normal.

i thought hard about this because it seems like a paradox to me.  personally, i've concluded that adults can, in fact, consent to things deemed harmful by others, even by the great majority of society.  it's not our job to control what they choose to subject themselves to.  if they are still free to walk away, then it's not really our business to tell them what they can or cannot torture or injure themselves with.",conservatives

i bought my car before carbon taxes were a thing.  it was the only viable option then, and it remains so today.  with current technology and infrastructure, an ev simply isn't practical.  and i'd grown sick and tired of public transit after relying on it exclusively for 15 years.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;it only applies to provinces that refuse to set their own carbon pricing.

funny you should mention that, given the liberals are refusing to allow other provinces to negotiate deals like the one they gave new brunswick.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the tax will not be ruinous, vehicles get more efficient every year.

except people don't replace their vehicles that frequently (and those that do.. well, the environmental impact of that choice greatly outweighs any incremental fuel savings).  my car is low mileage, properly maintained, and stored in a garage protected from the elements.  i see no reason why it wouldn't last me for another 10 years.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i’m having a challenge finding information documenting that the liberals said they would never raise the carbon tax. just that there were no plans to raise it beyond $50 until 2022. yes it’s political doublespeak.

i don't recall exactly when.. but i distinctly remember the liberals explicitly denying they would raise the price after 2022 when their opposition accused that they'd do exactly that.  it might have been in the leader's debate, don't quote me on that.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;so i guess my question is: what’s your counterproposal to meet and exceed the paris 2030 and the new 2050 targets?

to start.. a global ban on using coal power within a reasonable timeframe (say, five years).  the fact that certain countries (cough.. china) are continuing to build **new** coal plants simply boggles the mind.",liberals

the cpc is promising 1 million homes over 3 years, including taking credit for the private market which is expected to build 750,000-800,000 in that period anyway, and no affordability commitments. they're basically just saying they will incentivize the market and expect the market will come up with that.

the liberals are doing the same thing of including what the market was going to build anyway and claiming 1.4 million homes built/preserved/renovated over 4 years. within that number, they only committed to building 100,000 more market rate housing. they're also adding some more funding to the funding to the coinvestment fund which translates to another 12k units, but they've only spent half of what was budgeted in that fund for the last 3 years, so budgeting more money won't really build anything if they aren't spending it.

over 1 million of the liberal homes is just what the market is going to build anyway if they don't do anything. they did what the cpc did, then added a year and got a bigger number thanks to that. they're also further boosting up that number by adding in renovations and preserved (social) housing, but that's basically funding that has been budgeted for years already.

because i think this is a half measure and it's not addressing the problem. i don't think we should be pumping oil the way we are in the first place, nor should we be relying on oil revenue so heavily. this isn't *entirely* at the liberals feet either, the prior cpc government that relied so heavily on oil puts us in this position too and gave a big push to the trend of canada selling its natural resources and selling out our companies to foreign ownership while not funding or actively suppressing the other ways that canada has strengths in. just like we have seen in the many previous oil price drops and crises, canada's expensive tar-sands and small pumping capacity means we're always the first on the chopping block when we have to play against opec, the saudis, and russia, which leads us to having a weak link in our economy that's highly vulnerable to much bigger global players that we have no control over, in a product that the world is trying to switch away from. i think the liberals supporting the tmx and investing our money in such a project is highly risky for our economy and continues to support the oil industry as a whole. 

the liberals have had many years to do more on climate change but they are still playing the game of moderate/centrist policies and giving half measures to people who want more action one hand, while continuing to provide subsidies and support on major pipeline projects with the other hand.

we have such an incredible opportunity as a county to do so much better. we're one of the most respected western nations with a stable and mostly reasonable government when compared to the political turmoil in our allies countries, and a standard of living and natural beauty that is some of the best in the world. we have a good education system, and brilliant engineers, and we could attract so many bright people from around the world to immigrate here and support our existing tech sectors and help fund an energy sector that isn't reliant on natural resources. we already do this with nuclear power and we are one of the larger global players in reactor designs and engineering, and we could do exactly the same with renewables and create a service and sales sector that can reform not only our own energy production and provide us a national security advantage by reducing our dependence on foreign buyers of our natural resources, but we can also sell the world renewable energy services that could replace oil and gas with higher quality, sustainable jobs, and preserve our natural beauty at the same time.

we can do this; we have done this many times before: black berry, avro canada, the csa and it's contributions to the iss and space flight, to name a few. if only we have had our government to provide more support (exlc. the canadarm and our csa, that is a huge success) to these sectors instead of constantly failing our tech sector and instead defaulting to cutting down trees and digging black shit out of the ground we would be better off. avro in particular is a good comparison here because we're now so far behind the world in aerospace that we can't just reboot the old projects; we had a lead and we lost it due to politics. our energy sector is at risk the same way: the more we rely on half measures and kick the can down the road the harder it's going to be to become a leader in this sector in the future. 

the liberals choices on the pipeline revealed to me that they're more of the same. they're never going to commit hard on climate change the way we need to; they have no vision.

&gt;as far as i know, the ndp haven't stated that they want to shut down oil sands production so without tmx

no, but they are platforming the reduction or removal of the oil and gas subsidies. that's at least a step better than the liberals.",liberals

look at what happened in 2019 when scheer lost.  the urban ontario, quebec and maritime conservatives gave up because their leader was waffling on issues that would make them lose if discussed (hot button issues out west but decided and moved on issues everywhere else).  then the people who ended up removing him removed him because he didn't take a strong stand on those issues.  when a third of the party is disenfranchised whenever you make a comment on policy (no matter the comment) it is probably a bigger sign about the party then the person making comments.",conservatives

lots of dem ideas poll well, but that is not enough. when it comes time to put those ideas into a bill, with the required funding to make it work, then these ideas fall apart because there is not enough support for the spending and the debt or tax increases to pay for them. also the reality of the us congress means that majority support in national polls doesn't translate into majority support in congress. the very fragile democratic senate majority relies on senators from r-leaning states like arizona (r+3) and west virginia (r+23, the second highest partisan lean). pretending like these areas don't actually have conservative voters ready to flip their vote to r if their current dem senator votes for big spending - is just silly.

well, consider own bias here. the many conservative voters in arizona and wv  would have different opinions of what  a \"moderate\" social spending bill looks like.

the ppc was formed because bernier was angry that he didn't get to be the leader of the cpc, so he threw a tantrum and decided to form his own party. that toddler-level tantrum has thus attracted other people who act like, and have the iq of a toddler.

does this make the issue partisan? no. because i do not think that all conservatives will fail to act appropriately in a crisis. nor do i think that any other political ideology would necessarily fare better—it just depends on how a given leader responds to facts on the ground.

i also think people aren't really buying his claim that parliament wasn't working well under a minority government. clearly it was able to pass cerb as well as begin working towards affordable childcare deals for the provinces, and historically speaking minority liberal governments are when canada gets a lot of new or expanded social programs because they're forced to collaborate with other parties.",liberals

ha30fs8,2021-08-23T07:30:34.000-07:00,"which is more important to you in leaders; moral character or the ability to win? well in the world of politics it generally 'works' on a system of risk and reward. the problem with trudeau's hypocrisy and bad behavior and corruption is that his supporters haven't been punishing him for it. they keep voting him in - so for him he's learned that if he tells them what they want to hear then that's far more important than his actual behavior. 

as is often said - people get the gov't they deserve. 

so if you go up to a liberal voter and ask if integrity and consistancy is important they'll say 'oh yes for sure',  but their actions will be the opposite in the voting booth. 

for what it's worth, both ndp and conservative voters do have an extensive history of punishing bad behavior. and it tends to show in their leaders - harper for example, it was frequently said that you may not like what he promises but that's what you'll get whether you want it or not :)  layton had a history of that too actually.

the problem is more about being tribal. many voters, and the libs are by far the worst for it, would rather see their team win even if it's bad for canada and politics. it's like rooting for your home team. and the problem is if one political party rewards bad behavior, pretty soon the others give up trying to play by the rules and sink to that level in order to 'level the playing field', and suddenly you've got a race to the bottom. 

so you're asking the wrong questions. the real question is \"is it more important that your team win than it is to punish a bad leader for bad behaivor?\" the cpc knows that a leader who's a bad leader will be trashed and the party will be taken down with it, as the pc party was.  the ndp know that their people will turn on them too if they're unethcial. if the libs knew that with certainty then you'd get better liberal leaders - not because they'd be better people but because the punishment is that the party gets trashed if they don't.",liberals

a good example of this would be parts of andrew sheers platform in 2019.
ie, \"climate change isn't real\" or the idea that increasing investments in oil and gas is a good idea long term - with the whole \"the oil boom is right around the corner!\" trope. or even just the idea that all public spending is bad. 

i'd also consider the failure to develop policies and ideas regarding emerging technologies and problems a result of ideological calcification as well. for example the lack of coherent ideas about internet and phone data infrastructure, or the the effects of the internet economy and a decentralized information network.

well what do you mean by \"we\"? if you mean the government of canada, that would be because the ability to do so was sold off by the mulroney government in the early 1980s. the idea was that the free market would be able to provide in a timely manner so there was no need for federal spending on it any longer (lol). and no subsequent government has thought to try and rebuild some of that capacity until trudeau's investments last summer into building a nrc facility that will be able to make 2 million doses a month. that facility won't be online until probably the fall. 

if you mean private industry located in canada, the truth is that there is a fairly substantial vaccine production infrastructure located in canada that produces millions of vaccine a year. for example, the majority of the seasonal flu shots used in canada are made by glaxosmithkline in a vaccine plant in [ste-foy, québec](https://ca.gsk.com/en-ca/about-us/gsk-in-canada/). sanofi pasteur makes polio, diphtheria, tetanus, influenza, and tuberculosis vaccines at its facility in [toronto](https://www.sanofi.com/-/media/project/one-sanofi-web/websites/global/sanofi-com/home/media-room/fact-sheet/factsheet_sp_torontosite_en.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=87efc95ab95e41b6dda8a68afb242a1d) (which is the old connaught labs that mulroney sold off), and there's two expansions under construction by sanofi that will make toronto one of the largest centres of vaccine production in the world. 

as for why sanofi or gsk can't make rona vaccines at their canadian facilities? the two firms actually had initially partnered together to develop a rona vaccine but their candidate didn't pan out. neither facility is likely equipped to produce the biontech/pfizer shot or moderna shot under license as those mrna vaccines require highly specialized technology. but as for why they won't license the oxford/az or janssen/j&amp;j shots, which are produced via more traditional methods? i dunno. doing so would mean not producing those other vaccines, which remain needed as those diseases (other than the flu) haven't gone away.

other than the two giants it's all small fry here in canada that can't really produce at a large scale. [last october](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/10/23/prime-minister-announces-funding-advance-development-canadian-covid) medicago did get a nearly $200 million investment from the feds to build a large vaccine production facility in québec but that'll be a while before that's ready. emergent has a mrna capable vaccine production facility in winnipeg that the feds [have reportedly](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-plans-to-help-us-drug-giant-expand-winnipeg-vaccine-production/) been in talks to subsidize an expansion.",liberals

no need to wonder about this, it's already been studied in depth and there are some well-accepted figures. as of 2012, over the whole lifecycle of a solar panel, you're currently looking at around 40-50g of c02 per kwh. that includes upstream costs like mining of silicon, and downstream costs like disposal. 

[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56487.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/56487.pdf)

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230547735\\_life\\_cycle\\_greenhouse\\_gas\\_emissions\\_of\\_crystalline\\_silicon\\_photovoltaic\\_electricity\\_generation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230547735_life_cycle_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_crystalline_silicon_photovoltaic_electricity_generation)

by comparison, natural gas is outputting around 200g of c02 per kwh just at the powerplant and not counting extraction and processing, nor counting the less-studied methane emissions. coal is closer to 1kg at the powerplant. 

it's also worth noting that the natural gas and coal numbers are not likely to change much, while solar will improve significantly in the next decade both thanks to economies of scale as well as recycling of materials lowering the upstream costs.",liberals

h60eqn7,2021-07-21T01:11:00.000-07:00,"cbc news vote compass - nova scotia 2021 provincial election yeah i feel like provincial politics in the maritimes are a remnant of old-school canadian brokerage politics, where liberals and tories have basically the same ideology, their difference is more in who they appeal to and what they prioritize. ancestral voting patterns are a big thing too, with catholics and francophones more deferential to the liberals, while protestants and anglos lean pc (nowhere is this more obvious than in new brunswick where language politics is huge)

ontario used to be like this too, for a long time tories were the wasp party, while liberals were more oriented toward catholics, francophones, and immigrants. this meant the provincial tories often represented left-leaning toronto (which was historically very wasp and loyalist influenced), and liberals often represented right-wing parts like renfrew county and southwestern ontario, which are more catholic and of non-british european heritage. bill davis' tories were sometimes considered more economically left wing and \"big government\" than his more rural-oriented liberal opposition.

ontario diversified heavily, these old-school political divides started losing their relevance, and we started to see more of an ideological gap emerging between the liberals and tories. the right-wing liberal vote started disappearing under mcguinty and completely vanished by the time wynne was leader, and the left-wing pc vote was killed off by mike harris' strongly right wing pc government. today it's pretty clear in ontario which party leans more to the left and which leans more to the right (not counting the ndp because they've always  been left wing).

it's interesting that the further west you go, the more ideological the political divides get and less identity-based. in the atlantic, the liberal-tory divide is still not that ideological, except arguably new brunswick. in quebec, the qlp and caq have clear differences on cultural issues but not really on economics, and we see a fierce montreal-reste du québec divide. ontario provincial politics are the median of canadian politics, with the liberals and tories roughly occupying the same spot as federally. as you go into the western provinces it's even more ideologically polarized, with all four western provinces being ndp vs the right wing.",liberals

pmbs can't spend money. this shows just how useless they are if the only things they have to offer are things the liberals plan on doing *once they have provincial buy-in* (a fact that jagmeet conveniently ignores in his breathless quest to blame trudeau for everything, while taking credit when the sun rises and sets). all they do is heckle from the cheap seats and put forth pmbs that can't spend money, or empty symbolic motions \"calling on\" the government to do x that get voted down as redundant or an overshoot. one of those motions called on the liberals to \"do dental care,\" but the text itself was basically calling on them to implement the entirety of the ndp platform (which doesn't really differ all that much from the liberals, so what's the point). then when it gets inevitably voted down, they offer up a complaining tweet and a fundraising link saying trudeau is against x even though x is already something the liberals are working on. or it's something that trudeau objectively cannot do, like seizing jeff bezos' wealth or federalizing provincial authority.

they don't have anything to differentiate themselves policy-wise, so they campaign on empty procedural statements worded in such a way as to \"feel\" like \"justin trudeau is a big meanie who wouldn't do this.\" i mean why vote ndp in the first place, if they'll just add more mps who complain that the liberals won't do this thing that they're already doing, or can't legally do and the ndp can't either? and then join up with the cpc to obstruct and play procedural games and make theatrical speeches aimed at making the liberals seem cold and uncaring.

sorry, but it's far more true than it is false.  guns are a very narrow side issue and frankly not a great wedge issue, as there is significant support even in the conservative party for the ban.  perhaps not the ppc, but they're really a fringe party, with little clout.

&gt;section 44 clearly gives the power to regulate the parliament of canada itself to the parliament. dissolution regulation would be among those rules.   

except it's not. dissolution is a royal power, not a parliamentary power.  therefore it would be subject to section 41a, the unanimous formula. see the concluding section in the paper below for constitutional expert opinion. it says parliament could change the life of the parliament from 5 years to 4 years through section 44, but changing the power of dissolution would require an amendment under section 41.

where he described himself as being so out of touch with canada, it's people and politics, that he could be considered the proverbial martian studying an alien civilization. he wrote,


&gt; \"the third risk i am taking is more serious, i am writing about the rights talk of a country of which i am a citizen, but in which i have not resided since 1969. in some sense these lectures are my attempt to catch up with the turbulent history of my country in the very years i was abroad. so it may read oddly to those who lived these years in canada, who fought or watched the battles described in these pages. **to them, this book may seem like a report by a visitor from a distant planet. i want to alert my readers that i am a martian outsider. martians can never hope to grasp the tacit knowledge of real human beings.**\"

if you're protesting to the point where the person feels unsafe, then it's cancel culture.

yeah people actually do have an issue with that. especially if they're 'angry' enough that an event has to be shut down.

sure they would. but the gov't would be afraid to do anything about it. that doesn't make it right and it doesn't mean we should do it.

i'm not arguing about whether or not she made a poor decision. i agree she should be fired. i'm saying doug downey is not culpable for her actions, which is a pretty serious legal term to throw around.
i'm perfectly aware of staffer's responsibilities, thanks. 

&gt;do politicians hire their own staff? if they are smart they do

politicians who have too much time on their hands hire their own staff. cabinet ministers have no such luxury. 100% of hiring is done by their chief of staff. 

&gt;keep in mind you are talking quite literally about only a few people, who are their staffers. were also not talking about moj employees, as they are civil servants

you seem to be a bit confused about how the structure of downey's office works. you have his mpp staffers, some would be stationed at his constituency office, and some in his queen's park office, probably between 5 and 10 individuals. this woman does not belong to that office, which her facebook profile makes pretty clear. then you have the wider moj, which consists of hundreds of staffers, basically everyone who operates the functions of the ministry including the courts and prosecutors' offices. this woman however, works for the office of the attorney general, which would be between 50 and 100 staff members spread across departments like comms, policy, issues, operations, tour, etc. the chief of staff was responsible for her hiring, because the chief hires all core ministry staff. she does not work for doug downey, the mpp. she works for his title, which he happens to currently occupy. if he were to be shuffled to another ministry tomorrow, she would work for whoever the new ag was, unless downey asked her to join him at his new ministry. hope that clears it up.",liberals

i saw an interview with jean chrétien and he said it is much harder to be a politician now. when he was pm and something happened, he usually had hours or days to respond due to the speed of which information went out. now with the internet and the fast pace of information, you have seconds to respond. politicians literally have to be on their toes ever second of the day, otherwise they are immediately considered incompetent. 

pretend trudeau was in the middle of a town hall meeting, and at the same moment some disaster happened. there would be a chance that someone would see that on their phone and ask him about it in the town hall. he would have 0 chance to find out what happened at that moment or have any information on it. people would call him an idiot, blame him for not doing something at that moment, or not having an immediate solution without having the information.

we saw this during the fires in ft mcmurray. when they were determined to be a problem, the pmo reached out to the ab firefighters to see what they can do. the pmo was told to stay in ottawa, the firefighters were trying to assess the situation and figure out how to beat handle it. instead, to arrange for help and support for the people in the area and firefighters. they did that, they arranged for more fire fighters, helped arrange evacuations, arranged to get supplies delivered to the front line. yet, pmjt was criticized for not being there. so, the expectation was to immediately drop the phone, get in a plane and run to the front lines to help fight the fire? that's an idiotic expectation.",liberals

if after all that or  there are somehow no other parties and both get 169 seats, then there is a problem.  someone had to sit in the speakers chair and won't get a chance to vote unless they break a tie (a speaker breaks the tie traditionally  in favour of the government). both parties would appeal to someone in the other party to step up to the chair.  neither would want to lose the power so they would be mad at anyone who took that deal.

to look at another side of things, if people are paying to receive prompt service at these privately paid mri clinics, that must mean that those mri machines are not running at full capacity.  if these machines were at full capacity, the queues for the privately paid for mris would be just as long as the public queue.  if anything the saskatchewan model shows how a two-tier system hurts universal care.  these mri machines exist, yet these clinics find it more profitable to under-utilize these machines so that people can book an appointment quickly and conveniently.  if these machines were all turned to serving the public queue and were fully utilized then the wait times on the public queue would be shortened.",conservatives

im not sure this is the right question. there's no doubt that the lpc is underperforming expectations, but they've led every poll but one, and most seat models project them winning a plurality. remember, they won a strong minority* despite losing the pv in 2019. the liberal vote is very efficient, because trudeau has made ontario a fortress.

do i think it's too late for trudeau to turn the campaign around, and slip away from the cpc's reach in the polls? absolutely not, because the campaign only just began. when the liberals release a platform, parties start knocking on as many doors as they can find, and perhaps most importantly the debates take place, we'll get a better picture of what's gonna happen.

that said though, it's increasingly hard to see a liberal majority, which many expected just a few weeks ago. the cpc has returned to their 30% floor, and the liberals are struggling to cross 35%, neither of which bodes well for trudeau. so far this is the weakest of trudeau's three campaigns as liberal leader, he's gonna have to turn up the dial or he just might face the same fate as ian rankin in nova scotia did a couple days ago.

it's the most cliché thing in canadian politics, but absolutely worth repeating: campaigns matter! no party can afford to be complacent, because how canadians behave during the writ period can vary vastly from off-election times when many, if not most people tune out of federal politics.",liberals

it will s important to note- not all adults seek it out of their own volition. many are forced, manipulated, or threatened into attending (or risk losing their families, jobs, homes, communities, etc).

this argument doesn't make much sense in the context of this story. whether or not the form letter was a mistake, the first letter wasn't suggesting the organization was rejected because the individuals weren't black enough. it was that there was an insufficient number of people who self-identified as black. from what i can tell, the government isn't deciding who is and isn't black enough. they're making a determination based on how many people who self-identify as black are in positions of leadership. 

&gt;but king’s firm belief in the importance of character is timeless, and the trudeau administration could learn something from the civil rights icon. if government officials are solely fixated on the colour of the leaders applying for grants, then they will not appropriately weigh the character of the leaders entrusted with public dollars to support communities with urgent needs. character does matter.

the mlk stuff is a separate issue all together. i think it's an issue on which reasonable people can reasonably disagree in good faith. whether or not social programmes that aim to support a demographic to ameliorate social inequality as it pertains to race are ultimately beneficial or harmful in the short, medium and long term is something people can disagree about. though i think the invocation of mlk for this argument is a bit pointless. what mlk would have advocated today is an unanswerable question. it's also a pretty low quality argument in my mind to suggest that mlk's ultimate goal (character over race) is not the same goal as the government here and those who support affirmative action programmes. of course they do, they just don't believe we have reached a social condition where racial roadblocks are no longer a meaningful impediment to social justice.",liberals

this means that the whole point of a guarantee is that if the investment goes awry, the guarantor pays up so that the primary investor doesn't take a hit. this means two things: first, it is exceedingly unlikely for there to be an escape clause in the contract, as it would mean the guarantee wasn't really a guarantee and, second, that even if clever lawyers were to find an \"out\", a court would likely find that \"out\" to be unconscionable, be based on misleading and therefore inapplicable language or interpret it very narrowly, as it would defeat the purpose of the guarantee contract for the government to weasel out of its guarantee. 

while conservatives in canada have been known to use sovereign powers to tear up contracts on a whim, there are consequences when using these powers in international business, as it hurts your credibility, in every sense of the word, as a partner for trade and investment.

(the openmedia page links to a very high level summary, not the paper itself). it's not an overly long read, and i find it is always good to read a source document when possible.

the entire gist of the policy document is to try to ensure that copyright infringement is curtailed and that intermediaries (i.e. isps, hosting platforms) have certain processes to follow when they know that they have infringement going on - while still trying to ensure that the any member of the canadian public is not negatively impacted by these changes, and that these intermediaries aren't punished when infringement is going on on their platforms that they are not aware of (i may have paraphrased or misunderstood the policy doc - please feel free to correct me based on the source doc).

i think when it comes to the claims of website blocking that openmedia is making, it is from this section:

&gt;**4.4.1 establish a statutory basis and procedure for injunctions against intermediaries**  
&gt;  
&gt;the act could be amended to provide expressly for injunctions against intermediaries to prevent or stop online copyright infringement facilitated by their services even where they are not themselves liable for it, such as where they may be protected by the safe harbours. these injunctions could be available through a court process to ensure the highest standards of procedural fairness. the specific relief possible through such injunctions could include orders to disable access to infringing content (e.g., \"website-blocking\" or \"de-indexing\" orders), remove such content (e.g., \"takedown\" orders), otherwise prevent or stop infringing activity (e.g., \"stay-down\" orders) or limit, suspend or terminate access to an intermediary's service.footnote53 such orders would only apply in respect of specific instances of infringement and would not impose obligations to monitor for potential infringement writ large.  
&gt;  
&gt;it could be specified that such orders be available in at least certain cases without the need first to obtain judgment directly against the alleged infringer or include the alleged infringer as a party to the proceedings. obtaining judgment against such commercial-scale online infringers can raise a host of unique challenges. many such entities' anonymity and presence outside of canada exacerbate the usual issues of time, cost and uncertainty in infringement proceedings, even considering the possibility of default judgment or expedited proceedings. nevertheless, an alleged infringer could be permitted to join the proceedings as a party on application. as an additional safeguard, it could also be clarified that a rights holder would only be able to forego obtaining judgment directly against an alleged infringer first where the rights holder has made a good faith but unsuccessful effort to identify the alleged infringer and stop the alleged infringement.  
&gt;  
&gt;courts' discretion in granting such injunctions could be subject to certain further conditions set out in legislation or regulation. these conditions would require balancing of the rights and interests of the rights holder, intermediary and alleged infringer as well as the public. in this way, the scheme would balance the policy objectives and related priorities of the copyright framework for online intermediaries more generally. for instance, a rights holder could be required to demonstrate the following, based on canadian jurisprudence and models of other jurisdictions:  
&gt;  
&gt;**prima facie infringement** – there appears at first instance to be a strong case of the rights holder's copyright having been infringed;  
&gt;  
&gt;**prior notice** – the intermediary has been notified of the infringement;  
&gt;  
&gt;**technical feasibility** – the intermediary would be able to perform the relief sought;  
&gt;  
&gt;**irreparable harm** – the rights holder would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted (e.g., because the rights holder would suffer losses that would not be readily quantifiable or compensable in the circumstances or potentially alternative, less onerous methods available that the rights holder might pursue to target the infringement would be significantly less effective or ineffective);  
&gt;  
&gt;**effectiveness** – the injunction would be likely to prevent or stop the infringement or at least make the infringing activity more difficult to achieve or infringing content more difficult to access, in view of the likely effects of the injunction on the behaviour of both the alleged infringer and users;  
&gt;  
&gt;**complexity and cost** – the complexity and cost of implementing the relief sought on the intermediary would not unduly burden the intermediary or its lawful services;  
&gt;  
&gt;**effect on users** – the relief sought would not unduly affect the ability of users to access or make use of content lawfully or the exercise of their freedom of expression; and  
&gt;  
&gt;safeguards – the relief sought would include measures protecting against potential abuse, such as measures to ensure lawful content would not be affected.  
&gt;  
&gt;this scheme could allow for additional limits on the scope of such injunctions in light of certain intermediary arguments. for instance, a court could limit the proposed application of such an injunction where an intermediary has established that compliance would violate the laws of another jurisdiction given the extra-territorial nature of the internet.  
&gt;  
&gt;establishing such a remedy in legislation could be warranted. to begin with, there is already a legal basis for such orders. as noted above, canadian courts have recently issued such orders in the case of \"website-blocking\" by isps and \"de-indexing\" by search engines through the courts' equitable jurisdictions. further, as the courts noted in those cases, there is also precedent for the enlistment of third parties in the enforcement of one's rights. nevertheless, setting out this remedy in legislation could save parties from unnecessary litigation by proactively specifying the various other types of cases in which such remedies would be available, the procedures vis-à-vis alleged infringers and appropriate safeguards. this legislative scheme could moreover deter litigation by encouraging intermediaries, rights holders and others to work together to establish a suitable framework for dealing with alleged infringements facilitated by the intermediaries' services. risk of litigation could be further offset by combination with other options described herein.

it sounds like from a website blocking/de-indexing point of view, this is something that the current copyright act (2012) already covers, so it looks like it would be codifying something that is already occurring based on the current laws. again, i could be simplifying it.

i could be interpreting the policy document wrong, but i cannot see where the policy document does this, as per openmedia's linked article:

&gt;on april 14, the federal government launched a “consultation on a modern copyright framework for online intermediaries”. in the policy paper for the consultation, the government proposes giving itself sweeping censorship powers to demand our isps and other online intermediaries — folk like our libraries, universities, and online platforms — block access to websites through their services.

if it indeed does this, then it would be going against the very goals of what the policy document is stating ([goals of this consultation](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/693.nsf/eng/00191.html#s2)) which is to:

* to protect and encourage the use of copyright-protected content online
* to safeguard individual rights and freedoms in an open internet
* to facilitate a flourishing digital market

i'm really not sure as of yet what sort of outcomes the proposed policy doc (and it's a summary of many different ideas) would lead to, but - as the policy document is now - i'm slightly skeptical that it is going to lead to the censorship scenarios that openmedia is claiming. i think it would be a very good idea to see what comes out of the consultation process and keep close tabs on what comes out of it.",liberals
