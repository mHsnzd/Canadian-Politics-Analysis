the election in 2015 showed the non-cpc vote moving back and forth between the ndp and lpc, before coalescing around trudeau at the end.   you can look at the polls yourself, the cpc was relatively stable throughout that campaign with the lpc and ndp rising and falling in mirroring trends.

the federal government imposing a top down framework on the provinces something the report specifically advises against.

the federal government does have a role in ensuring this is implemented, but the first step needs to be collaboration and negotiation with the provinces who will be delivering this program.  the report estimates implementing this program could take 8 years from start to finish.    simply passing a bill and telling provinces how the program will work with no prior negotiation is not going to get pharmacare achieved.",liberals

again, i ask, do you disavow your father because he tried to help you have fun somehow, yet the result is you end up injured?  this is what the protestors have done.  and again, he wasn't one of the people that wanted them to suffer.  he, like our fathers, may have been arrogant, but he wanted them to succeed, as our fathers wanted us to have fun.

&amp;#x200b;

and here is the thing you must understand; 99% of all canadians wanted the indians (as they were called at the time) killed, destroyed, objectively lower than any european could ever been.  for the time, ryerson would have had death threats for the policy he proposed, not because it didn't benefit or do justice enough to the natives, but because it looked as though they were making the indians too advanced.  ryerson is a tremendous advancement to aboriginal and european healing; he may have messed up on all of it, but it was leaders like him and john a. macdonald that saved us from killing them of as in the states, and starting, albeit it greatly flawed, the only path of healing the world has ever seen.  no other country has done as much to heal, to ask for forgiveness, than the canadian one; we still have a ways to go, but we are 100s of times farther than any other country thanks to them.  most countries don't even recognize these things \\[stares at japan\\], and it is thanks to the guy who no longer has a statue that we are that best country here.

i honestly think that if he saw the abuses committed, every single teacher that committed such an abuse would be in trial and forever fired; he would have made it so, that is how much he cared for the first natives. in fact, the few i know that were in good schools, that being ones without cruel and racist teachers, a lot of them said that they actually were benefited by it; a native dentist that i know of (from my grandpa) said that without it, he could never be one of the most successful dentists in all of alberta.  again, it may have been cultural genocide, but i made a much longer comment (if you ask me about it, i'll give you a link) about how today, we still treat them terribly; the shocking thing is, the horrors are still similar, changed, but at the same rate, and the fact is, besides the abuses, more than half of all natives today are in worse conditions that they would have been in residential schools (in fact, a good number of them have been abused as their parents don't know how to properly love; most residential schools took them from it, so even when we talk about abused, a great number of natives are abused today), and even then, even with the horrors of the residential school, more natives benefited from them than they do with out policies today.  if residential schools were evil, what amount of hell have we put the ones today through?

&amp;#x200b;

however, there are major problems with having a toppled statue; if the man is in fact as evil as we say, and everything i said before is wrong (spoilers, it isn't), we need the statue to be powerful; toppled statues show defeat.  no, it must show power, because time and time again, we topple the statues of tyrants, only in 30 years time to put another tyrant on a statue, 100 years later to topple it down, the cycle repeats.  a tyrant never starts as a tyrant; they promise to do good for the people.  if we have no statues of tyrants, we will never remember the power we gave them, and how it all went wrong; thus, the horrible history can only repeat itself.  we need these statues to stand, to remind us of how low we fell that day, and to remind us to never do it again, because history textbooks are boring to the general public: statues are not.

&amp;#x200b;

but finally, i said before what hell have we put natives through now?  i'll tell you one thing, the entire statue pulling movement isn't about natives; it is about white people.  it is only an attempt to try to clean our own hands of the blood we and our ancestors have split.  and that is the sad truth, as long as people are tearing down statues, making donations to past incidents, we will never fix the ones of the present; we will never stop the current statue from going up, for we said they were good, yet the current future statues have done things even worse (denying them water, denying them their wishes of infrastructure \\[such as them begging for a pipeline, for one\\], denying them healthcare\\], and because no ,one cares for the now, these are statues that will be put up only for future generations to tear them down.  that is the sad truth about this country; the indigenous will never be equal to everyone else; we only care about removing the blood from our hands, not stitching up those that bleed.  tear down every statue, for the only pm's that had nothing to do with residential schools were steven harper and justin trudeau.  if you want to clean your hands, tear down those ones; maybe more concerned people will make real change some day.",liberals

&gt; under the conservative plan, by contrast, the amount you receive is exactly equal to the amount you pay. if you pay $100 in tax, $100 is deposited in your personal carbon savings account. if you pay $1,000, you get $1,000. you’re only getting back your own money, of course: the government wouldn’t actually be paying you to consume carbon. but neither would you have any incentive not to.

a good summary of the major difference between the two plans - and why the savings account proposed by the conservatives forces you to consume carbon in order to receive money (back).

the lack of any public statements from the traditional bastions of the labour movement is pretty striking. as far as i can tell the canadian labour congress hasn't put out a statement in support of the striking dockers, and neither has jagmeet singh, instead deputizing it to boulerice. seems everyone is in agreement that this is not the hill to die on.",liberals

jen's first claim is that an attack on a leader is not an attack on the people. well. that despends a lot on how you attack the leader. if one were to say 'trump's policies are not producing results\", then sure. there's no attack on the people who voted for him, just that he's not getting the job done. however, if they say \"trump is a terrible person as everyone knows and his platform is full of racism and appeals to scumbags\"... well yeah you kind of are dragging the voter into it. 

so lets look at her article and see whether or not the voters themselves were dragged in. to quote:

\\&gt; ***dear alberta conservatives:***

hmmmm. kinda feels like she might be dragging the voters into it here. 

\\&gt;***now that u.s. president joe biden has*** [***followed through***](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/biden-keystone-xl-permit-revoke-inauguration-1.5880268) ***on his promise to cancel the keystone xl permit, i have to ask you all a simple question: how is this working?*** 

so, now that someone else has done something, don't you feel like failures for electing someone else? yeah - no judgement there. 

\\&gt;***i get the appeal of that campaign, the lure of nostalgia that it evoked. it was a tempting fantasy,*** 

\"i understand why you were so stupid... \"... ok well that's enough of that. it's pretty obvious she was attacking the people as much as the leader. 

she then goes on in this new article to say that albertans can bow to the will of others - or act like babies in which case she and those like her will squash them.  (but she can't imagine why people might take that personally). 

here's the thing. it's clearly marked as an opinion piece. this is her opinion. fair enough - those who made death threats and the like should be ashamed. free speech isn't free only when we approve of it. 

but - its' this kind of derisive, divisive, passive aggressive disdain and bigotry towards others that creates the divisions and polerizaitons we've seen in the states. the dem's are famous for it and it's been a poor tactic. 

i mean - it works. it appeals to the base, her readers will love it. and their disdain for others not of their tribe will grow. 

but it's a great harm to our country and out future. 

and i suspect she knows that - but doesn't care. it's an easy way to be a popular writer in a time when jobs are hard to come by. 

so it's irritating when she pretends she just can\"t for the life of her understand why these poor deluded addle-brained albertans would be so unfair as to dislike her 'honest\" opinion.",conservatives

they then tried to narrow the search by saying foip requests done by this person between these dates...and that is illegal because they could have been doing other investigations that required foip and there really isn't a reason to know those.

the foip request probably reads as  \"could we please get the documents you sent to global news about cost estimates for relocation of service from vegreville to edmonton.\"  which sounds innocent enough and shouldn't be fired over...and as far as we can tell the issuer said no (and returned 0 documents even though we can be sure the document did get issued to the reporter) that's not a request we can do and it died there.  the scandal is now over if they should have even asked the question.

i do think your concerns are valid and there is a good reason why the rules are in place (which the article does cover)...but the situation you are describing isn't what actually happened.  i can see the mix up though the easy way to interpret ask about identity of the requester is you cant know who asked for it.  however in this case they know who did it but they can't ask about other work they have requested.

&gt;but it is against the rules to ask about the identity of the requester. and yet, e-mail records obtained by last week by global news — records obtained, ironically, through a separate access-to-information request — show that department staff searched by the name of the journalist who had published the 2017 story contradicting mccallum’s claims and searched by the name of the organization that published the article.

i've worked those throwing boxes jobs around as well and the rules get broken and bent there as well.  the big one off the top of my head are the rules around dumpster diving after work.  or even what to do with objects that arrive broken.",liberals

the bloc can be swayed, but not as easily as the ndp. today's liberals and ndp aren't all that different in priorities--the liberals are more market-oriented and gradualist, but broadly speaking their end goals doesn't conflict much. nor are trudeau and freeland shy about spending big, so all they really have to do is add a few extra goodies for the ndp to accept it and say to their supporters \"we pressured the liberals to deliver on this!\" 

i get the sense that trudeau wants to go down as a transformational pm like his father, and not a managerial one like harper, martin, and chretien. how transformational he's really been is up to debate, but based on the most recent budget i really get the impression that the liberals want to spend the next few years on \"nation building\" programs, sort of like trudeau the elder.

the bloc is not naturally inclined to this kind of politics. they're social democrats, sure, but their main priority is quebec. childcare for example, they couldn't care less about, as quebec already has it. on other matters, their first instinct is to say \"give quebec more money and let us handle it\", which is a stance much more similar to conservative premiers than a liberal prime minister.

also, it's not lost on either party that, in quebec, the liberals and the bloc are the main rivals. while most voters may not care about this sort of thing, collaborating with the main rivals would cause a lot of tensions in the lpc's quebec caucus. close collaboration between the liberals and the bloc ultimately hurts the bloc in quebec, if they're seen as playing second fiddle. likewise it hurts the liberals in the rest of canada, as such an arrangement would no doubt result in more concessions to quebec demands. there's a sense in the rest of canada, especially the west (where the lpc doesn't have much to lose to be fair) but also ontario, that liberals always kowtow to quebec's demands, and a lot of english boomers often have resentment for quebec's often elevated status in federal politics.

all this is to say, while the bloc also *technically* holds the balance of power, in reality they'd have a really hard time working with the liberals. and thus the ndp (a fourth party remember) has quite a bit of power in this parliament.",liberals

so show them to me. 

&gt;the bank is saying inflation is here. the question is whether they can control it.

it's not a question. they absolutely can, as i have already explained.

&gt;what happens in canada when we need to reign in spending? it happened before under chrétien/martin. but it’s different this time? 

it's not the 90's anymore. the world credit/financial landscape is vastly different now. inerest rates will be low and borrowing plentiful for the foreseeable future. 

martin and chrétien are also [neoliberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoliberalism), ideologically opposed to expansive social programs.

by the way, government spending to gdp is still lower than it was under mulroney. (17.1% and 14.9%, respectively.)

&gt;we are not the usa, which currency is world reserve currency. our dollar follow the oil prices.

irrelevant.

i'm a criminal defence lawyer. every sentence they posted is *objectively* correct.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;for these kinds of cases an accusation is all the evidence that is needed to bring a charge. 

correct. the allegation of the complainant, if believed by the police, certainly constitutes reasonable grounds to believe an offence has been committed (which is the legal standard for a warrantless arrest). 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; doesn’t need to be any additional evidence

correct. you can have reasonable grounds based on a single witness' uncorroborated statement. for that matter, the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness is sufficient for a *conviction*, let alone an arrest.

&gt;also the charge is brought before evidence is reviewed, so a charge does not mean there is enough evidence.

correct. police lay charges in ontario; they are screened by the crown afterwards to determine if there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and the prosecution is otherwise in the public interest (if the crown is not satisfied on both of those points, they are obliged to withdraw the charge). 

...

&gt;police conduct a thorough investigation before laying charges,

yeah. they ask the complainant questions. 

&gt;also, the opposite is really true: police in canada have a real problem with presumptively disbelieving sexual assault complainants and refusing to lay charges based on bs reasons.

your own source demonstrates that only a small minority of sex assault allegations are determined by police to be unfounded. anyway, what \"police in canada\" do in the aggregate is of little relevance to the merits of a *particular* case. particularly when we're talking about something that happened *after* the time period in question and *after* the above report was released (meaning it is something the police are aware of).",liberals

looking to flip to lpc from ndp - st. john's east

looking to flip cpc from lpc - miramichi, saint john, west nova.

what i think have chances of flipping but will be really tight races - cumberland-colchester, sydney, and fredericton.

only one i would change now is the gap in sydney has widened a bit more - but cpc also usually performs better then people expect so i would say its probably closer to a 1% difference.  theres also a lot of noticeable grumbling in the area about the liberals in cape breton region - lots of people not too happy with the two new lpc members for cape breton / sydney (battiste and kelloway) - lots of \"they are just not the same as their predecessors\" but that's also just maritime talk so again, could be either way.

miramichi has a lot of shy tories because of its anglo/franco mix - it says its leaning lpc but i have some doubts when talking to people with family in that area in person from work - it was also big cpc lead for a long time.

saint john has mel norton running for the cpc - he is a huge hitter for the area, and literally won the mayor of saint john with a 100% record (literally won every riding) and almost became leader of the nb con's only getting beat by higgs by a handful of votes in the 3rd round.  i think that will come into play a lot for the area.

definitely some ridings to watch closely there i think.",liberals

why? 

&gt; there is clearly a great divergence of views on which approach that should be

first, i think it’s worth noting that we didn’t actually know what the liberals’ approach would be until like midway through the campaign. they were the last major party to release their platform, which is sort of an odd thing to do if you’re the governing party calling a snap election because you ostensibly need a strong mandate to enact your bold vision or whatever. if that’s the case, one would think you’d have that bold vision ready on day one of the campaign. y’know, *the campaign we’re supposedly having because you need a mandate for your bold vision*.

anyway, the liberals’ approach is not so much an “approach” as it is a [a clientelist collage of microtargetted promises](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/federal-election-2021-the-liberal-platform-or-carpa-diem/) that are unified only by being bound together between the same cover pages. i’ve certainly not seen any proposals that couldn’t have been accomplished sans election.",liberals

worse, the population of people who had covid naturally, and the population who have received the vaccine, almost certainly overlap to one degree or another. if we suppose that 50% of the us population has had a natural covid-19 illness, and thus is immune, then by chance you could vaccinate the other half and have successfully made everyone immune, achieving herd immunity. but its much more likely that if you were to vaccinate half the population, you'd be catching some preposition of the already immune population. the only number we can be certain of, is the number of vaccinations given.",conservatives

so the wildrose party isn't \"making a comeback.\" some folks just stole their branding, and it's not going to work.

a lot of folks outside of alberta (and a shameful number inside alberta) didn't have the context of the wrp's rise to power, which was facilitated by a considerable number of people jumping over from the alberta progressive conservatives. the wildrose party predates that quasi floor-crossing, but they may as well have been born at that very moment because, for all intents and purposes, they were completely irrelevant beforehand. those floor-crossers brought resources and clout with them, and postmedia, who at that time and to present day, own every single major print media outlet in the province, decided that the wrp was their horse to back, and they shamelessly and relentlessly promoted the wrp, and it saw the wrp come very close to winning in two consecutive elections before the pcs folded after kenney parachuted into the leadership position.

the wildrose independence party has *nothing* on that level. they do not have members with clout. they do not have the backing of post media (who, in case you have any doubts, would never support separation of any form because it would be an absolute nightmare for their business in that area going forward.) and unlike the original wrp, their core policy pillar is *wildly* unpopular in alberta. barring big ticket intervention by a private third party, the wrip is dead in the water.",conservatives

so, if i’m reading this correctly, the  amendment failed because it did not pass by majority in each individual province.

i won't comment on the veracity of these stats, but do keep in mind that you're comparing a relative higher-proportion of non-monogamy in 5% of men relative to a reference population of 95% of men (rough numbers). but if you factor in that gay men are such a slim minority of all men, in absolute terms (i.e., number of high-risk samples) it's not a large number of risky samples and its statistical impact is minimal (safety is not compromised as these are indeed screened in statistical groupings to maximize risk/reward). and obviously, moving canada blood service to better screening questions (based on risk, like number of partners and whether you know your own and your partners' statuses, not simply based on sexuality) will do a better job at filtering out the high-risk donors in both gay and straight male populations, in addition to changes in blood screening. both straight and gay fuckbois will be filtered out. it's a win-win.",liberals

h1vwxdu,2021-06-15T05:54:03.000-07:00,"the more canadians find out about erin o'toole, the more unpopular he becomes this is almost all completely ahistorical. mulroney was insufficiently dedicated to reducing deficits, for sure. but he also contended with increasing interest rates over which he had no control. interest expense accounted for a huge percentage of the net increase in deficits.

as for chretien/martin, it's complicated. they did a great job with fiscal balance at the federal level. but they achieved this by unilaterally downloading expenses to provinces. this isn't really balancing the budget, it's just pushing the problem onto someone else's plate.

these downloads were the direct cause of things like the sale of the 407, cancellation of the eglinton subway and the other late '90s provincial austerity that was necessary to deal with the unilateral federal downloads.

so unless you support the austerity that resulted, giving martin/chretien an a requires you to ignore the link between their actions and the consequences.

giving harper an f on this file is the most ridiculous thing you wrote here.

harper's first budget was balanced, but ended up as a slight deficit because he had to make concessions to opposition parties to get the budget passed in a minority parliament. not ideal, but not outrageous.

subsequently, the global financial crisis hit canada just like every other advanced economy. you entirely omit mention of that *enormous* event and its consequences, as if harper inherited a booming economy that collapsed because of his decisions.

harper had nothing to do with causing this global crisis, and had no choice but to run enormous deficits to combat it. blaming him for these deficits is economically illiterate or intentionally misleading.",conservatives

both measures won't necessarily have an equal opposite impact on housing as well. hypothetically, if one measure reduces prices by 10% and another increases it by 1% while having a side effect of making ownership easier on people's monthly budget, then the benefits are there.

similarly, first-time home buyers incentives benefit people who are purchasing their first home but isn't available to people who want a secondary residence. this may put a positive pressure on housing costs, but it also tilts the scales more in the favour of new home-owners.

these types of measures aren't bad, we just need to ensure they're paired with other aggressive measures that deal with affordability, the half-million units targeted by the ndp is not a bad start. it's over 3x what the liberals have been promising. the liberal's number is likely much smaller than what is promised as well; according to [this](https://carleton.ca/cure/wp-content/uploads/cure-brief-12-rcfi-1.pdf) research from one of canada's main housing policy academics, at least 96% of the units coming from their main new construction program is housing that would have been built anyway which they’re taking credit for, but for-profit developers are using it since they get lower interest loans than they normally would.

oh, i’ll say this tho, this is legit, the first time in my life that i’ve ever been accused of being a conspiracy theorist because, no, i don’t have proof. 

but there’s one thing i do know and that’s people. additionally i know how government works at those levels both federally and provincially and i stand by what i said. if you don’t think it wasn’t kicked around, you’re naive. 

to raise the money they need to there are only so many ways to do it. 

1. the housing goose 
2. capital gains in the capital markets 
3. sales taxes 
4. income taxes 

the only one that’s truly a captive tax that is a catch all and “fair” would be to start plucking from #1. 

as far as 2 goes, i guess you could make a run at it but i can’t see that flying. 

3, is a regressive tax and with some provinces already hitting 15% i mean the europeans are doing 20% so i guess there’s precedent there tho an increase federally would punish the maritimes to the point where the liberals probably would lose a couple seats. 

4? i mean at what point does hitting the upper half of canadians become confiscatory? the upper 10% already pay nearly 55% of income taxes as it is, do you feel they should pay more across the board? 

no, housing could be structured quite progressively. especially with the amount of new immigrants set to arrive over the coming 4-7 years and them mostly being frozen out of the housing market as it exists today. their votes will count some day too. look at the makeup of source countries for canada: it’s china, india, pakistan, eritrea, nigeria and depending on the year afghanistan and syria all making up about 70% of the intake. not everyone from those countries are arriving with bags full of gold. they were sold the dream and they’ll want a piece too. except they’ll be arriving too late. 

today it’s luxury taxes, tommorow it’ll be income tax of the “wealthy”, next week it’ll be sales taxes and at some point, they’ll come for houses. 

why would a capital gains tax on housing not be fair? is it because it’s never been taxed before? think of the poor! the proceeds could be distributed amongst the low income to help them join the middle class and subsidize their down payment! what’s the problem with that? isn’t that the ndp way? take from the successful and give to the not?

also, you can’t take these policies in isolation. on the subject of foreign ownership, it’s worth noting that the ndp has so far been the most agressive party regarding foreign ownership and have called for the liberals to take a more aggressive approach after the they announced their 1% tax in the recent budget. provincially, they’re also the most agressive government on foreign ownership taxes.",liberals

the best thing o'toole could do at this point is state that a tory government will never allow any bill restricting reproductive rights to achieve royal assent, even if that means telling the governor general to refuse or delay assent. obviously, there will never be enough votes in parliament for any bill touching abortion, so it's a hypothetical red line, but at that point, the socons can choose to either remain in the cpc or hop on over to a party more in line with their views.",conservatives
