i would say there needs to be a much stronger focus on fiscal conservatism. i.e. balance the budget and stop spending money like drunken sailors. stop introducing new regulations on canadian businesses, stop raising taxes on everyone, etc. and get rid of policy proposals like ubi.

that and they would need to come out with a very strong platform on the housing file, which i think they have completely bungled. there is a significant housing crisis in this country and neither freeland nor trudeau mentioned it until the election. their platform is by far the weakest of the three. given that i think that is the biggest issue facing canadians specifically (climate change is a global problem), their silence is telling",liberals

mmmmm, not really. you have no right to go the movies, or drink at a bar, or a whole bunch of other things. you should look into our charter and understand the different between rights and privilege.

yeah, that makes sense. i already know of many small businesses don't want the liability that could come with being the source of an outbreak, so i can't imagine the government wants that... is this really that complicated?

&gt; don’t want to get a vaccine? fine, you can’t eat at a restaurant but you can make the sandwich, according to quebec.

yes, i also agree with you that there should be the same rules for the employees. though, (listen up here, this is important), this is where *actual* rights come into play. see, a person making a sandwich has a *right* to seek employment, so it would be difficult for the government to impose restrictions on how they do that. whereas you have no right to eat at a specific restaurant, only a privilege.

&gt; but there is a big difference between the government forcing you into a corner of society, and the collective might of a society.

ohhhhhhh, so now (according to you) they're *not* \"forcing\" anyone to take a safe, accessible vaccine to prevent yourself from catching a deadly, easily communicable disease like you originally said. now they're forcing people into a \"corner of society\".

harper is the biggest reason why the party cannot move forward. he's been out of office for a while yet he doesn't let go of the reins. he's terrified that charest would make the party progressive conservative again rather than double down on the reform-controlled leadership.

alberta supported bernier over scheer during the 2017 leadership race. so it's not about western cpc members automatically dismissing québécois or easterners - although some do. it's about them rejecting the progressive conservative way which the rest of the party and country wants. pcs and reformers simply don't belong in the same party.",conservatives

to use another analogy, imagine if in order to make sure that all government workers were displaying a neutral stance to gender identity, make-up was banned, as well as certain types of clothing (skirts, dresses, bras). clearly that ban affects one group (women) significantly more than another (men), while also making a specific decision that certain types of dress are neutral (pants).

i'm not going to seriously argue that quebec should stop having christmas be a statutory holiday, or end the practice of weekends (day of rest on saturday and sunday), or any of the other numerous ways quebec (and canada) still maintain christian traditions, but there's the nuance that what one person could see as \"neutral and non-religious\", is just because they grew up seeing it as non-religious.",liberals

i'm going to say my piece on this point in particular, and then leave the thread for others to continue this discussion.

the idea that bill 21 is a natural outcome of the quiet revolution is raised over and over again by defenders of bill 21. i find it a particularly specious kind of deflection, for a number of reasons, the most significant being the tacit equation of the all-powerful and institutionally embedded catholic church of the 1950s with the beliefs and actions of individual people in the 21st century. there is simply no comparison. 

rather, i see the quiet revolution as having reached its natural conclusion in the deconfessionalization of the quebec education system in the late 1990s, in which the schools were secularized and firmly organized on linguistic, rather than religious lines.

i see bill 21 in a different light, evolving not from the quiet revolution but rather from the night of october 30, 1995; not coming from real desire for state \"secularity\" (which was already in place for basically all purposes), or a desire to solve some kind of problem (there wasn't any), but rather just as a show of power -- an attempt by some parts of the quebecois nationalist movement to demonstrate their control over \"other\" parts of society (those connected to the defeat of october 30, 1995) by legislative means. 

i find that this way of looking at bill 21 explains a lot about its history -- it explains why it was this particular government (right-wingers plus ex-pequistes and bloquistes) that introduced it, why \"it applies equally to all religions\" arguments are used (this approach has been used against minority religions in quebec in the past), why the premier himself sought to exempt explicitly catholic symbols from the law, etc.",liberals

mainstream conservative media in canada is center-right and less sensationalist than in united states. i always found fox news to be really sensationalist, toxic and be really biased. most popular conservative sources tend to have much better reporting than american counterparts (national post, globe and mail). toronto/vancouver/edmonton sun tend to be less toxic than fox news but their reporting is not good. that's about it. there is more to the right sources like post millennial, which in my opinion is better than toronto sun but still worse than np. then there is alt-right source such as rebel news. they're actually not that popular but they are very \"interesting\" to left wing media. there is also canada/ontario proud which is not a media source. but sadly some conservatives on facebook use it as one. 

most of the media in canada is center-left. national observer, cbc, ctv news, global news, maclean's, toronto star, city news, etc. 

2. role of religion in the party

this is a complicated answer. the answer is a lot and very little. during leadership contests (primaries), religious organizations are a big and vital bloc. they tend to vote more in these contests than an average conservative. i believe most conservatives do not take part in leadership process. i personally don't even have party membership. hence, religious folk play a big role in choosing a leader in the party.  during an actual election, they play a very small role. leaders of the party tend to be more right wing during the leadership election, and shift more to the center during general election. 

3. red lines/deal breakers
traditionally
- being for higher/more taxes
- being against assimilation
- pushing for secularism (taking away tax free status of social religious organizations/institutions)
- electoral reform
- decentralization of federal government/provincial rights

currently

what if you apply that to news sources? let's say there's a truly even-handed media org, half the time they broadcast stories that make your party look good, and the other half of the time, stories that make them look bad. you're naturally going to be perceive them as biased against you, just like the restaurant that only delivers good service half the time: because that's how the human mind works.

now let's say there's an org that leans towards your views, so they broadcast stories that favour your party of choice about 80% of the time. (but the other 20% of the time, those stories will piss you off about four times as much) so now, you're going to perceive them as *neutral*! 

i think that's how you get things like the left thinks cbc is neutral but the right sees it as brutally biased against them; and then the right thinks the national post is neutral but the left sees it as brutally biased against them.
