well there's no need to discuss it further, it's not a criminal issue.

&amp;#x200b;

\\&gt;well that's untrue, isn't it. they cost medical resources, they support criminal gangs who definitely hurt people, they frequently commit crimes to pay for their addictions... do you need more? they absolutely hurt people.

sure, if you go into the nitty-gritty they are helping peddlers and hurting those who love them. still doesn't make it criminal and they shouldn't be punished for it when there are other options that actually help abusers with much less cost to taxpayers.

&amp;#x200b;

\\&gt;did you notice the massive uptick in hard drug use and overdoses since we legalized dope? yeah - where'd you think those dope dealers went?

&amp;#x200b;

give me a source that shows a correlation between overdoses increasing and legalizing cannabis. the reality is that you are wrong and you won't find such a source because there is no correlation between cannabis legalization and overdose death increasing. the only report that addresses this is this [report](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/26/12624) that states the legalization of cannabis has no statistically significant effect on overdose rates.

&amp;#x200b;

\\&gt;yeah - and their economy is a total train wreck with massive overspending and employers forcing part time work on employees just to get by. not really interested in what they've got to say. if a solution is going to bankrupt us then i'd rather just let the drug user's die. as you say, why should we care if they're mostly hurting themselves.

&amp;#x200b;

i referred to their decriminalization model, and you go on about their economy being a trainwreck; nice lol. their system actually works and there's solid evidence supporting it like the peer-reviewed paper i referenced in my prior comment. give me a reputable academic source stating otherwise. also, compassion is a great trait to have.

&amp;#x200b;

\\&gt;100 percent of it is the responsibility of the person who puts the drugs in their body. and - that is the only place we can make meaningful change as a result.  


still not always their fault. there are many factors that are uncontrollable that predispose people to enter a cycle of addiction. read [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2715956/). just because it's their fault, doesn't mean we shouldn't help them. first responders help people in car accidents, even if they're at fault. just because an abuser is responsible for their use, doesn't mean they should stop.

\\&gt;unless you hold a few degrees and a couple of decades of experience i'm really not prepared to buy that.

although i don't hold degrees specialized in this field, many people i've worked with in my lab and in the rehab clinic i used to volunteer at do. they all agree that the cacp recommendations or something similar to the model in portugal would be highly effective at combatting this issue. 

overall, i think it's much more important to go with the facts regarding this issue and not just personal speculation. i've stated only a few academic papers, sure, but there are a plethora of papers that are peer-reviewed and apolitical regarding decriminalization being a step in the right direction. we probably won't agree on this issue and that's fine. i always like having a discussion. decriminalization isn't the be-all and end-all for this crisis, but it's definitely a step that would save lives and money.",liberals

what? you just took my numbers and decided to associate them with other things. no, there's about a 20% margin or error for herd immunity, because there's no specific magic number, and we're dealing with a virus we're still learning about. the range comes from previous experience with viruses. edit: to clarify in comparison with your article, my numbers come from scientists who are being a bit more conservative and think 70% might not be enough. your article says 60-70%.

as for your article, it definitely brings up some interesting points. however, it seems to be talking about the us specifically. 

\"[youyang gu] said that reaching a herd-immunity threshold was looking unlikely because of factors such as vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants and the delayed arrival of vaccinations for children.\"

vaccine hesitancy has thus far not been shown to be a huge issue here, but it is a problem in the us. when talking about variants like the new \"delta,\" does it not reinforce the idea that the border closure should be maintained an extra month or two? let's say we open the borders and discover delta ignores most vaccines. then we're back at square one. if anything, keeping the border closed longer allows us to collect more data. as for vaccinations in children, i don't think that'll be a big issue. it was just announced yesterday that the novovax manufacturing plant in montreal is set to begin production in december, and with the orders of vaccines we already have, we'll have a surplus.

but it seems we're starting to argue towards a point that really doesn't matter. you brought up covid becoming endemic. to me an endemic virus and herd immunity is a \"to-may-to to-mah-to\" situation. i only want the border to remain closed so that by the time it does open, spread is slow and most of the population's \"immune.\" if covid becomes the new flu, fine. the point is, it won't be a death sentence. however, if we open the floodgates while people are still waiting to get their second vaccines, it's a clusterfuck waiting to happen.",liberals

a heavy market hand would be, ie, cancon. it's digging deep into the market to coerce changes in behaviour in both the suppliers and the consumers, for _purely ideological_, _nationalistic_ reasons.

another would be the crtc prohibition on too much foreign market ownership of wireless providers. that doesn't protect anyone in canada except the major incumbents; it's not as though foreign-owned wireless providers don't have to operate and maintain physical infrastructure, retail services, etc within canada. it's solely a market regulation for the benefit of robellus.

regarding your transit example: imagine if all roads were pay-per-use, and what impact that would have on vehicle occupancy and transit usage. market regulation and government subsidy ensures that _stroads_ and _highways_ remain cheap for provinces and municipalities to favour, even though they support _grossly inefficient_ city design and logistical transport. _if every road were tolled per-vehicle then users would be coerced to share the cost_.",conservatives

h4ivchk,2021-07-08T08:04:57.000-07:00,"the job of canada’s governor-general is merely symbolic – except when it’s not it's an elegant system. the queen and her vice-regal representatives in the commonwealth realms have two sets of powers; the royal prerogatives (such as dissolution, declarations of war, pardons, delaying or vetoing legislation, and so forth), and the reserve powers (dismissal of governments and the potential naming of replacement governments in the even of votes of non-confidence). the royal prerogatives are always exercised \"in council\", in other words, the queen's ministers advise the queen or her representative, whereas the reserve powers are governed strictly by convention, and in some cases by the gg alone.

a rather recent example of this was the 2017 bc election, where the bc liberals lost their majority but still held a plurality. however, the bc ndp struck up a confidence and supply agreement with the bc greens which gave them an effective majority of one seat. westminster conventions still give the incumbent government the first shot at forming a new government, so the bc liberals delivered the speech from the throne, a confidence vote, and lost.

christy clark went to the lieutenant governor to request dissolution and a new election, just weeks after the last election, but, and this is the key fact of this story, with the defeat in the legislature, clark was now a strictly caretaker premier. at this point, the provincial government is in an \"interregnum\" period, where the government's powers and its ability to advise the lg are strictly limited, so the lg was no longer bound by the premier's advise, and was now had full and clear authority to invoke the reserve powers. seeing as there had already been an election just a couple of weeks before, and seeing that another party had a confidence and supply agreement that guaranteed it a parliamentary majority on any and all confidence measures, the lg refused clark's advise and asked john horgan to form a new government. and the lg did this, as they say, \"without a rope\". in other words, other than seeking the advise of constitutional experts, the decision was purely her's and her's alone.

that is the true nature of the reserve powers, that the queen and all her representatives who exercise her powers, must always assure there is a government, and that that government must be able to enjoy the confidence. if another party or group of parties can reasonably guarantee that confidence, then the gg or lg will ask them to form a government, if not, then new elections will be called.",liberals

and, if toyota continues to be the only one investing on this technology, then i am sure it will also drop plans for hydrogen cars, why would an automaker invest on something else, when the rest of the industry is investing and moving to a completely different future? let's say, if toyota becomes the only one to bring cars and support such hydrogen infrastructure in canada in the future, it will completely go bankrupt, the production of hydrogen cars are very limited. toyota already knows that and it recently revealed it's first ever bev, the toyota bz suv, so i don't really see a future of hydrogen cars, toyota will continue to try make hydrogen cars a reality, but many automakers have tried to make success with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, but at the end, they failed because of the many flaws and hurdles hydrogen cars come with.

it's a simple denial of reality. any analysis of the politics behind the law show that it is. for example, in a soccer tournament in  gatineau, a referee abused his authority and banned a 9-year old girl from playing because she was wearing a hijab; the team bravely stood up for their teammate against this refereee and quebec's societal prejudice by refusing to play:

[https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-girl-9-banned-from-soccer-game-for-wearing-hijab-1.872219](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/quebec-girl-9-banned-from-soccer-game-for-wearing-hijab-1.872219)

every politician in quebec supported this discriminatory move, even the premier. only censure from international sporting organizations stopped quebec from making this policy.  it shows how entrenched islamophobia is in quebec,a nd that it is the main impetus behnd the law (with anti-semitism being a distant second).

\\&gt; religion just don't have it place either in politics, education or police and judiciary system.

indeed. this is why politicians, the police, employers, and courts must not have the power to target and punish the muslim women, jewish men, and sikh's for simply practicing their religion. religious practice is a matter for the individual to decide on, not government. government must not take the side of islamophobes and anti-semites in banning forms of religious expression they do not like.",liberals

basically, the judge involved wasn't going to overturn the law, but he gave the supreme court every argument in the book to rule that legault's use of the notwithstanding clause  is abusive, prejudicial, and beyond the intent of the people framing the constitution. this has been done before without the charter to challenge the abusive suppression of the religious rights of jahovah's witnesses during the 1940's and 50's. the full power of consitutuinal legal protections here has not been tested yet, so it's wise for the federal government to reserve action until this has fully played out in the courts.

a pertinent example is someone whose name i can't recall. she was elected in a montréal-era riding as a bloquiste but wanted to cross the floor and sit as a new democrat. this wasn't allowed, and she sat as an independent until the next general election when she ran under the ndp banner (and lost).",liberals

gjqch5i,2021-01-18T00:21:23.000-08:00,"opinion: anger is everywhere; are liberals paying attention? one of the things i seldom read in any coverage of the growing divide in the us is the causes. i think that divide exists in canada, as well, with the same causes.

one cause is economic. the globalism of production has screwed people in smaller urban centers as well as rural areas. it's sacrificed the sort of secure, lower level, blue collar manufacturing jobs which people held for generations in favour of high paying tech and 'knowledge' jobs which are largely only available to college and university grads and only in the big cities. automation has had a lot to do with this, as well.

the arrogance this has brought to these 'knowledge' workers has become more and more obvious over the years. the 'coastal elites' as the term is used in the us, disregard any opinion from those without degrees, and show scant interest in the problems of people in the 'flyover states'. for that matter, they show little interest in the problems of people in their own states unless they live in the major cities.

canada is no different. except here it's the \"laurentian elites' feeling they have the right, by moral and educational imperatives to rule the country. they regard politicians from outside central canada as virtual foreigners, as barbarians from the 'provinces' used in a derogatory term. certainly they felt that way about harper. 

they laugh at religion - unless it's the religion of an immigrant group, then they show the deepest of reverence.  they scream in fury if someone doesn't respect gay marriage, but bow and smile tolerantly if a newcomer says gay people should be imprisoned and attack anyone who dares to criticize them. they want total equality for women - not equality of opportunity but of outcomes. but if a newcomer group wants to wrap their women in cloaks, keep them at home and beat them if they dare to speak up, well, that's no big deal.

this hypocrisy, this small-mindedness and contempt for others has not gone unnoticed (except among the mainstream media which they control). and it's caused the kind of anger and blowback which got trump and his ilk elected in the us. and anyone who thinks that anger isn't present here and isn't just waiting for the right kind of populist politician to use it is kidding themselves. trump is a moron. ford is a big baby. but eventually someone with more brains and a harder attitude is going to take advantage of that anger. probably while the liberal elites are busy squabbling about how many transgender athletes must be included in every sports team...",liberals

so, if you *had* all-caucus consensus to prioritise this above everything else (which you do not), it would look like this.:

the senate next sits on monday, so suppose you could get first reading done then, along with a time allocation motion for second reading. second reading would then occur on wednesday, which is the last for sure scheduled day of senate sitting. six hours would have to be allocated to the bill on wednesday. imagining it passes, you would then need to let the committee havea day to study it and report back. you would then need to reconvene the senate for an extra day and somehow get through the report phase and third reading on the friday.

oh, except the bill hasn't even passed third reading in the commons yet, so it hasn't got to the senate, so they can't get started on any of this.

knock down the barriers for people who claim to be too busy. give additional incentives to everyone getting their 1st dose. advertise the leaders from every possible walk of life getting vaccinated, repeatedly. put more pressure on social media platforms to censor vaccine misinformation. start allowing fully vaccinated people into larger gatherings first. keep some limits in place where vulnerable contacts might occur with unvaccinated individuals. 

yes there will be cries of opposition. they will claim that a two-class society is upon us. the reality is that some folks just happen to be selflessly motivated (already vaccinated), while others require a personal advantage (hesitant). we should aim to satisfy both groups. a unified vaccine rollout will bring about a stronger country. we will all benefit from a higher percentage of vaccinated canadians. it costs more to get some people through the door, but so be it. let's make it happen.",liberals

&gt;i am not even sure how you restrict divorce.... force ppl to stay together, might lead to abuse and if they have kids even worse.

he isnt saying we should restrict divorce. rather encourage the culture to move to a place where divorce is rare, so is discouraged. for example, people will change their attitudes towards why we marrys. instead of the modern attitude towards marriage(which is a new development), we would go towards what worked. you dont get married solely for love, or as an act of love. you do it as a duty, and it is done for the community as a whole. so who you marry will be decided in a much more of a cautious way.

&gt;this sounds more of a pie in the sky religious exploit than freedom under our present system.

absolute freedom is a liberal value. neo liberals, and classical liberals are the ones who value freedom as the most important thing to ensure as a government. neo liberals less so, since they look at freedom as a way to comodify pleasure in order to grow the market, no matter what its consequences are in reality.

&amp;#x200b;

for example, neo liberalism has told women and men that their sexuality can have a price tag. something that was priceless, only reserved to those that were so special. has now turned into a commodity for sale. men dont value women the same way, women dont look at men the same way. its all messed up. but oh well, at least you have the freedom to sell the priceless, for a couple of dollars -\\_-",liberals

to quote george carlin, ‘think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.'

the more commonplace firearms are, the more stupid people will have them. 

the more hurdles people have to go through to have them, the less the only semi-interested people who think “having a gun would be cool” will bother.

right now, the requirements to even obtain a restricted firearm aren’t really all that difficult.

more guns don't = more death. all it takes is to look at

[gun deaths per capita](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/gun-deaths-firearms-americas-homicide/)

even if we take the most extreme example of the us, the number of firearms has drastically [increased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/), while the number of gun murder per capita has shrunken by half while suicides have taken a dip as well. 

&gt;[the gun murder and gun suicide rates in the u.s. are both lower today than in the mid-1970s. there were 4.6 gun murders per 100,000 people in 2017, far below the 7.2 per 100,000 people recorded in 1974. and the rate of gun suicides – 6.9 per 100,000 people in 2017 –  remained below the 7.7 per 100,000 measured in 1977.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/)

now i'm not saying to arm everyone, all i'm trying to point out is more guns ≠ more death. \"gun violence\" has more to do with economic and societal structure than the proliferation of them.

&gt;if you want to convince me to change my views, you have to convince me that your preferred policy is safer for canadians.

i'm not going to argue that it makes you safer, just as i'm going to argue it makes you less safe. either of those options are just not likely to happen. you'll be just as safe as you were 2 years, as you will be 2 years from now, statistically speaking. because obviously if you go back to the military or join a gang for some reason you will have a higher chance of dying by a gun that the average civilian.",liberals

which begs the question, what is all the hubbub, m8s?

&gt; when it comes to quebec, mr. trudeau is becoming less his father’s son with each passing day. he began his political career defending dad’s view of federalism. but he has increasingly moved to the middle when it comes to quebec’s autonomy. 

definitely.  but the theatre has changed.  in pet's day, quebec separatism was legit, to the point of terrorism.  today, it's not a factor at all, which allows jt to be very pragmatic, deciding which caq policy to ignore completely and which to somewhat pipe up about, while opponents scratch away at thin air.

&gt; the concept of secularism, which is a pillar of quebec nationhood, is mostly foreign to english canada’s political culture

because english canada is being bombarded daily with a lot more divisive news and opinion, perhaps?  to the point where the calmness and logic of state secularism is largely frowned upon by pundits and advocates, even though it's largely agreed upon by the general public? 

&gt; the debate over religious head coverings began in quebec after muslim immigrants from north african countries, many of whom had come to canada to escape what they saw as regressive social norms, pushed for a ban on the grounds of women’s equality.

*ding-ding.*  why is this take *rarely* seen in english canada?

edit:  his last point about muslim immigrants themselves in quebec supporting the ban is fairly important.

&gt;\"for me the hijab is a symbol of inferiority even if they [the muslim teachers] say they don't feel inferior or superior or equal to men. it's a symbol of inferiority and i insist on that point,\" said ferroudja mohand, who immigrated to quebec from algeria in 2011.

&gt; ensaf haidar, whose husband is the imprisoned saudi blogger raif badawi, said she is \"shocked\" when she sees quebec women dressed in muslim religious clothing given how they are treated in saudi arabia.

&gt;\"the hijab is not a good image for quebec,\" said haidar, who fled saudi arabia not long before her husband's arrest in 2012.

&gt;djaafar bouchilaoun, an algerian immigrant and father of two, told the court he considered the hijab an affront to his \"dignity as a man\" because it supposes men are sexual threats to women.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-21-court-case-quebec-religious-symbols-ban-1.5795610

we have to understand that quite a few muslim women (and men) themselves are fighting the requirement to wear the religiously-compelled garment.

the idea of secularism does indeed apply to everyone.  we have to stop pretending that it is in any way oppressive.  the idea of one gender compelling specific garments for another gender under the guise of religion is what's oppressive.

since further left leaning ideas are accepted to a higher degree than classical conservative ideas, and these people are shut down in conversations. this just forces these groups to congregate into smaller areas, where they just radicalize.

this is why its important to listen to those you disagree with, not demonize them. if you do that(shut them down, scream over them and demonize them) they adopt the attitude of  \"if i pay the price, i might as well do the crime\" going full on **\"i hate you all\"** mode on the world

this is why socially left leaning people, and centrists should listen to these folk and actually talk to them. sometimes they just want to be heard.

for example im a brown immigrant and im pro immigration. if these conservatives feel scared about immigration, im not going to be like \"you racist, n\\*zi, f\\*scist\". rather i will help them understand the benefits of immigration. that they dont realize that it actuall helps them.

this is the same with abortion debates, systemic racism debates, gender theory debates, etc...

apparantly, he was truly suffering from severe ptsd, so he was a peer of sorts. i'll reserve judgement on him for that reason. 

the person running the program knew he was convicted was convinced that he was falsely accused. that's way out of line, even if true. she's not the judge and jury here and he was dealing with women in the military who suffered ptsd. this is just awful.

i can't help but feel  that there is way more to this story than is being told, though.

on the political side, this program was started with funding in 2015 with funding from the true patroit foundation,  a veterans charity [founded by erin o'toole in 2009](https://alumni.dal.ca/building-a-better-world/erin-otoole/). they yanked part of the funding of the project when they found out about this in 2019. 

recall that in 2015, o'toole as minister of veteran's affairs was [under pressure from veterans groups](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/veterans-launch-anyone-but-conservatives-campaign-during-harper-stop/article25998438/) for cutting government pensions and health funding for disabled veterans. he met in secret with them to quiet them down; nobody knows what he promised. 

but he did have interviews where he discussed 'grass roots', non governmental ways of dealing with veterans in opposition to the veterans hospitals harper shut down. quote from an uiterview in the canadian legion magazine:

[https://legionmagazine.com/en/2015/07/q-a-with-minister-otoole/](https://legionmagazine.com/en/2015/07/q-a-with-minister-otoole/)

it's nice to have these we type military charities that do nothing but funnel money, but where is the accountability? who is responsible for checking the credentials of those running the programs they fund? perhaps there is a reason these old veterans hospitals offered systematic government care to veterans in the past. it's too important to leave to charity.",conservatives

as someone who falls into that age range i think the liberals are getting a lot of support from people like me for two reasons:

1. the liberals created an excellent osap program which ford absolutely decimated. as such there is a lot of anti-ford support out there in this age group which has moved to the party that has done a lot for students over the past few years and has the most likely chance of forming government, the liberals. people in my age group absolutely despise ford and are looking for whoever can replace him and his party.
2. there were many younger people who voted for ford to not only get wynne out but also because they *liked* ford in the first place. those people, after seeing the elimination of paid sick days, osap, and the minimum wage increase, have now soured on ford and as such have moved to the next best option.

in the end my age group is probably more angry with ford than other age groups. he implemented policy (such as eliminating the minimum wage increase, osap, ohip+) which disproportionately affected us and as such we are looking for any way to remove him and his party.",liberals

hccln6l,2021-09-10T05:32:45.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - friday, september 10, 2021 until it’s ndp eating urban cpc seats in bc.

i believe the ndp support is probably regionally distributed - they are relatively weak in atlantic canada and quebec, okay in ontario though strong in windsor/northern ontario and much stronger out in the west then they are in the east. bc is the ndp “stronghold” if you will - the province they get the highest proportion of seats out of.

it’s highly likely they can take nanaimo ladysmith from the greens, and there are both tory and liberal ridings in bc right now that can fall to the ndp there.

keep in mind horgan is quite popular, and the ndp has more recent governments in sask and alberta to point to legitimacy. sure, they won’t win a lot of seats in the prairies, but they can potentially damage the cpc a little there. 

but the real damage could happen in bc. the cpc have more seats to lose than the liberals who at most - even if they went below 30% - will lose 5 (they have six super safe seats).",liberals

i would say that they're about both.

all societies are racist, because humans are racist. fear of the other is baked into our evolution. however, in canada, quebec appears to be doing more than most to lean into those tendencies, rather than attempting to elevate themselves above them, so the criticism is valid.

&gt; at a separate news conference in ottawa, ndp leader jagmeet singh said it's a mistake to think systemic racism is isolated to one province or territory.

very true, as demonstrated by the reports on carding in nova scotia

&gt; \"to claim that protecting the french language is discriminatory or racist is ridiculous,\" said legault.

ok, that's a deflection, and hyperbole. how you protect them is what's racist or discriminatory, not the mere fact of protecting them. bill 21 is racist. 

&gt;. earlier this year, a quebec court found bill 21 violates the basic rights of religious minorities in the province, but those violations are permissible because of the constitution's notwithstanding clause.

blanchet:
- smooth and performative.  performs surprisingly well in english
- i laughed a few times at how unapologetically quebec-centric he is.  this isn’t an insult or a compliment.  he just makes it painfully clear he’s not interested in leading canada outside of furthering quebec’s interests.
- i noticed a very divisive reaction to his performance.  people either loved it or thought it was a disgrace.  

trudeau:
- seemed rattled and a bit defensive early on, particularly with singh.  he settled in after an hour and did better towards the end.  
- the format didn’t work well for him, and i think he was cut off too many times by the moderator.  he should have kept his answers tighter and punchier though, since he didn’t really afford himself the opportunity to land any big blows on o’toole.  
- i think he took the most damage on foreign policy (o’toole on afghanistan/china) and surprisingly indigenous affairs.
- he didn’t do badly, but i don’t think he really did enough to pull ahead in voting intentions.  

o’toole:
- did surprisingly well early on, seemed prepared for most of the debate.  
- i thought he flubbed his answer on climate change, seemed to trip up a bit when pushed on reducing targets.  
- managed to avoid damage through most of the debate but still landed enough shots to do well.  part of that was the moderator cutting off trudeau’s long-winded answers before he got to an o’toole critique. 
- his praying hand motion was distracting.  

paul:
- was surprised at some bombs she landed on trudeau early, specifically the feminism answer and the afghanistan topic.  
- her answer on inter-party conflict was really weak.  
- did better than i thought but lost me on a few responses (soon come)

singh:
- he is likeable but i don’t find his answers very substantive.  it’s a lot of platitudes and generalities without specific policies or numbers.  
- thought he landed a big shot on trudeau about indigenous kids.  
- i thought he would do better than he did overall.  didn’t seem super well prepared.",liberals

you mention the rich who don’t leave the country when they could for treatment, what if the treatment they needed was available privately at home? may that sway their opinion to get the treatment as they no longer have to address the added expenses of travel to get the healthcare they want? you’ve just created an industry right there. is it right to prevent someone from seeking that treatment if they want it and can afford it because it’s not fair that someone else can’t get that for free and can’t afford it themselves? should someone suffer because others can’t afford treatment for illnesses they may or may not have?

on the lobbying point i think we’re arguing over semantics. you mention seeking federal approval for a treatment is lobbying, and you’re absolutely correct but what’s the problem with that? if i have a treatment that could benefit many and make me money as a corporation, should i not persuade government to allow me to offer that treatment? what are your feelings about pfizer and moderna lobbying the government for emergency use waivers on their vaccines against covid? is that a bad thing? they’re making money and saving lives, a cost we all (or most of us) agree is correct. they didn’t do it out of the kindness of their heart but because there is a financial incentive to it.

one item you and i haven’t discussed is healthcare professionals, everyone keeps complaining about our healthcare professionals “leaving in droves” to the us for more money… what if we could keep that talent here? we can’t pay them more through the public sector, but if there were higher paying private jobs then maybe we wouldn’t lose so many nurses or doctors, hell we may even start to see an inflow.",conservatives

2. if the builder wants to sell to a particular client, that's their business, so long as it doesn't break any discrimination laws.

3. medium density is technically over 4 storeys but r1 is so strict it often has a 2 storey height limit and definitely no multi-family. the majority of residents want it that way, so short of disempowering municipalities, i don't see what you can do about that.

4. again, that's on the residents: if they want to be selfish, with everyone insisting that it's their way or the highway then naturally nothing will get done.

5. wealthy developers will still buy up everything they can find if you raise interest rates, or at least raise them to a level that most families can still (barely) afford. so long as you have a half-decent salary and have been working for a few years the bank will give you a mortgage. why wouldn't they when the government insures it? the bank loses nothing except potential interest if you default.

6. raise property taxes and leave primary residences exempt. that should suffice to keep the homeowning would-be landlords at bay. (might make an additional exception for people who are paying off a place for their kids.) if that isn't enough to keep wealthy investment groups from buying up huge swaths of property only to leave it empty while the value goes up, a simple vacancy law will fix that. you do have to enforce it though, which isn't really done on present green/brownfield sites where \"developers\" just keep renewing build permits but never actually build anything until they sell at a large profit years later.

7. people don't vote in municipal elections because it usually makes no difference: the people who could use the higher density housing are a tiny minority in wards with few rental units (that's most of them) and will be out-voted by the homeowners.

haldbed,2021-08-27T05:15:10.000-07:00,"canadian blood services wants to eliminate wait time to give blood for men who have sex with men okay. i'm gay, and my academic background is in statistics. let's talk about the blood ban and why it is more complicated than people think.

every test has a rate of false positives, and a rate of false negatives. as a result, the amount of hiv we should actually expect in the blood supply is the rate of false negatives of the screening test, scaled by the true positive rate in the incoming samples.

we can reduce this in two ways: reduce the rate of false negatives of the test, or reduce the rate of true positives in the samples we test.

men who have sex with men in canada are hiv positive at a rate between 3% and 24% depending on region and survey. the estimated general population prevalence is ~0.17%. this means that msm in canada have between ~20x and ~200x the prevalence of hiv compared to the general population. more worryingly, as of 2008 it was estimated that up to 28% of hiv positive msm in canada were unaware of their infection. ([more recent data](https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-canada) suggests this rate is now ~13%, but that is still uncomfortably high.)

so allowing msm to donate blood will inevitably have one of two results: either we will end up with hiv positive blood in the blood supply, or we will face significantly increased testing costs as the rate of positive donations increases. this is a statistical inevitability of allowing donation from a group with 20-200x the hiv prevalence of the background population.

now, again, i'm a gay man. keep that in mind for the following analogy: would you be comfortable allowing injection drug users to donate blood? i think the answer to that question is clearly a resounding \"no\". the question about allowing msm to donate is effectively the same one - slightly less severe prevalence, but still incredibly high - complicated by human rights issues.

it is a sad but evident fact that msm are afflicted by hiv at an absurdly high rate compared to the general population. it is not rational blood supply policy to allow donations from a group like that.

a lot of people use monogamous gay couples as the exemplar of why some donations should be allowed, but at a population level claimed monogamy is not a panacea. surveys regularly show a reasonable percentage of people break their sexual agreements with their partners, and only about half of those who have broken those agreements ever tell their partner about it. [a 2012 survey in the us put the rates at 20%/43% respectively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4096799/). this is why we continue to see plenty of transmission of hiv within \"monogamous\" couples. asking about sexual behaviour is likely to incur additional risk of contamination, unless the deferral criteria are so strict that they would amount to nearly a blanket deferral anyways.

the blood supply system is not a human rights exercise for donors. protecting recipients of blood from blood-supply-mediated infections is and should be the only priority in crafting these policies. for these reasons, the blood ban is rational, and should remain in place. i imagine this is why trudeau has not moved on it, despite his virtue signaling promises on the subject.",liberals

so what is causing this sudden conservative backtrack on the niqab? are they drawing the wrong conclusions from their 2015 and 2019 losses? are they panicking and somehow...linking niqab debates to the london terrorist event? further, should we stop debating the place of religion in our society, the issue of religious exceptionalism, etc, simply because there's bigots and extremists out there who want to harm minorities?  i don't think so.",conservatives
