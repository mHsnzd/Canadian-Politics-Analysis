also, it's not possible to be an independent voter if you believe falsified stereotypes about a party. for example, a large number of partisan liberal/ndp voters still believe that the cpc \"want to re-criminalize abortion and same-sex marriage.\" likewise, a large number of partisan conservative voters think the lpc and quebec are \"indiscriminately anti-oil\" and \"anti-alberta\"",conservatives

you're from nb so you might be familiar with how david coon has made the greens a serious third party by targetting his seat in fredericton very well, and building on it in other parts of the province. in this sense, the greens might have a future in provincial politics, especially smaller provinces. but on a nationwide level, they're competing with two other progressive parties. the ndp with nearly a century of base-building still struggles to keep its voters in the fold because it's hard to be taken seriously by enough people in enough parts of the country, something the liberals and tories can do by default. so it's really hard to see how the greens can become *something*",liberals

from nccid: 

&gt;march 9, 2021: a study published by the new england journal of medicine found the pfizer vaccine, vaccine, bnt162b2, to be effective in neutralizing both the p.1 and b.1.1.7 at equally high levels. even though the vaccine efficacy against the b.1.351 was effective, it was relatively lower (liu et al., 2021).

quote from article: 

&gt;a former chief medical officer of health for alberta says the province’s plan to ease covid-19 restrictions is “aggressive to the point of recklessness” and is setting the province up for a fourth wave.

&gt;“the timing is really aggressive and going to a third stage with 70 per cent (of the population vaccinated) on a single dose, in which basically the province is completely open, is irresponsible,” said dr. james talbot, who is the co-chair of the edmonton zone medical staff association’s covid-19 committee.“

and no, you're not shooting for a 'civic' nationalist argument, you're refering to an ethnic one. you want all people living in canada to be of the same ethnicity. (btw - in case you're one of those morons who think ethnicity is synonymous with race - it isn't. look it up if you need to. )

your first comments - \"oh my god 20 percent of people are durned forigners now! \"  yeah - they always were. right off the bat - dislike and intolerance for no actual reason - nothing has changed and as i've demonstrated it's a lie to suggest that past immigrant waves were of the same ethnicity. so you obviously had done no research into that and put little thought into it - you just don't like some of the current immigrants and you're trying to come up with some sort of argument to justify your position. 

good arguments happen when people consider an issue and then arrive at a conclusion. when you start with a conclusion first you run into problems. 

there are evidence based arguments out there about why a homogeneous-ethnicity state has advantages. there are certainly evidence based arguments as to why the rate of absorbtion of new immigrants is very very important. 

but you're not making those arguments, what your argument boils down to is \"immigrants r bad, m'kay' at least the ones you don't agree with. 

it has no place in canada, it is against our history and culture, and you might be happier in an authortarian state somewhere. you obviously don't believe in personal freedoms - you believe that people must agree with your cultural decisions or be repressed. and you call me liberal.",conservatives

[maybe this would clear things up?](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/nuke/)

the reason the taliban is resurgent is that the us never really had a plan other than throwing bombs out and killing a few folks. ask yourself this - the us has been occupying afghanistan for nearly two decades, how many senior members of their military leadership can speak one or more of the languages spoken in that country? obviously none, or nearly so. 

the us never took the war seriously, it was just a place to blow off armament to allow the purchase of more. they did not, and had no interest in, understanding the people or culture in the country. 'the taliban' is not just one organization - saying that \"the taliban is resurgent in afghanistan\" is like saying \"evangelical christians are resurgent in texas\". 

the us invaded, slaughtered some mainly defenseless soldiers, and then spent two decades randomly killing individual people who may or may not have been 'members' of 'the taliban' - often on exceptionally shaky evidence. go read a few articles about how people got put onto the official 'drone assassination' list. being a military-aged male and calling the wrong phone number could be all it took to get a hellfire sent at the car you were driving your grandmother to market in. 

it was a war that could not have been better calculated to drive extremism, that could not have had any outcome other than this one. i have nothing but symptathy for those poor afghanis raised in the occupied zones who believed that they'd have a chance at a better life. they've had to learn the lesson that so many others in the world did - you cannot trust the us.

in any case, imo the caucus shouldn't be allowed to remove the leader, for any party. possibly that's not what people refer to when they talk about trudeau being removed but, if it is, i think it would be very unfair to liberal voters. the leadership contest is decided by party members voting, not by mps, so party members should be the only ones who get to vote to remove the leader, if they chose to do so.

there's certainly some truth to this, sure, but remember that trudeau personally recruited freeland to run for him. had someone else than trudeau won the 2013 leadership race, that could've set a different tone for the party ideologically, and you might not have people in the mold of freeland at all.

i don't necessarily agree that caucus shouldn't have the ability to remove the leader, but afaik the liberal caucus does not have that power. when people talk about trudeau being dropped, its more that he could be pushed out through the inside like chretien, not through the caucus itself. as it sends, trudeau has a lot of power over caucus, and most caucus members probably view that trudeau's personal brand has thus far been pretty successful for them and see no need to be rid of him thus far.

you are way too emotionally invested in this.

i gave you a couple of examples of things that would have been reasonable comparisons, but ted cruz ain't it chief. 

you initial argument was that it's the same group defending trudeau and complaining about ted cruz. the issues aren't comparable so the grouping makes no sense. cruz's reaction was universally panned. it's like saying \"the same people who think marijuana should be legal also think murder is bad.\" technically it's true but it tells you nothing. sure, they're both legal issues, just not on the same level at all.

it gives us more worker protection, more tenant protection, better work conditions, etc.

the cnesst can still be overruled by the labour court, but this way employers have clear guidelines, there are standardized safety inspections, and workers have easy access to legal support in case of abuse. i don't think the common low approach where you have to suffer prejudice, suck it and then sue, which takes possibly years, is very effective. such legal procedures can be out of reach for the working class.

regardless, this is provincial jurisdiction, and dates from the colonization. good luck telling québécois they have to change all their laws to better align with anglo provinces. i don't see why anglo provinces would have a say in such matters, and the mere idea that their system is without a doubt be better than ours is condescending to no end.

this all perfectly aligns with canadian values and our system. the federal level puts bare minimum rules, work conditions, etc. it is up to provinces to do more if they want to, and add layers. for example, saskatchewan decided the federal 2 weeks vacations wasn't enough and made it a legal obligation to give 3 weeks. how is that different, except that we actually have an organization that enforces it and can react immediately as a mediator if there is an issue?

one thing i find interesting is the online space. there are so many mid-sized websites that we've never heard of. many of them make lots of money. people don't meet in person. people often don't even communicate on voice or video. i remember working for 2 years with some guy before learning he was black. not that it matters, but i legitimately had no idea who the person was and therefore if they were marginalized or not. i, for one, therefore treated him like anyone else with no subconscious bias. i imagine everyone else did too since he did not publicize this info. anyway,  i digress. my point is that women are hardly in this space in ownership positions. i have without exaggeration met dozens of owners of such sites, or businesses adjacent, such as managing ads, managing ad buying, managing content and so forth. of all these people, i have met 1 that was female. there are lots of women in this space too, but they are usually writers or make ads (not owners or founders). same with things like cryptocurrency. universally accessible to all equally. look at all the ico companies. all lead and created by men.

women don't even trade cryptocurrency (why???). you can find articles about this, but estimates say women represent 5% or so of crypto traders. there has been billions in wealth creation there. how can this be some form systemic sexism? sign up for an account, deposit some money, and away you go.

h2gso67,2021-06-20T06:44:17.000-07:00,"pope's lack of apology over church's role in residential schools was no surprise to vatican observers the conference of canadian catholic bishops **did not apologize**.  they made a statement of regret which is not an apology but more [a pathetic excuse](https://catholicvoices.ca/issues/indian-residential-schools/).

&gt;**catholic statements of regret on the former residential schools**  
&gt;  
&gt;the catholic community in canada has a decentralized structure. each diocesan bishop is autonomous in his diocese and, although relating to the canadian conference of catholic bishops, is not accountable to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;approximately 16 out of 70 catholic dioceses in canada were associated with the former indian residential schools, in addition to about three dozen out of over one hundred catholic religious communities. each diocese and religious community is corporately and legally responsible for its own actions. the catholic church as a whole in canada was not associated with the residential schools, nor was the canadian conference of catholic bishops.  
&gt;  
&gt;in a brief submitted to the royal commission on aboriginal peoples in november 1993, the canadian conference of catholic bishops acknowledged that “various types of abuse experienced at some residential schools have moved us to a profound examination of conscience as a church.” (saskatoon conference)  
&gt;  
&gt;already in 1991, canadian catholic bishops and the leaders of men’s and women’s religious communities had issued a statement that “we are sorry and deeply regret the pain, suffering and alienation that so many experienced” at the residential schools.  
&gt;  
&gt;there have been, and continue to be, numerous initiatives by catholic agencies and institutions in canada to help heal the sufferings of the aboriginal peoples. the process of healing and reconciliation is ongoing.

to date [the catholic church has refused to turn over their documents relating to the residential schools](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/trudeau-disappointed-catholic-church-residential-schools) they operated to the trc even though that would help the trc find the [3100](https://nctr.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aaa-hamilton-cemetery-final.pdf) \\- [6000](https://globalnews.ca/news/2027587/deaths-at-canadas-indian-residential-schools-need-more-study-commission/) remains of the children who died/were murdered under their care.

they have also [reneged on paying $29 million to healing programs for the indigenous peoples of canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/catholic-church-withholding-millions-from-victims-alleges-government-1.2542363).

the harper conservatives and harper himself were just as overtly bad and in many ways worse than today's cpc. the thing that's changed is that a significant amount of canadians — enough to keep them out of office — aren't on side with that anymore and have moved to become firmly against it. and we've seen over and over again (here and especially in the us) that this kind of conservatism isn't a path we want to keep going down. but they keep trying to play the same game.

remember, among other things, how the harper government muzzled climate scientists and brazenly launched hateful attacks on fellow citizens, stoking division and prejudice with things such as the barbaric cultural practices hotline, etc. for their own political gain. harper wasn't keeping the monsters in line, he was one of the monsters — it's just that at that point in our history a significant proportion of middle of the road canadians were happy to elect an antagonistic cruel person so long as he seemed quiet and in control.

stephen harper aligns himself with hungary's fascistic viktor orbán, stephen harper fought same-sex marriage, stephen harper would have marched us right into the iraq war, stephen harper called donald trump [\"less dangerous than bernie sanders\"](https://globalnews.ca/video/4542423/donald-trump-less-dangerous-than-bernie-sanders-harper/) and said [\"you can't find an anti-black or anti-jewish statement donald trump has ever made in his life\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/grkio2/stephen_harpers_power_dissolves/) (both quotes from 2018 when it should have been very evidently clear to any moral and responsible person that donald trump was an extremely hateful, awful man and a dangerous leader to his country, to canada, and to the world) and would have likely aligned canada with the trump government had he been in power.

rona ambrose would be an interesting choice, if the party could get their heads out of their asses and finally make a good choice in leader. i do not see them able to do that. none of them play well together, and right now the party has no leadership or direction.
a short term and narrow view to satisfy ones own selfish desires will never unit the party. but there is no one on the horizon who is offering a long term vision. 
certainly not o’toole. o’toole is in hiding, so as not to admit he has lost control. he is running a fear monger campaign telling canada about the boogey man in the closet. but the scary boogey man, even with all the mistakes made(and there were many!) was in office and brought canada through the past 20 months to re-emerge in a fairly strong position. you cannot paint him scary and evil when o’toole himself contributed nothing positive in helping to lead canada through the pandemic .
o’toole is allowing a group of his mp’s to form their own caucus. these people seem to just want to become a wedge to further damage the country.
fire them if they don’t get a vaccine shot when the overall public good calls for such a measure.
this group of anti-vaxers and disrupters need to show actual leadership as they were hired to do. not stomp there feet while melting down like an upset toddler.

this is an insane idea. 90% reduction in infection and shorter duration from a week to days dramatically reduces replication. full herd immunity would be much better, but harm reduction and lowering the r number helped keep the number of infections down and reduce the absolute rate of variants. once the kids can get the vaccine the rate of any flare ups would be much more controllable. r values are not purely influenced by biological immunity. combining vaccines with some form of test and trace can reduce it to a level where we have herd immunity.

&gt;anyone carrying the virus can allow a vector for mutation. vaccinated people still carry and transmit the virus. the post i was replying to said only unvaccinated can - that's categorically wrong and i wasn't concerned about the specifics beyond that.

it is a misinformation tactic. over stating real issues. you may not be doing it purposefully but you are doing it.

you may not be concerned with the specifics but it does give the wrong idea. a new variant can arise anywhere and full canadian vaccination won't change the fact russia, india, and many poorer have out of control sars outbreaks that will spawn variants. but we can do our best to keep it under control here. to keep canadian made variants from adding tot he problem. 

&gt;the waning is not understated according to the manufacturers and cdc who are all suggesting bi-annual boosters until covid isn't a threat any longer. not sure how you reconcile that.

you seem very invested on invalidating public health efforts. there isn't anything to reconcile.

boosters gives public health a chance to put out variant specific boosters. the delta variant has a mutation in the spike protein. it's different. and more effective at it's job getting into cells. it's only luck that it's still close enough for the first vaccines to still mostly work. because several regions around the globe either lack the resources or the will to contain covid it means variants are more likely. to stay ahead of it, we'll need to pick out the worst of the variants like the delta variant. as well as donating vaccines to the poorer areas.",conservatives

on handling the pandemic, i would say the government did \"adequate\".  it seems (to me) to be a stretch to say they nailed it.

rent to own isn’t really a stopgap. i have numerous friends in the uk who only ever afforded their own place because of it. it enables people who want a home but can’t quite save that downpayment yet of society to be able to lock in/work towards their own homes. effectively paying rent to help bring down the downpayment whilst you save.

here’s how it works and the liberals promise:

as for childcare, it’s important for you even if you have no children. the quebec plan results in 1.75$ to the government for every dollar spent (a net surplus) and raised gdp of the province by about 2%. this was the result of increasing workforce participation of women in younger age brackets, allowing them to work and generate taxes while also having money to spend on the economy. they saw about a 10% increase in workforce participation and quebec still has the highest rates in this age group in canada.
