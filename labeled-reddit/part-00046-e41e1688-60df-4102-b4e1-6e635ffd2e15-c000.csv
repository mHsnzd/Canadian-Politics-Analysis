the fact of the matter is, even though the previous government developed the current equalization formula, it did so under a different set of economic conditions. it was the responsibility of the new government, trudeau's government, to \"listen\" to \"calgarians\" and see that the current formula was no longer working. instead he extended it against the vocal protestation of \"calgarians\" and other albertans. it doesn't say much about the value of his ability to listen if he is in fact.

and to further that point, i'd say that the tenor of this visit has been tone deafness. on transit funding, on pipelines, on equalization and perhaps most callously on the senate. where he flat out said that the democratic will of 4+ million albertans is inferior to his own recently concocted process devoid of outside input. so even if he is listening, he's callously ignorant.",liberals

i don't think we are married to this notion.  however, that does not mean a politician is free from basic consistency.

if a politician changes their mind, then in my opinion they have an obligation to acknowledge that change and to explain their reasoning.  maybe facts have changed; maybe they've reconsidered earlier reasoning; maybe the candidate's own values have changed.  any of those explanations could be valid, but each says something different about the politician.

absent such an explanation, it is also very reasonable for us to conclude that a politician's change of view is cynical, superficial, or outright fraudulent.  it certainly allows us to question their commitment to their other currently-held opinions.

they wrote a formula that they thought was appropriate at the time. only a child would say that the economy is the same as it was then, why would we assume that all economic/financial programs should be unchanged. 

indeed there are specific intervals to review the program, and the liberals declined to make any changes. one would assume that since there are such intervals, the idea that it needs to change in response to changing conditions is you know, built in.

i think you're confusing the groups with the strongest opposition (and most likely to oppose immigration for bigoted reasons, veiled or not) with the majority of people, who's opposition is much more lukewarm and more practical. [for instance, for the past 5 years or so, the majority of canadians polled have shown an increased opposition to the trudeau government's proposal to increase immigration levels](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadians-favour-limiting-immigration-1.5177814). people over the age of 65, make up less than 30% of the population, but polls show opposition towards immigration increases in the high 50s or low 60s (indicting that opposition is more varied than just older home owners). 

&gt;again, not really. the push for less immigration is much much more connected to american immigration news, specifically trump and the racist xenophobia that came along with his rise to power. the poll actually notes this change.

you're ignoring the role failed housing policy in those countries had in strengthening populist movements and opposition towards immigration. there's a great [article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/16/home-ownership-is-the-wests-biggest-economic-policy-mistake) from the economist that goes over the role housing policy has played in increasing inequality, wage stagnation and intergenerational inequality across advanced economies, as well as the rise in political instability.  the article also cites a correlation between brexit and rising home prices.",liberals

&gt;	wrong. that was at first, but by now they have been they have now been monitored to an even higher statistical rigour of a regular flu vaccine simply becvause more people have now been immunized under controlled conditions than with any flu vaccine.



the conditions are not controlled. standard vaccine development trials require several years of follow up to determine durability and monitor long term results.

&gt;	gaslighting. you are basically saying we do not know how long the vaccine will last. that’s fine. but that has nothing to do with safety, which is what you are quetioning.

again, i’m not questioning safety. im pointing out how the “this is all normal, nothing to see here” messaging on covid-19 vaccine development is false. the moment everyone starts screaming that the vaccine was developed under totally standard parameters, a certain number of people are going to be suspicious.


accepting medical treatment is a matter of personal choice and conscience. i imagine a large part of that decision will be based on the perceived honesty, transparency, and integrity of the source. guess what? the government and its respective apparatuses have fallen on their face in this regard. which i’m guessing contributes to the fact that perfectly sane people are hesitant to adopt this treatment.",liberals

the issue, though, is that past governments who have 'brought forward' electoral reform have usually affixed strange conditions and requirements in order to pass the change. bc, for example, required in their first referendum a 60% supermajority and 60% of bc's electoral districts in favour. that result had 77/79 districts in favour and a 57.69% support from voters, but fell short of the assigned targets. 

arguably, a federal government who campaigned on electoral reform could unilaterally amend the canada elections act and that would be all that would be required...but most parties seem to fall on a mandate from a general election is not enough and a process for allowing citizens to voice an opinion is preferable. they don't have to do it that way, but they seem to want to.",conservatives

which references isbn 978-1-77255-070-2, which is a textbook i can't access.

regardless of that, if the federal government withheld all transfer payments to a province if said province didn't toe the line on an issue, it would end up in the supreme court with the approval of all the other provinces.  

i know my province just refused money from the federal government which was earmarked for mental health spending, because they felt there were too many strings attached to how the money was spent.  which brought me to the problem of the provinces throwing up roadblocks to affordable housing.",liberals

do diagnostics really have an elastic supply?  as i understand it, mri machines are still huge (physically), and they are enormous capital expenses, so i'm not sure that supply can expand very rapidly.

regardless, however, we need to be careful about the difference between private delivery and private payment.  flexible supply (including for non-essential-healthcare uses like materials research) suggests that private delivery is quite reasonable, but it doesn't mean that you paying $700 is better than the government paying it on your behalf.

we can then go on to argue about costs, but if the marginal cost of an mri truly is $700 while the government is paying less, then that suggests that the government is using sub-market prices to limit effective demand.  that is, the government is okay that people wait 12-18 months for mris (such that some fraction of people give up on trying to get one) in order to keep costs down.  

that's a not-outlandish argument to make, but governments ought to make that argument explicitly.  it doesn't do anybody any favours to hide the real policy debate from the political sphere.  t leads to euphemistic language like \"private innovation\" versus \"two-tier healthcare,\" bringing us right back to today's shallow politics.",conservatives

&gt; on vaccine mandates, on abortion, on health care, mr. o’toole has said things that at first sound difficult, controversial, or at least noteworthy, but which on closer examination turn out to mean nothing – nothing, that is, substantively different from liberal policy, the status quo, or both. liberal attempts to turn these into wedge issues have accordingly largely fizzled.

&gt;[…]

&gt; by the time the liberals shifted their focus to health care, they were already looking punched out. still, did they really think, in 2021, after so much talk of the perils of online misinformation, they could get away with posting a video of mr. o’toole saying he would allow provinces to contract with private, for-profit providers, while snipping out the bit about ensuring “universal access remains paramount”? 

&gt;again: private provision of services within a system of universal public insurance is common practice now – under the current, i.e. liberal government. all the liberal war room achieved by this ham-fisted gambit was to make themselves the issue, rather than their intended target.

&gt; mr. o’toole’s talent for double-talk may not make for much coherent policy. but as a survival tactic, its merits are undoubted. the point of a wedge issue is to force a party leader to choose between his base and the broader public. it takes some artful duplicity to wriggle out of this trap: to adopt a position of such bottomless vacuity, impenetrable yet suggestive, as to allow each group to take away from it what they prefer.

trudeau and morneau had nothing to do with it. the primary source states it was the cmhc that commissioned the study, and it is literally the role of the cmhc to look into this stuff. 

a federal agency that is responsible for housing doing studies is not indicative of any commitment to policy, studies being done are just studies being done.

&gt;which they of course denied until it was proven.

what did they deny that was proven otherwise exactly? 

they were asked if they were thinking of implementing a capital gains tax and they flat out said no, which is the truth.

a separate government organization (cmhc) commissioning studies is common place and will be done on a wide range of issues that the government could have zero interest in implementing.

imagine if our federal agencies didn't do any studies and made policy while being in the dark about all their options, that would be terrible, right?",liberals

and yeah it is kind of scary to get anywhere deep with my political views as think i risk offending someone in the process.  i fear that others may erroneously hold my political view as part of my identity and then come up with a bunch of stereotypes of me.  i avoid discussing it with friends and acquaintances because in my experience there is always that one person who comes out and says capitalism ruined society... blah blah and tries to convert me lol.  so  instead i just say i don't really know anything. i don't care, i'll figure out who i vote for when i got the poll. etc...

and then i come on reddit to places like /r/ontario and i'm like there's some good quality information here such as news updates,  photos,  some stats, and there's a guy that updates daily the case numbers.

however there is also a lot of hate and anger directed at the current elected official who consequently is the leader of the conservative party saying he's doing a poor job is prioritizing money over lives and care , but there is no standard to hold him to as the pandemic was a black swan event no elected official would have been adequately prepared for. 

and it's very much a people problem as well as government problem and you can't force people to do things, and their rights must be balanced. 

and then i look at vaccination rates around the world and canada is the highest. so i'm like where's the beef exactly? i mean is the job performance perfect? of course not, but then would anyone else be perfect? i doubt it.  the pandemic was uncharted waters after all. no country seemed to see it coming nor know/understand what was in store for the future! 

it seems to me it's a bunch of projections of frustrations born of individual idleness and the sucky situation of having to endure all the measures to help contain the pandemic (i don't like the measures, but i understand why many seem to be necessary), and  i feel like if i add anything to those conversations about what i think i'll be labeled some right wing nut off the bat and it makes me think maybe i'm crazy to be so against the grain.",conservatives

the article seems to suggest that historians concluded that the 500 people interned were arrested based on evidence, and the police had \"detailed dossiers\" about at least 100 of them. however it also says \"there are valid reasons to question the accuracy of the  rcmp’s conclusions\".

so i'm not sure how to interpret that.  maybe it means that the rcmp believed they had legitimate evidence on all 500 them, but it turned out to be wrong in some cases, or maybe it means they lacked evidence in some cases.  i'm not sure, so i didn't want to make the assertion that 100% of them were arrested based on actual evidence.

the main point is that the people interned weren't arrested simply for being italian-canadian, but because they (as individuals) were suspected of involvement in fascist organizations or fascist activities.  to me that seems like an important distinction.",liberals

&gt; “equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation”

alberta *chose* to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services with ridiculously lower taxation. they *chose* to let o&amp;g companies get away with immense short term profits at the expense of not covering any of the long term liabilities that alberta will struggle with for generations (orphaned wells, tailing ponds, spills etc etc etc). they *chose* to funnel royalties into general revenue instead of the heritage fund and then lied about it year in and year out. when lougheed left office, alberta had similar taxation to ontario, better public services, had all of its environmental liabilities covered and was *still* contributing *millions* every year to the heritage fund which would have been the size of [norway’s](https://www.nbim.no/) (10nok=$1.43cad.... for reference) by now, but for the conservative dynasty.

kenney and the rest of cabinet wrote a formula which was *designed* to hurt alberta come rain or shine. because they really didn’t give a shit about alberta and never did. by kenney’s own admission he was *never* in alberta until he started running for premier. he “lived out of a suitcase” in hotels across canada and around the world. he and toronto-raised son of an oil executive harper didn’t give a shit about alberta it was just a convenient launch pad for the political careers  of college dropouts.

incomes are **more important** but you’re just wrong about them.  that’s not how anything works. there’s a lot more ridiculous incomes and ridiculously wealthy people in a handful of neighborhoods in the gta, métro montréal, and greater vancouver than there are in all of alberta, let alone calgary. even in those stampede days you’re talking about...flames tickets were still cheaper than leafs tickets even though the flames were without a doubt the better team. what you spent during the stampede might have been eye popping to most canadians... but rich kids drop that in any given toronto weekend at a club with a rumour that drake might come through to.",liberals

contrary to what both mr. trudeau and his critics seem to believe, this is neither a new nor a radical idea. it has been the basis of american nationhood, for example, for more than two centuries. and it was very much the idea of our own founding fathers, who spoke often and movingly of the “political nation” they hoped to create.

indeed, and my favourite blogger marked america's independence day with a (much better) post on precisely this subject - why \\[the united states\\] isn't a nation (https://acoup.blog/2021/07/02/collections-my-country-isnt-a-nation/)

...

coyne's claim that the repeated recent invocation of the notwithstanding clause means the \"charter is fast becoming a dead letter\" and has \"...been rendered more or less inert\" isn't just alarmist, it's empirically false. to give just the easiest-to-demonstrate example, so far this year alone, on at least 18 separate occasions courts have struck down or refused to apply (provincial courts judges, who hear most trials, can determine that a law violates the *charter* but do not have the jurisdiction to strike it down) mandatory minimum sentences as violating section 12 of the *charter*. taking together the last few years, you can find *hundreds* of such decisions cited here: [https://mms.watch/](https://mms.watch/)

and of course courts routinely grant relief for other *charter* violations, such as unlawful searches (s. 8), unlawful arrests and detentions (s. 9), excessive use of force by police (s. 7), and violations of the right to counsel (s. 10).

i can assure that in criminal law, the *charter* is the furthest thing from a \"dead letter\", and there are people walking free today who, if not for the *charter*, would currently be in prison.

the increased use of the notwithstanding clause, particularly in the case of bill 21, is cause for grave concern. but no good is done with blatant falsehoods.",liberals

i like the benefits for prospective first time buyers. i really like the foreign ownership ban more then the additional tax (yes i know the cpc did that first). but most of all, the liberal plan to get their additional housing units build seems like it could work. we see the liberals tie funding to particular demands before - a carrot and stick model from the feds could very well give municipalities enough incentive to cut some of the red tape of nymbyism and get more units built! at the very least this seems like a more realistic scenario than the government trying to build these units itself, and based on the rate canada builds houses 1.4m over 4 years is about a 75% increase? (someone check my quick math, i have canada building 200k a year at baseline).

i’m really really impressed by this policy.

now, whether the liberals will deliver is another matter. they did deliver a majority of their 2015 promises, and i’m also willing to give them a bit of forgiveness given they got hit by covid literally at the start of their minority mandate, and that obviously took up a lot of energy and focus along with the umsca.

to have any credibility on housing, i think trudeau needs to clarify the following points:

1. would your government allow housing to become more affordable? 

2. what has changed to make housing a federal priority? 

3. what affordability targets would your goverment set? i think this should expressed as a multiple of median income.

theres also something called competitive arousal, where adding more people to a bidding process increases the final price significantly, so its not as if its a linear increase in price.  so its far above 8% higher house prices, even if you exclude this hidden money.

you're asking a very good question. many forms of taxes based on **citizenship** would not be *constitutional* under s.15 (equality rights) of the charter. 

however, the wording of the section is important:

&gt; 15 (1) every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic **origin**, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 
(emphasis mine)

while discrimination based on place or origin is prohibited, discrimination based on current place of residence is not if it is rationally connected to the goals of the legislation and not being used as a workaround in the name of prohibited discrimination (that leads to a deep dive into constitutional interpretive doctrine, which this is probably not the time for). someone who is a canadian citizen but who permanently lives abroad might equally face restrictions under \"foreign buyer\" restrictions.

perhaps more directly applicable to this situation is s.6 of the charter (mobility rights). 

this section grants a right that cannot be ignored by the notwithstanding clause. it allows all citizens and permanent residents to \"take up residence\" anywhere in canada.

however, there are two limits that are important here. this is a right to \"take up residence\", not a right to own, leave vacant or rent out property. 

second, s.6 has an explicit limitation:

&gt;(3) the rights specified in subsection (2) are subject to
&gt;(a) any laws or practices of general application in force in a province other than those that discriminate among persons primarily on the basis of province of present or previous residence; and
&gt;(b) any laws providing for reasonable residency requirements as a qualification for the receipt of publicly provided social services. 

in other words, the right to take up residence wherever you like can explicitly be limited by where you live now, so long as its a law of \"general application\" (e.g., it can't target a specific minority group. you can't say \"no chinese citizens\" but you can say \"only residents of these provinces\" have these protections). 

importantly, there is no right to buy or own property in the charter - an intermittent point of contention in canada. the closest we've got is a right against unreasonable search and seizure. this is an important feature in our charter, and its intentional exclusion is sometimes used as a rationale for not \"reading in\" property rights into other sections. all \"real\" property ultimately still belongs to the \"crown\" and can be retaken by the government at any time. that makes laws like this one difficult to oppose on constitutional grounds.",liberals

~~suppose you already have $40k, so you can maximize the utility of this tax shelter, and you're on the margins of homeownership so you're looking at putting 5% down (probably the most useful this will ever get). let's plug $50k down payment + $750k home into cmhc's stress test calculator. at 1.5% 25y mortgage, you start to pass the stress test around $125k/year income. in ontario, you're probably in the 43% tax bracket.~~

~~so what do you do with this $40k? if you're buying a property in the next 5 years, you can't afford to risk your down payment. so it goes into a savings account, generously let's say that earns 1.5%. that's $3k of interest over 5 years, or $1290 of tax you save. maybe that saves you your purchase's legal fees? but if you're looking at a $750k home, $1290 is nothing.~~ *~~nothing~~*~~.~~

~~suppose you take more risk than you probably should and invest this in the stock market, expecting to earn 7%/year (with the risk that when you need it, maybe the markets have gone down by 30%). that's $14k of gains. at the 50% capital gains inclusion rate this is $7k of income, which in the 43% tax bracket is $3010. again, for someone buying a $750k home, it's really not that much.~~

~~if you think about parts of the country where housing prices are lower, incomes are likely lower too - so your tax bracket will be reduced as well, and this subsidy is even less meaningful. i really can't figure out who this was intended to help...but it's not doing much.~~

the only way this could be rescued is if they were to make contributions to this new savings account tax-deductible, and tax-free on withdrawal for your first home. then at a 43% marginal rate, you're getting a $17.2k subsidy. that's not small, but if they meant that, they probably wouldn't have called it a \"tax-free home savings account\", they would have called it a \"registered home buyer savings plan\".

i really don't understand why someone doesn't just propose making 50% of rent tax deductible if you live in a household that doesn't own a home. this would *actually* make a difference.

edit: their backgrounder talks about \"tax-free in, tax-free out\" and \"set aside 100% of every dollar they earn up to $40k\", which makes it sounds like you do indeed get a deduction. that makes it a decent, medium-sized thing.",liberals

when you purchase a home with less than a 20% deposit banks won't lend you a mortgage (they're often prohibited). however, getting a secondary insurer makes that prohibition ineffective. so cmhc (and other private alternatives) will insure the 1-15% down payment you are missing below 20%.

however, the amount you pay to cmhc to do so, which gets added to your mortgage, is significant. if you are trying to buy a $600k home at 5% down your cmhc fee is over $22,500. so it becomes effectively a tax on people who can't save the full down payment (who are deemed less capable of supporting the mortgage if things go south). in an era where rents are often not far below mortgages, it can make it incredibly hard to save a down payment to avoid the cmhc fee if you aren't making big $$$.",liberals

you can argue about how trustworthy they are here all you like, and i think that's a fair argument. but the carrot and stick method to induce new builds and overcome nymbyism should increase supply - everytime people talk about housing they say its a municipal issue, well, this tries to tackle that.

i *especially* like the rent to own scheme as well as the tax credits to induce people adding a second unit (a rentable property) in their homes. i think that rent to own is a means for a lot of people who could otherwise never save up enough to get into home ownership, and the tax credit to induce the creation of additional units in people's property will increase housing supply (possibly marginally, but we really need more supply).

yet had passed, and the only reason they took so long is because trudeau refused to work with the ndp who offered to help pass it quicker. canada would have banned conversion therapy if not for trudeau.

&gt;the budget barely squeaked by at the last minute

you mean a year and the last minute right? again, there was no budget the year before so you cannot pretend like that mattered to the lpc.

&gt;how on earth does that look functional?

i never said it wasn't, yet all the disfunction is because of lpc decisions it seems. do people honestly think that others can't see past these very blatant, and honestly flimsy, excuses the lpc is putting out? and honestly, the lpc treating canadians like idiots by giving these horrible excuses that everyone can see through is turning some people off them. well that and defending people in the party that sexually assault others.",liberals

finally one of the issues is that the canadian housing market is a speculative bubble. even having public notices that say \"we are planning on reducing housing prices by 40% over the next 5 years\" would lower house prices due to people leaving the market.

my thing is, i'd rather fall short of lofty targets and still do okay, than fall short of okay targets and do poorly. government performance will be judged in proportion to their promises, and the liberals with their loftier targets have higher expectations and therefore more incentive to do more.

i find myself agreeing with the cpc talking point that canada alone can't solve the climate crisis. obviously we can't, but no country can do it on their own, it's why we have international targets. that's my other problem with the cpc climate platform, they want canada to turn our backs on internationally agreed-upon targets. well, you get a few more major countries like canada doing the same, and suddenly the whole thing is delegitimized and governments around the world just start doing whatever they want. to lead, one must follow.

the lender is required to use gross numbers, so your take home pay including a kickback doesn't allow an increase in the size of the mortgage.

take home pay with a deduction i's too dangerous a metric to use.  if i need to make 100k to get 2k for my mortgage and the other 700 deduction for my $2700 a month, i can't lose my job and find something at 90k without it hurting my pocketbook more.

if you're going to incentivize conversions, that's fine, but either the house is worth that much more cause it's already converted, or i'm a cash strapped first time homebuyer who can't afford to even do that.  not to mention that it's entirely up to residential zoning about whether that basement can be a legal rental anyway.

what levers does the federal government exclusively have at their disposal?  it's all tax based.  whether it's getting a free loan on my rrsps as the hbp or them saying they'll make 40k tfsa just for first time homebuyers, they can only do universal things.  anything else around rezoning land depends on forces outside their control.

a tax cut puts the incentive towards homeowners who live in their home and earn income in canada.  it also acts as a cushion for when rates inevitably go up.  because they don't need to qualify to renew, they still get a bit more each month.",liberals

the issue of whether we \"treat it as a health issue or a crime issue\" is largely irrelevant. it's what politicians and activists say to distract from the issue. inevitably it will be both. the source of the drugs is a crime issue, the addicted are a health issue and both have overlaps. did you think that if you cut off the current drugs the illegal crime groups will just go home and won't find something worse to hook people on? 

and responsibility is a critical factor, not a \"blame game\".  if you don't understand where the responsibility lies you can not possibly craft an effective solution. you'll just waste money and lives. 

the report you link to is largely useless as a policy document of any type. it just says \"hey we should do something about addicts and we should go after criminals\", and links to other things that say the same. hell - i just said that.  and no - the police are of no more use planning drug treatment strategy than any random person on the streets. arresting someone for drug posession does not make them expert in drug addiction or the best solutions to address it any more than getting run over by a drunk driver makes you an expert on alcoholism. 

the problem is that this is more about politics and less about actually helping people for most of those involved including many of the advocates. the left doesn't want to hear anything that doesn't involve free drugs and won't tolerate any suggestion the addict has responsiblity at all.  the right tends to not want their tax dollars to pay for other people's bad choices and tend to think that because it's the user's responsibility to address their addiction that absolves them from having anything to do with the situation. 

and thus nothing significant gets done and the death tolls mount. 

what needs to happen is real experts on how to get people off drugs and what does and doesn't work need to be retained (and held accountable) for coming up with a treatment plan and support plan that works the best possible, which may involve multiple paths to sobriety and treatment as there isn't a one size fits all solution, and to reintegrate those who need it into useful society. 

that plan has to be detailed and well thought out with specific targets and funding. 

if people don't want to accept help and want to take illegal drugs - they're probably going to die. that's their choice as long as they were given options.",liberals

for years, experts have been practically screaming about how abstinence-only sex ed doesn’t work, mandatory minimums don’t work, the war on drugs isn’t working, welfare abuse is practically non-existent, drug testing welfare recipients is a waste of money and will cost infinitely more than it will save, climate change is happening and humans are *at minimum* causing it to be worse than it otherwise would be, flat taxes are regressive and only hurt low income workers, minimum wages help the entire workforce including those not making the minimum, etc. 


all things that conservative politicians have railed against using tried and true “common sense” rhetoric. mandatory minimums are just “common sense”; people won’t do crimes if they know there’s a harsh punishment. abstinence-only is just “common sense”; kids won’t get pregnant or have sti’s if they just ignore their most basic of human instincts. people on welfare would have jobs if they wanted them, just think of all the help wanted signs you see around; it’s just “common sense” that they’re abusing the system.


and the list goes on. you must assume i’m pretty fucking wet behind the ears to not have heard the rhetoric in this province over the past few decades. not to mention what spills over the southern border and out of the mouths of prosperity gospel party leaders like harper, scheer, manning, day, kenney, klein, et al for as long as i can remember. so, yes, one of us in this conversation needs to be better.",conservatives

i don't know about that - it's hard to imagine them voting against funding pregnancy centers for example. that doesn't reopen the 'abortion debate', and it's pretty hard to say 'i'm taking a firm stance against supporting pregnant women' ;) 

the 'not kill female fetus' rule is about the only one i can see that may 'reopen' any discussions and you might be right there. 

&gt; in fact, these proposals are unlikely to get unanimous support in the tory caucus either because some mps are so afraid of the media.

meh - same as above. there's only that one that's seriously contentious. harper cut funding for international aid for abortion and it was pretty much a nothing burger. 

&gt;the fact you think this is nothing to social conservatives 

pay attention, it's exhausting to have to explain things like you're a child. 

i did not say they were nothing to social conservatives. at all. i said they're not really social conservative ideas or even particularly conservative ones. there are lots of things which social conservatives might like which also appeal to other people. what she did (and it's very clever) is find a way to appeal to everyone on a sensitive issue. seriously - who doesn't think that women shouldn't be pressured or forced into abortions? who doesn't think pregnant women should have support? but obviously that means that if there's more support for pregnant women then fewer may choose to have an abortion because they feel they've got no other option. so - win win. sure it absolutely appeals to 'social' types but it also crosses the isle and appeals to a very large range of people. so even tho they like it it's not a 'social conservative' thing.

 sadly, within the party at least, this is not because of all the screw-ups he's made, it's because he's hurt their chances of getting re-elected. a lot of the mla's rode kenney's coat-tails into their jobs even though they would have struggled otherwise and have since shown themselves to be pretty useless in their own right. at this point, being associated with kenney is only hurting them more.

that said, the way alberta generally votes still gives the ucp under kenney and outside chance in 2023.

if kenney goes, the prevailing opinion is that as long as his successor doesn't suck as badly - and that same opinion is that they'll struggle to find a replacement who doesn't - the ucp have a fighting chance. between now and election day, the new leader can blame everything on kenney, do a major cabinet reshuffle, maybe back off on a few things that kenney dug in to, and then claim it was all kenney's fault and the short-lived memories of albertans will forgive and vote blue again.

the fly in that ointment is that the right may split again between ucp, abp, wri, etc and we'll see a repeat of 2015 where the moderate/left vote was united under the ndp and the right vote was (collectively) more but split between 2-3 parties.

right now, the abndp have gained a lot of support from kenney's failures - they're on target to out-raise the ucp in donations by 2:1 for the fourth straight quarter - that's a lot of pissed off albertans sending money to a non-conservative party.
