sometimes you just want a government that gets out of the way (the conservative pitch). with the covid crisis, climate change, and canada's aging population, this isn't one of those times: we need a more active government, and i think the trudeau government has done a decent job on covid (income support and vaccines), climate policy, dealing with trump (renegotiating nafta), and support for children and families (ccb).

politics is a combination of idealism and pragmatism. this is especially important in canada, where national unity is always an issue. the federal ndp, having never governed, seems to be lacking in pragmatism, unable to compromise even with the alberta ndp, and with their leader saying that if he met trump he would tell him, \"i think you should be impeached.\" the greens even more so.",liberals

what you need to understand is that a heat pump is actually moving heat from the outdoors to the heated space, instead of just burning fuel for warmth or directly converting electric power to heat as in a resistance heater. so a heat pump has a [coefficient of performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coefficient_of_performance), meaning it heats your home by some multiple of the power it consumes, usually 3 to 5, depending on a lot of factors.

it annoys me to no end that whenever there is an article like this posted to this sub, around half the comments just equivocate or say, \"we consume more because canada is cold\". never mind the fact that china is a lot colder than the parts of canada where the vast majority of us live, we've also done approximately nothing to insulate and heat our homes, because the cost of power is and always has been subsidized to the point that it's cheaper to consume more than it is to insulate or heat more efficiently. i'm not saying that's you, but it's a loud voice here, that we *have* to consume here, it's not our fault.",liberals

mr. angus focused his first criticism and the one for which he says the minister must resign, strangely, on the st anne's case. 

in this case, the minister's crime appears to be ordering an independent review of a compensation regime carried out by her ministry under a conservative minister.  obviously (at least to people who aren't charlie angus) if the concern is that a ministry withheld necessary evidence in such a hearing, it would be improper for the ministry to conduct a review of its own actions.

it appears that the independent review dr. bennett requested of the previous government's decision to withhold documents has born fruit, and 80+ people have been identified as requiring additional aid. and for this... she must resign? 

i suppose that makes sense to someone, but i was never a big kafka fan so i'm having trouble following that narrative.

then there's the decision to appeal the chrt case. the case is managed by the attorney general of canada (the department that brought the case) and the agc had to decide on whether to appeal. while many people disagree with this decision (i take no stand, not fully understanding the legal questions or precedent at issue) if he is looking for resignations, he ought to have called for the resignations of the attorneys general who have actually ordered their departments to fight the ngos who brought these compensation claims - the current agc, david lametti, and the former, jody wilson-raybould (funny how many people conveniently forget that she managed the defense of these claims during her tenure.) i suppose jwr took care of half of that problem herself.

finally, she's supposed to resign because her boss didn't show up for a meeting and went on vacation? if anything, that's on trudeau personally.

hfdaqm5,2021-10-04T02:44:36.000-07:00,"is the ppc racist? we need to stop thinking about racism as a binary. racism is a spectrum. it runs the gamut from kkk members discussing optimal skull shape of different races to stalwartly anti-racist. there may be different, even conflicting, racist ideologies (e.g. white supremacy and hoteps are both racist, but differ about who should be on top).  

most racist political movements include a mix of different people. within the ppc there is a group of white supremacists. there are also probably a bunch of anti-vaxxers for whom racism isn't a motivating force - they may even be anti-racist. however, they care sufficiently little about racism that they joined/backed a party whose initial backers and donors include members of pegida and the sons of odin and campaigned against \"extreme multiculturalism\" (which as far as i can tell involves allowing muslims in canada). 

the liberal party certainly includes some racist people too. somewhere i bet you could find some blonde couple who really wanted $10/day childcare so they could afford to repopulate canada with little baby aryans (trudeau's blackface incident probably sealed the deal for them). but the concentration of racists in the lpc, cpc, the bq and ndp is way way way lower than in the ppc. that doesn't necessarily mean that any of those parties are dominated by anti-racists either (maybe the ndp is). as a result, they may sometimes support policies that have racist consequences.

lab testing cannot catch all cases, especially new infections. what are the relative rates of new infections?

* 1 = the relative risk of a heterosexual, non-pwid male, as our reference.
* 94 = the relative risk of a gbmsm male.  
* 113 = the relative risk of a pwid (male or female person who injects drugs)

gbmsm are at significantly elevated risk of *new* infection. ones that can fall within the window period. 

if a blanked allowance on gbmsm donation is made, then risk to the blood pool will be elevated. people will be infected as a result of that decision.

people understand this we just think quebec's policies and cultural attitudes around this currently are an overreaction that leads to harm — an understandable overreaction given the history but still a harmful one.

there's no real risk of returning to \"the great darkness\" as you say from people wearing their cultural/religious clothing like singh does. that time is past, canadian society is very secular, and that clock isn't going to wind back to a place where quebec is suddenly under religious persecution again. it's a fear reaction rooted in historical trauma that is understandable but that isn't proportionate to the reality of our current circumstances. i understand why the fear is there, but it doesn't mean it is justified to impose prejudicial policy and foster these cultural attitudes which can be discriminatory and dangerous in their own way.

the area where the town was built has had prime wildfire conditions since before europeans ever saw the place, and was even long ago one of the hottest, driest places in the country during what we call summer. there are - and for the longest time have been - brush-fires all through that region (almost always caused from the frequent lightning). the difference here is that this time there was a town in the way, as the winds pushed (what was until then) a brush-fire toward it.

what people here are trying to argue is not unlike those who argue that \"climate change\" has increased the destruction of the santa ana winds in california. it is a flawed premise. the risk of fire was always this great, what has changed is that which humans built in the face of that risk.

pointing to one the absolutely hottest, driest places in canada as an example of \"climate change\" is nonsense. better to focus on the change that is occurring in more temperate regions, and that someday could look like the lytton/lillooet region if we don't do something about it.",liberals

\\- guelph: trailing the liberals among decided voters by roughly the same margin as in 2019 (40 lpc/25 gpc). the poll showed that paul's candidacy would boost the party's support by about 10 points over a generic green candidate, potentially enough to make the difference. 49 per cent of voters in the riding are willing to consider a vote for the party.

\\- paul has high name recognition in toronto centre. the greens' ceiling in toronto centre is also slightly higher than in guelph but have about as much support in toronto centre today as they did in the by-election.

\\- greens have roughly quadrupled their support in toronto–danforth and spadina–fort york.

guelph isn’t so shocking as that traditionally is a strong green area, but i’m very intrigued by the toronto area ridings. paul seems to be holding the \\~30% of votes she got in the by-election and over half the voters are open to voting green. quadrupling their support in two other downtown toronto ridings is something i wouldn’t have expected - that would put their support in the upper teens or even low 20s. that could cause big trouble for the ndp who are probably hoping to take back some of those ridings.",liberals

both of whom are incredibly angry at ford, but are being held back and let down by their ineffective leaders, both in 2018 (horwath blew it, and wynne was too arrogant not to tell her voters to stay the course and vote olp mpp's to hold doug accountable, knowing full well that that guy cannot be held accountable) and leading into this year (horwath continues to blow it, and the olp chose an uninspiring and compromised leader who will not be voted in on his own merits, but rather can only be the beneficiary of a revolt against doug).

the only reason doug even has a chance in 2022 is the vote split amongst the opposition, and the inability of either leader to ascend to being the standard bearer of anti-doug voters. it is mathematically clear that ontarians are sick of the pc's but are being let down by the ndp and olp's poor job in opposition; therefore, the election needs to be framed as majority or bust for doug, and both opposition parties need to be ready, willing and able to admit that neither of them can win on their own, and form a coalition.

even the expected maximum 2-year lifespan of a minority pc government would be too much time for the pc's to run roughshod over ontario, and not enough time for either opposition party leader to carve out an advantage for themselves.",liberals

i work with a few multi-generational immigrant families, and their old folks definitely contribute. even those who don't earn money offer support that allows their family to work longer, harder and more effectively to build real wealth. 

if grandma doesn't work outside the home, she damn sure takes care of childcare - meaning that the family's kids are raised by a loving relative instead of an overworked daycare worker that costs the family more per kid than a payment on a decent car. 

grandma/aunties also take care of cooking, which means that even when the family is super-busy, they rarely have to eat out. 

granddad certainly works. come out to abbotsford sometime during harvest, and you'll see big groups of mainly elderly punjabi men (with some women) picking all the foods that we eat around here. 

it's really only the old-folks of 'old stock canadians' that sit around and contribute nothing to the family and economy. immigrants don't come here to rest, they come here to build something for their children and families.",liberals

for the gun ban and buyback, it seems they did a simple calculation on paying each owner per gun, but forgot the cost of administration, security, storage, etc that exponentially raises the cost. i think this is why they received no bids when they put the buyback management out to tender. nobody could make the program work with the funds the government wants to make available.

for the regulation of checking centrally and getting an authorization number for each non-restricted firearm sale, the rcmp would have to significantly increase personnel, equipment and office space. as it is now, authorizations for handgun purchases can take from a week to three months to complete - and handgun purchases are a small fraction of firearm sales compared to long guns. those large infrastructure upgrades and ongoing operational cost increases are likely outside of the budget envelope of the rcmp who are facing a lot of other policing challenges and questions - and have a lot more to fix before tackling something new.

so, to review - little to no effectiveness, lots of cost. no mystery.",liberals
