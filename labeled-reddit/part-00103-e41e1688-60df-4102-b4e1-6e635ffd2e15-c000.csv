goxwxlg,2021-02-26T12:15:21.000-08:00,"liberal mp says some cabinet ministers ‘very supportive’ of basic income &gt; what happened to the liberal party?

we're a big-tent party, covering a wide range of people with an equally wide range of ideas. basic income is a compelling idea - it's simple, easy to understand, and seems to solve the long-standing problem of poverty (*) at one stroke. but economists who have taken a close look, like the recent [bc expert panel](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/), have concluded that it's not workable. within the liberal party, economists have a lot of influence, so i think basic income isn't going anywhere.

(*) [joseph heath](https://www.academia.edu/45006210/why_a_ubi_will_never_be_high_enough):

&gt; the simplicity of a ubi is, in part, an illusion, since these payments are only “universal” in the superficial sense that the government would be making a deposit to the account of every individual in the society. but as long as there is an income tax, or even a consumption tax, most citizens will be paying the money right back to the government. even if the ubi itself is untaxed, most people would have a tax bill that is higher than the ubi, which means that for them the ubi is functionally equivalent to a tax credit. and since income taxes would no doubt have to be raised with the introduction of a ubi, for most citizens the ubi payments would be a wash. the only region in which the payments make a difference is at the lower end of the income distribution, where the ubi payments are higher than the individual’s tax bill. since this is the region that is currently served by welfare programs (which would be abolished with the introduction of a ubi), ubi proposals are best regarded as a type of welfare reform.",liberals
goxygjc,2021-02-26T12:23:57.000-08:00,"liberals rhetorically support ndp pharmacare bill, then vote against it of course they did, it's not their bill. no government, whatever the party, would ever advance any major change in policy or fulfil a campaign pledge via an opposition bill. it simply never happens. most of the time governments don't even like private members bills from their own party.

it is always in the interest of the ruling party to maintain control over the legislative process, and if you think an ndp government would be different, you're deluding yourself. once in power, the number one priority of any party is to stay in power, and letting the opposition make laws or policy, even ones you agree with, threatens that.

edit: to be clear, i think this government does deserve a lot of criticism for not advancing on pharmacare. but using this bill to do so is just playing politics. something i expect from the cpc and the lpc, but i had hoped would be below the ndp. now i can only hope that this whole saga spurs the government to actually make some progress on pharmacare, but i fear it will have the opposite effect.",liberals

i can buy that there is a tradeoff - minority candidates are more attune to the minority populations' interests. but, to me that would signal they are less attune to the majority populations' interests. if so, it isn't obvious why they would be voted in. indeed, if this is the argument, it seems like a great reason why minorities ironically *shouldn't* be voted in. they would help a smaller number, but harm a greater number.

it wasn't until the tva debate that o'toole tripped over himself on gun regulations.  even then, he was the author of his own misfortune.  the lpc attacks on guns stuck because o'toole apparently contradicted his own platform (on banning/not banning 'assault weapons'), and that opened the door to question the party's sincerity on everything else.  

o'toole added yet more fuel to that fire with the quebec daycare exception, which wasn't present in the platform's costing.

if there was bad strategy in the platform, it was in the platform's existence as three or four different pitch decks glued together, filled with a scattershot of (mostly) small policies on just about every topic.  that seemed to leave candidates stuck defending policies they never even heard about, and it risked (risks) making the caucus discontent worse.",conservatives

personally i would suggest that the point of canada day is not so much to celebrate **pride in canada** as to strengthen the feeling of connection that we have with **other canadians as a community**. i think that's a vital part of public life - if you feel no connection to other canadians, why would you care at all about issues which do not affect you personally? why would you be willing to pay taxes to fund public services (like cerb, for example) that you don't personally benefit from?

to me, the covid crisis really demonstrates the importance of social solidarity.

joseph heath on [immigrants and the canadian nation-building project](http://induecourse.ca/canadian-exceptionalism/):

&gt; it is important to observe that the major cleavages within canadian society – those that threaten to tear the country apart – are between its “founding peoples,” the english, french and first nations. just today, in my canada day edition of the globe and mail, i see short interviews with all the provincial premiers, about their dreams and hopes for the future – all except the premier of quebec, who refused to participate. meanwhile, there is a “reoccupation” teepee in ottawa, to protest the canada 150 celebrations. and so it goes. does anyone seriously believe that the canada 200 celebrations will be any different? after all, we will still be standing on land stolen by the white man, montcalm will still have been defeated on the plains of abraham…
&gt;
&gt; immigrants, by contrast, arrive here fresh, with none of these axes to grind – and indeed, convincing them even to take an interest in these old conflicts is a challenge. as a result, immigrants have been doing a lot more to hold the country together in the past few decades than any of the founders. it may have been impolitic for jacques parizeau to blame the loss of the 1995 quebec referendum on “money and the ethnic vote,” but the allegation was certainly not false. “allophones” in quebec essentially voted along the same lines as anglophones – overwhelmingly in favour of staying in canada. if they had voted like francophones, quebec would have seceded. the fact that secession is now considered dead in quebec is almost entirely a consequence of subsequent immigration, not any sort of change of heart on the part of francophone quebecers. this is nation-building on a large-scale – canada has, in effect, overcome the secession threat by changing its own internal demographics.
&gt; 
&gt; or consider relations with first nations. it is important to recognize that the entire aboriginal population of canada adds up to less than five years worth of immigrants at the current rate of intake. immigration, in other words, is demographically overwhelming. convincing these immigrants to feel any sense of responsibility for injustices committed by british colonialists is, again, a significant challenge. telling them that canada is a “settler” society is likely to be met with blank stares. most immigrants, to the extent that they have thought about it, consider themselves victims of colonialism, not perpetrators. this creates an entirely new political reality, one that the “two-row wampum” model is poorly equipped to handle.
&gt;
&gt; immigrants have helped to build the canadian nation, not just by increasing our population. one of the major differences between immigrants and old-stock canadians is that the former tend to identify and owe allegiance to the central state, and are thus far less likely to have any sort of regional identity. when people immigrate, they think of themselves as moving to canada, not to western canada, or newfoundland, or ontario. they identify with the national symbols.
&gt; 
&gt; many young people fail to realize how weak canadian nationalism was even one or two generations back. i’m old enough to remember singing god save the queen, rather than o canada, in school. growing up in saskatoon in the 1970s, one saw very few canadian flags (there was significant resentment of the maple leaf, given that none of us had ever seen a maple tree – it grows only in eastern canada). it was only when i moved to toronto that i got used to seeing canadian flags all over the place. one of the first things i noticed was how often these flags were being displayed by immigrants.
&gt; 
&gt; the important point is that this has not happened by accident, it is all a consequence of a plan that was adopted, during the 1970s [in response to quebec separatism], to strengthen the federal government by cultivating a stronger sense of national identity, focused on ottawa, and on national symbols. it is therefore no surprise that there is a correlation between patriotism and support for immigration – immigrants have been the carrier class for much of the new patriotism that has been developing over the past three or four decades.",conservatives

however, as bad as the 2013 implosion was, burrill did even worse in 2017, losing 25% of the vote and becoming an urban only protest party.  in trying to course correct from the 2013 debacle, the nsndp essentially elected to cure the disease by killing the patient instead of staying the course with what got them 15 years of government or opposition results (1998 to 2013) but addressing the mistakes made in government.  that's fine if all you want to be is an urban hrm protest party with a ceiling of 5 seats, but you will never win an election with that approach.",liberals

everything you've said is irrelevant to your claim that carney's shift has made the problem worse. if you think the problem is as bad as you say it is, then carney made no difference. so which is it? are we already a banana republic in which case carney doesn't matter? or did we magically go from totally non-partisan appointments to partisan appointments this week.

this means this decision, and the government's response we see here, was going to be playing out against the backdrop of the trump administration, which i think most people here would recognize has been very unsupportive for canada in the face of chinese aggression. biden on the other hand seems to be more supportive, although time will tell, as well as more hawkish on the chinese situation. this puts the award in a different context for canada, so it wouldn't surprise me if it went ahead.

the situation when he was elected was extraordinarily bleak, but i do think his choice to push forward austerity against the people who made up most of his base was the biggest misstep. i’m very far from an ndp supporter, but i do express a sense of despair for him since he truly was stuck between a rock and a hard place, and neither move forward would’ve amounted to enough to keep the unions happy. “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” was the catalyst for his failure. 

the simplest explanation for why it’s still brought up as a slight against the ontario ndp is that it’s an easy target for the other parties. you can’t help but focus in on the failures of the only time the party gained power, with the messaging of “last time they were in power they did this, why would ontarians want that again?”. there’s a case to be made that the ndp of today wouldn’t ever try that again, but it’s the lasting memory of them in the minds of millions of ontarians of a certain age so they’ll evidently choose not to vote for that.",liberals

all of which is true-- the government *could* have appealed the ruling, although there's no real reason to think that the ruling would end up being different from what the quebec courts decided. at the end of the day, the uncomfortable fact is that people can suffer for an extremely long time before death ever becomes 'foreseeable' and there's no particular good argument for why those people should suffer.

as for high tories... does anyone still identify as high tory? especially here in canada. the reason for this is because high tories are anti-capitalists. but they are also anti-socialist. i believe they are essentially like old school liberals on economic policy. but on social policy they are pretty right wing. they are paternalistic but unlike modern liberals they also value personal responsibility. they care extremely about maintaining existing social institutions, culture, religion and social structure.",liberals

also, i assume that a lot of the issues “regular” canadians are dealing with aren’t faced by ottawa centre as much since a significant portion of people here are government workers and have had stable paycheques and/or coordinated the government response throughout the pandemic. i would imagine this means there’s a bit less desire for change when compared to other ridings. i think the main weak spot for the liberals in this riding would be housing given the way ottawa’s market has been the last 1.5 years though a lot of that has to do with city hall.

protectionist policies don’t kill innovation, they allow canadian companies to exist in the first place. 

the only “innovation” you’d see by getting rid of them is having our small market completely dominated by much bigger and powerful ones. 

what do you think us more likely; that bell starts expanding businesses into the us competing in their market, or that at&amp;t moves into canada and puts bell and rogers out of business completely?

this is an example of how in bed with the republicans the conservatives have become, that they would sacrifice canadian companies for american interests. 

&gt; the foreign companies became more and more competitive while american auto industry fell further and further behind 

america fell behind because the working conditions in asia were insane, and wouldn’t be tolerated over here. long hours, 6 day work weeks, and cheaper labour costs. 

america lost the lead in that industry because they were willing to open up that market to foreign competitors who don’t play by the same rules, and it’s the reason they put import costs on foreign vehicles, to protect american industries that would otherwise not be able to compete.

despite these protectionist policies the us is home to tesla, one of the most advanced car companies in the world, large due to us subsidies and investment, much like we could do here in canada if we were willing to put our tax dollars towards investing in our own economy.

maybe if we had similar protectionist policies canada could have its own auto industry making cars built specifically for canada and canadian conditions. hell, we could even make them electric, or have rules about foreigners only allowed to sell electric cars in canada. 

how’s that for innovation? supporting the canadian economy and incentivizing foreign and domestic innovation.

—-

actually, why don’t we do that? this random example sounds like a potentially great idea. 

- all foreign auto manufacturers would be forced to convert their factories into producing electric vehicles. 

- canadians could still produce gasoline engines through canadian companies, and thus have an economic advantage 

- foreign innovation slowly trickles in

- canadian auto manufacturers would have a better chance at competing in the electric market with a canadian built electric car, due to sale from the petroleum market and tax subsidies to get them started",conservatives

i also politely disagree with your understanding of ideology. it is counter to what has been observed and written in the scholarly literature so far.

ideologies do change. they are social constructs whose actors and their problems and solutions change over time. to claim that canadian conservatism has been static across time would be ahistorical and (with all due respect) ludicrous.

normative arguments can be made as to what *should* or *shouldn’t* change, but to assume the harper government’s style of conservatism as somehow a given would be ignorant of all previous canadian conservatism that came before.

finally, you make a lot of statements without specifying what you mean. it’s one thing to say that the conservatives are now too akin to other parties, but you still have to describe what policies and positions you mean specifically, then argue as to why this is more anomaly than otherwise.

the conservatives have (largely) been a centre-right, brokerage party for much of its existence. while again, there have certainly been changes within it, one pattern that remains the same is its appeal to those that are nonpartisan and or more centrist.

but what is the centre? societal values, priorities and perspectives change and therefore, so also does what voters consider to be moderate, and amenable positions on a subject.

if voters aren’t interested in your policy platform, among many other things, then it might not matter how consistent you are on such matters.",conservatives

recent inflation has some pretty clear causes related to supply chain issues and the general whiplash of the pandemic economic shock. using fiscal policy to reduce the price level might *work*, in the sense that it would reduce the economic statistic known as inflation, but it would do nothing to actually solve these specific supply chain issues that are limiting production - indeed it would probably make them worse. if the goal is to increase economic production, employment and real living standards overall, the best course might just be to ride this out and let markets work to address the bottlenecks.",liberals

that being said, it’s an argument i could care less about unless there’s some legitimate cause for concern. i’m just pointing out that you’re calling for data that likely doesn’t exist, but that you probably don’t have much a foot to stand on with the claim of immigrant elderly being more productive than their canadian counterparts. it’s not something we can provide great metrics on and it’s a lot of anecdotal “he said, she said” type information.

that's what's so puzzling about this for me. this all feels like something that happens with a paper candidate for an unwinnable riding: no interested candidates, limited vetting, and little communication with party hq. i suppose that this isn't a must-win riding for the liberals, but considering how close the race has been, it should have still gotten enough attention to make sure that an acceptable candidate (for party brass) was found.

it makes me wonder if there was a preferred candidate being scouted, who declined to run at the last minute, forcing them to recruit ingraham as a backup. i also wonder if the middleman, the party contact who suggested she run, somehow exaggerated/obscured her credentials when presenting her to the party: for example, saying she's a \"successful small business owner\" (not mentioning it's just a barber shop, which isn't the first thing one thinks of for a small business candidate), not mentioning how young she is, not warning that she's very vocal about speaking her mind, etc. i mean, it feels like the party only had a vague picture about her when greenlighting her candidacy, but as more details trickled into hq, they started to get cold feet, thinking they were sold a bill of goods (not ingraham's fault, but the middleman). then they gambled that the short-term hit of an ejected candidate was better than having to deal with her background or opinions becoming a distraction later in the campaign, and past the point where a replacement can be added to the ballot. but they didn't consider how it looks to fire a candidate over risque photos (even if they weren't the _only_ reason), and the possibility that a candidate with few connections to the party would have no problem exposing inside information and burning bridges.",liberals

unfortunately raising the price of c02 will have terrible effect on our economy, the cost of living is already rising, further taxes will do nothing to slow that down. furthermore, if you price carbon too high businesses that produce capital for our country might go elsewhere, to places like china, where they don't give a shit about climate change or human rights.

there is a difference.

the green party leadership made it quite clear, through the message sent by the leader’s chief adviser and tacitly endorsed by the leader, that it would actively work to unseat her for the next election and that being pro-palestine was incompatible with remaining a green mp.

the liberals’ party stance on the issue, and the stance of the cabinet, is not aligned with ms atwin’s, but the party already has mps who have publicly taken a pro-palestine stance (nathaniel erskine-smith, for one) and the party leadership doesn’t try to boot them or publicly denounce them for it. large parties know that they will have differences of opinion among the caucus on some issues, and pick and choose which issues to force compliance on. eg trudeau made it clear that he would expel any mp who takes an anti-choice stance on abortion. the liberals simply don’t care to enforce a position on israel or palestine on their caucus.",liberals

the conservatives first came to power in alberta in 1971, and that legacy lasted until 2015.  there was a lot of disaffection with the party after all of that time and a lot of entitled behaviour that isn't really surprising from a 40 year dynasty.

2012 had the newcomer wildrose party (conservative but not conservative) flirting with power and in the lead up to the election they were the favourites, but a couple of [last minute snafus](https://www.macleans.ca/general/wildrose-candidate-predicts-eternity-in-the-lake-of-fire-for-gays-and-lesbians-polls-predict-wildrose-victory/) had people running back to the conservatives for the devil they knew.  the scandals just got worse for the re-elected conservatives and there was a fair share of [controversies](https://calgaryherald.com/news/alison-redford-resigns-seat-leaves-politics) over that term.

so when the 2015 election rolled around the wildrose party and the conservatives ended up splitting the vote allowing the ndp to win, the wildrose as official opposition, and it left the conservatives with just 10 seats.

that scared the conservatives in alberta so they recruited jason kenney as a new, fresh face and the wildrose party merged with the conservatives.  kenney then won in the 2019 matchup with a united right.

this new wildrose independence party formed in 2020 out of two loser independence parties, and has nothing to do with the old wildrose party.

so now we're back to the situation where kenney has shown he's just another conservative so people from both sides want to turf him.  the support that you're seeing in the polls is people not realizing that the new wildrose are an alberta-independence party and not just a conservative party without the conservative baggage.",conservatives

ok, if you believe this then why was your original point:

&gt; the highway saves more than 30 seconds.

does the highway save more than 30 seconds or is 30 seconds actually super good?

i don't actually know if $6 billion for 30 seconds is good value for money or not but i do know that the previous liberal government decided it wasn't and then when the current conservative government decided to resurrect the project they *didn't* say \"actually 30 seconds is super good and here's why\", instead they tried to shove that figure under the rug by using a different metric, much like you just did in your previous comment. this circuitous argument does not project confidence in the fundamental justification for the project. 

i also don't need to know if $6 billion for 30 seconds is a good figure or not to also consider that the highway runs through protected environmental lands and wetlands that doug ford also already promised touching was ['off the table'](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-wynne-greenbelt-development-election-1.4643189) and that ford's infrastructure projects have a habit of running [straight past the properties of people who are confirmed conservative donors](https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/2021/04/03/ford-friends-with-benefits-an-inside-look-at-the-money-power-and-influence-behind-the-push-to-build-highway-413.html). a subway through an existing city does not have these additional problems, building housing closer to where people are working doesn't have these additional problems.

as for 'nobody looks at the ontario line'? the ontario line has already been raked over the coals because it's a fucking atrociously bad use of money compared to the cost-benefit of the lrt line that was scrapped in its place. but i'll set that aside for the sake of argument: the ontario line doesn't have the same metrics as a highway because *people are charged to use it*. unless 413 is going to be a toll road ([opening another can of worms](https://www.thespec.com/news/canada/2019/09/03/birth-of-a-fiasco-how-the-ontario-tories-completely-botched-the-sale-of-highway-407.html)), it won't have the same capacity to recover the spent money. in addition, the ontario line was partially funded by the city and federal government so the considerations are different at a fundamental level. mass transit also enables cities to build at a higher density which saves money on municipal services, whereas a highway encourages low density sprawl which is well known to [bleed money for municipalities](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-true-costs-of-sprawl/article15218154/). is the federal government going to be willing to kick money towards a highway when justin trudeau just finished comitting at cop26 to eliminate investment in projects encouraging fossil fuel extraction and use?

as for peel and vaughan's growth: there are other ways to help with that like building up the mass transit infrastructure and enabling higher density development. toronto and the gta is one of the lowest density urban zones on the planet, we can deal with having some taller buildings. enabling wider mass transit use will reduce the number of cars on the road overall which *will* actually translate into direct time savings for everyone else on the roads. building another highway will encourage more car use, in turn costing people more time 'down the road'. this point is something doug ford doesn't understand at a fundamental level as he [claimed in the past that streetcars and surface level lrt would impede cars](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-light-rail-plans-example-of-war-on-the-car-1.1241683), completely ignoring the effect that reducing the number of motorists would have.

constituency offices are paid for with tax money, and the employees therein are employees of the parliament, not of the ndp, or bloc, or greens, or liberals. they are *not allowed* to use taxpayer resources for partisan purposes. that's why you'll never see partisan branding on a constituency office. yes, they paint the sign red or orange or blue, as case may be, but the actual party name never appears. 

you are being hyper-sensitive to perceived criticism of your guy, and not reading the article as an article.

there's a phenomenon in cognitive psychology called motivated reasoning. basically, your brain has an idea that it wants to be true, and you start cherry-picking data and arguments to fit, discarding or dismissing countervailing evidence. it happens to everyone and it isn't some moral failing, but it's happening to you here and you could do yourself a favour by trying to notice what you're doing and trying to correct for it.

a clc struggling to justify its support for the ndp despite its hard liberal turn in the west (not just bc ndp, but all of the prairie parties) is going to slip further into irrelevance.

this is a re-positioning of clc strategy, but there has been no break from the strategy of top-down / do-as-i-say labour leadership. more social media clicktivism, more expensive ad buys, more jockeying in the halls of power, while local union leaders and activists watch the rank and file slip further from them.",liberals

it’s very nerdy humour but considering the only opposition to the long form came from far right wing nuts (literally every respected economist and business analyst says this data is important and privacy law experts are always saying that stats canada’s privacy protection are the gold standard and are frustrated by other departments/agencies not having the same protections in place) it is appropriate to mock the conservatives for their nonsensical opposition to the long-form. the only reasonable explanation for the opposition was that they really did not care if their policies worked or not they were ideologically committed and didn’t want a bunch of serious mainstream economists telling them that their ideology was based on nonsense.",conservatives

it was about allowing francophones the ability to interact with their federal government. in that regard, it's been largely successful. when my great-grandmother was alive, the federal government didn't do everything in both languages; and it was a bit difficult for her generation. for my grandparents generation it was also somewhat tough, and for my parents generation things began to improve. by the time i came around in the 1990s i had the choice and the right to interact with the federal government in either language i wanted; and by that measure, official bilingualism was largely successful.

my great-grandmother was a huge trudeau sr. liberal. she was an extremely proud french canadian. she was so so so so so so so happy, so the stories go, that the government finally recognized french as equal to english. perhaps you can not relate to that, but it was also one of the reasons that despite being primarily francophone and raised in québec, she died an ardent federalist in ontario. she voted \"no\" in both referendums.

edit: my great-grandmother's brother was named after sir wilfrid laurier and they admired him and louis st-laurent quite a bit. she got to meet st-laurent, it was apparently a huge deal for her. not relevant, but a cool little fact about my great-grandmother i thought would be neat to share.",liberals
