no, because that's not what gerrymandering is. it's an issue of disproportionate seat allocation, but gerrymandering describes something entirely different.

the main reason for that disproportionality is something called the canadian constitution, which guarantees that every province is required to have at least as many mps as senators. now i think we'd both agree that the fathers of confederation made a complete mess of senate seat allocation. but the fact that the atlantic provinces have smaller ridings is not due to the government gerrymandering seats, it's because of a quirk in the constitution.

then there's something called the grandfather clause, i.e. no province can have fewer seats than they did in 1985. saskatchewan gets 4 grandfathered seats, quebec 3, manitoba 2, and ns and nl get 1 each. disagree with the law if you like, but there doesn't seem to be a partisan mismatch here considering sk always goes mostly conservative, nl and ns go mostly liberal, manitoba is a bit mixed and quebec is a wildcard. if it were gerrymandering (which is done to gain a political advantage), those five provinces would be weird choices.

again, gerrymandering is done to gain a political advantage. the current seats were drawn under the harper government. if gerrymandering was happening, why would the conservatives want an electoral system that gives more power to the maritimes and less to alberta?

furthermore, gerrymandering actually has nothing to do with population proportionality. in fact, in the us, all house seats are required to be roughly the same population (with smaller states this is harder to do, so this doesn't always apply). but if you look at some of the notoriously gerrymandered states like ohio and maryland, the populations of congressional districts are all consistent. disproportionate seat allocation and gerrymandering are entirely different things, and canada has very compactly-drawn seats compared to the states. usually they just follow census subdivision boundaries.",conservatives

&gt;the national research council of canada will work with the  manufacturers so that **if these vaccine trials are successful, canada can  produce and distribute it within the country.**  
&gt;  
&gt;dr. scott halperin, director of the canadian center for vaccinology at  dalhousie university, said the approval for the phase one clinical trial  was exciting news.  
&gt;  
&gt;**halperin said it's expected the first study using less than 100 healthy  volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 would likely get underway  within the next three weeks.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\"in those studies the main purpose is look at the safety of the vaccine  and how well it's tolerated by the people who get it,\" said halperin.  
&gt;  
&gt;he said the volunteers would be followed over the next six months and  if they show a safe immune response to the vaccine, researchers will  quickly transition into an expanded phase two study before the first  phase is even completed.

these are all articles from around mid-may.  the development of the vaccine and the applications submitted to phac occurred well before.  last time i provided this list the entry for cansino got removed.

but the application date was from march 2020, which means they were working on the vaccine and animal trials were successful before community infection started to take hold in canada.

&gt;the [collaboration announced on tuesday](https://www.canada.ca/en/national-research-council/news/2020/05/the-national-research-council-of-canada-and-cansino-biologics-inc-announce-collaboration-to-advance-vaccine-against-covid-19.html)  will allow canada's publicly funded research council to try to scale up  the technology needed to produce enough of the candidate vaccine to  protect canadians.  
&gt;  
&gt;matthew herder, director of the health law  institute at dalhousie university's law school in halifax, evaluated  contracts for the canadian ebola vaccine. that vaccine followed a  similar path from the lab bench to mass production. herder welcomed the  nrc announcement and awaits the details.

i'm only quoting this cbc article because it has the link to the actual pr from nrc and if i post those directly they tend to get taken down or modified. 

[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-national-research-council-strikes-deal-with-china-to-develop-test/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-national-research-council-strikes-deal-with-china-to-develop-test/)

&gt;now the nrc has struck an agreement to  support its development in canada by manufacturing doses that can be  administered in human tests and for emergency pandemic use.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Äúwe  are going to get to evaluate it for safety and efficacy in canada, as  is being done already in china, and canada will now be part of the  front-runner story,‚Äù said roman szumski, vice-president of life sciences  for the nrc.  
&gt;  
&gt;**if the tests succeed,  the vaccine candidate could seek health canada‚Äôs approval for emergency  use as early as this fall, mr. szumski said. it is already undergoing  concurrent first- and second-phase human trials in china.**  
&gt;  
&gt;ad5-ncov  is backed by tianjin-based cansino biologics inc. and the institute of  biotechnology of the academy of military medical sciences. it is a  recombinant vaccine, which uses a different type of virus ‚Äì in this case  an adenovirus ‚Äì genetically modified to include a spike protein that is  a signature of the deadly coronavirus. the adenovirus is itself  modified to prevent it from replicating. what it does instead is to  introduce the human body to the spike protein, preparing the immune  system to identify and destroy the coronavirus.  
&gt;  
&gt;cansino  and the nrc have a relationship that dates to the chinese company‚Äôs  development of an ebola vaccine, which was approved for use by beijing  in 2017. both the ebola vaccine and the coronavirus candidate can be  manufactured with hek293, a cell line derived from an aborted embryo in  1973 but modified by the nrc almost a decade ago to be a more prolific  producer of vaccines.

this is a very comprehensive background not only on how cansino was able to come up with an effective vaccine so fast (use of canadian recombinant vaccine technology) but also provides a bit of an understanding as to what is going on with those ebola scientists at the winnipeg lab.   

the real shame about whatever happened to deep-six this deal is not only that canada provided all the technology to create it or that it would have been manufactured here in canada - it is that despite the delays from the curfuffle with canada they were still able to complete the vaccine as promised in september.

&gt;they are not repeating the same rhetoric that the likes of national post and rex murphey are. they're not throwing what-aboutisms about blm and antifa when talking about the events in washington. they are not blaming the \"left\" nor claiming that the \"left\" is manipulating the media or rigging elections. these are all talking points by the \"alt-right\" with the intention of destabalising existing establishments for their own power gain.

good for them, but are you saying you are seeing this \"whataboutism\" in national post and post media?

&gt;this is stupid to make this one of those \"left vs right\" arguments. the simple fact of the matter is, at least in canada, only one political party and it's supporters are driving the same us style rhetoric and wedge issues. not the \"left\" and not all the right wig media either.

we'll just have to agree to disagree on that. left vs right is a spectrum, and it is no fault of the npd that liberals invaded their place in the political spectrum.

of course, the take-over is far from complete. a sizeable majority, 60%, of canadian conservatives remain resolutely canadian conservatives, repulsed by what trump stands for.  it helps that even those quebec conservatives who might otherwise be sympathetic to some of what trump says are detached from it because of the language and cultural barriers. 

but it should be recognised that to elect conservatives is to invite trumpists into the halls of power, with all the consequences that entails. even anti-trump conservatives are fully aware they cannot win or even maintain control of their own party without the new trump-wing's support, and cannot be expected to push back against them in a meaningful way.",conservatives

source? there's nothing in this story about hijackers. and nothing in the other stories i just scanned. i see governments *calling* it a hijacking, but nothing about \"hijackers on the plane\" i can find.

&gt; and the fighter jet sent to escort it down

fighter jets escorting aircraft in distress is standard practice. i don't see anything in the reporting which indicates the fighter jet did anything which forced the aircraft to land. a fighter was sent to escort that aircraft, like it would be almost anywhere else in the world. the pilots chose to land, because of the bomb threat.

&gt; and a fake bomb threat is also a form of force.

maybe. but closing airspace to force a plane to land also maybe a form of force. it has an identical end result.

&gt; closing airspace says you can't land here, it doesn't force you to land in a specific location like belarus did.

another distinction without a difference. if this plane was given multiple options inside belarus where it could land (it may have been, i don't know for a fact that it was told which airport to land at), that would make zero difference to the situation. likewise, the fact that morales' aircraft had multiple landing options, when all of those options were places where america could exert enough influence to have the plane searched, doesn't change the nature of that act.",liberals

i'm trying to argue that we have 4 options, realistically, on this file

1) be 100% logically consistent and ban every gun that resembles a gun the suburbs and urban areas are afraid of

2) be 100% logically consistent and don't ban any gun that is functionally the same no matter how scary it is to the suburbs

with these 2 it's divisive as hell and pisses off a whole camp of people no matter what for a wedge issue. guess who is gonna get the politic handshake on this one? option 1. why? urban ridings have more people in them. straight up. electorally catering to the gun crowd and being super strict on that position will not work. 

ok so what are the other 2 choices?

3) inconsistent, but with some reason/perspective you can sell to both sides

4) inconsistent but with some reason/perspective you can't sell to both sides

right now we're loving in 4, and it's not a good answer. it is *too* inconsistent. and it only sells to the suburban/urban side which is the issue we see electorally with point 2 above. and it's why that weekend with the cpc happened where they dropped a lot of points in the polls and the narrative shifted from trudeau fucking up an election call to a likely minority when considering the riding efficiency of the lpc since they have a small daily upswing in momentum right now.

so why can't we *try* 3. it makes the most people happy and reduces the laws from being the only thing we talk about and on which an election has swung because of \"guns scary\" ignoring the other substantive policies which have gotten next to no real traction so far in public discourse to the extent guns did.

&gt;for what it‚Äôs worth, senior conservative campaign officials were telling their partisans monday that their own internal party seat predictions have them winning between 135 and 145 seats. does that mean they‚Äôd win? well, if the conservative war room thinks it can win 145 seats, that‚Äôs definitely in (weak) minority territory. but if the cpc war room thinks the low end is 135 seats, it‚Äôs hard to see a scenario right now where just 135 seats puts you on the government side of the house.

&gt;more interesting, messages from senior conservative war room officials to campaigners say that some of the public polling purporting to show the people‚Äôs party of canada (ppc) in the double digits is too high. cpc internal polling, according to a conservative party source, has the ppc polling at around 5 per cent nationally.

gun owners who paid good money to lawfull acquire their firearms and only use them for peaceful purposes and sport are having their property confiscated without compensation and their rights stomped on. for 2 million canadian gun owenrs - that's a problem.

the cpi measure is offset by innovation and doesn‚Äôt capture asset inflation. cpi is more of a measure of wage and cost of living growth then actual inflation, which has been historically low.

&gt;	if borrowing costs for businesses increase, prices will be affected. increased prices will slow sales will feed a downturn in the economy. in hyper competitive international markets, it‚Äôll kill exports.
high domestic interest rates will generally make the dollar appreciate relative to other currencies with lower central rates.

i disagree with this. we don‚Äôt have supply issues so domestic prices will fall to match the lower demands of a stagnant deleveraging economy. canada‚Äôs exports are vastly materials and industrials, foreign companies don‚Äôt have vast alternatives to canadian products. also the dollar would likely show some weakness with the economy.

&gt;	interest rates are only a portion of the problem in housing. zoning is a far larger factor, the worst affected areas have policies that strongly favour r1 single family homes, usually with lower limits on lot and house sizes. higher interest rates will make it far harder for individuals to buy relative to corporations, who for the most part, can afford sit on empty units to ride out a downturn in prices.
&gt;
&gt;	if places like the gta had made it easier to build duplexes, triplexes and row-houses to back fill old neighbourhoods there wouldn‚Äôt be nearly the issue with housing they‚Äôre currently experiencing.

yes we do need to build more. corporations don‚Äôt generally buy residential housing and they sure don‚Äôt for long term. the investment portions are either landlords who seek profits through renting or short term flippers looking to make a quick buck. houses are extremely expensive to carry, no long term investor is going to look at them favourably when prices start to falling/stagnated and the costs to carry leverage and the value of liquid dollars climb.",liberals

i struggle with some of the zoning arguments because it's always presented in this black or white, 'change zoning laws or don't change zoning laws' way. the reality is that zoning and urban planning is super nuanced and should be taking into account both the wants and needs of the existing residents, the region's need for a cohesive region, and the specific nature and context of the neighbourhood that is being planned for. 

there's tons of suburbs and urban neighbourhoods that are purely just low rise single family homes that could use some mid rise apartments sprinkled throughout them, but there's also neighbourhoods that already have quite a lot of mid to high rise density and really don't need more, and then there's places like the downtown core of toronto that already has about 1000 residents per square foot of available green space and really shouldn't be densifying further.

well, yeah. nobody willingly will take a loss on their home unless they're desperate, so prices will not drop below their current levels. the prices will stagnate - hopefully long enough for people's wages to catch up (nominal wages, not real wages, since house prices are always pegged to the current value of the canadian dollar).

if prices correct it's going to be a bubble burst. and even that doesn't correct as much as you'd think - the average was around 25% during the 2008 crash in the us. while a 25% reduction is nice that's maybe 3-4 years of gains at most at current rates.",liberals

while you can debate why they‚Äôre efficient and equitable, there is still a strong point that by adopting a two tier system they did not sacrifice efficiency or equitability. the concern would be doctors leave and go to the private industry, no doctors are left to serve to public sector, the wait times in public sector increase, and there is inequality as the rich have access to good health care and the poor are stuck with the bad one. so the fact that they are high in both equitability and efficiency means that the two tier system didn‚Äôt compromise those things, and doctors leaving for the private sector didn‚Äôt turn out to be an issue that affected their healthcare sustem",liberals

i'm absolutely not saying that the government should only be concerned with the plight of low-income people at all. but people making average income should not require subsidies to afford housing. the fact that they do is because government policy is primarily concerned with boosting home values, at the expense of affordability. rather than dumping more money into the system, we need to actually have policies that make houses *cheaper*.",liberals

hd43s1r,2021-09-16T04:59:52.000-07:00,"barack obama endorses justin trudeau ahead of the election: 'i'm proud of the work we did together' none of the two responses so far are very neutral responses... i'll try my best.

\"neoliberal\" generally refers to a pro-democratic pro-regulated-free-market economic doctrine that generally is pretty minimalistic on the regulatory side and favours privatization over nationalization, and pay-as-you-go over public institutions (e.g. a neoliberal would probably want people to pay more for university tuition fees). neoliberal figures are typically socially progressive, but because of their preference for free markets and privatization, these stances are often low-impact.

people on the right usually critique neoliberals for such socially progressive stances, or for the regulations that impede free markets.

people on the left usually critique neoliberals for their destructive effects on public institutions (to continue the last example, defunding public education is a pretty neoliberal thing to do, the assumption is that people are willing/capable to pay for their own education).",liberals

yeah, i think this is a problem. there are always going to be people in society who can't afford the market cost of housing. there are also inequalities, for example children require more housing space, but do not generate household income (indeed they tend to reduce it), thus placing families at a disadvantage in the market. finally, homeownership is so subsidized that levelling the paying field a bit would be positive.

on the whole though, i agree that rent subsidies should play a minor role and direct provision of affordable housing should play a larger one.

&gt;we could simply build more public housing, but would need to apply some hard lessons learned in terms of operations

i think those lessons have actually been learned. all affordable housing built today is mixed income and has been for some time.

&gt;ultimately, we need a mechanism to determine who gets to live in the most desirable neighborhoods and cities that people feel is a fair approach and which accounts for the people who live their currently. i imagine getting consensus on that across the political spectrum will be a tall order.

i don't think it necessarily is. i think every neighbourhood should be mixed income, with a balance of family housing, affordable non-profit housing and even some luxury housing. i don't think this is a particularly controversial view.

there are some people who don't want to let lower-status people live in their neighbourhoods and unfortunately our system greatly empowers them to get their way. but i don't think the broader population wants that and this issue is in many ways about asserting the democratic will here.",liberals

it's generally accepted that neoliberal is a broader term used to describe governments that legislated economic austerity measures that favoured corporations and the wealthy over unions and the working class, oversaw trade-agreements that outsourced well-paying jobs to the increased profit of the wealthy, and general dismantling of important regulations.

we saw neoliberal policy at its height in the early 1980's to the 2007 sub-prime mortgage meltdown and 2008 great recession.

neoliberalist administrations are found on both sides of the 'status quo' political parties. notable past examples include:

that's very much debated.

&gt;retired lt.-gen. rom√©o dallaire, who oversaw the 1994 un mission in rwanda that failed to prevent that country's genocide, questioned the use of the word.

&gt;\"is that an act of genocide? is it?\" dallaire said, adding he has \"a problem\" with how the inquiry used the word. 

&gt;\"my definition of genocide, i read it very deliberately at the start of the rwandan genocide, and it was a deliberate act of a government to exterminate deliberately, and by force and directly, an ethnicity or a group or an entity of human beings.\"

&gt;the former senator did say he feels that canadians, especially politicians, have responded ineptly to the needs of indigenous women and girls.

&gt;\"that is scandalous and that is unacceptable in a country that has a charter and believes that all humans are human,\" dallaire said.

&gt;human rights lawyer and former attorney general irwin cotler also suggested the inquiry's use of the word genocide was inappropriate.

&gt;\"perhaps they had to use a term like genocide in order to sound the alarm and people will take notice and finally action will result,\" cotler said monday.

&gt;\"but i think we have to guard against using that term in too many ways, because then it will cease to have the singular importance and horror that it warrants.\"

had the government done what the uk did, and quickly give money to some of these companies to ramp up their production ability, we could have been producing vaccine under license, as dozens of other countries are doing. instead the government tried to do a deal with a chinese company, and was predictably betrayed. it also tried to ramp up production at a government research lab, going so far as to assure us it would be producing vaccines by november (last november). that went predictably wrong.  other western countries were giving money to the big pharmaceutical companies to help them develop vaccines (and be first in line). what the liberals did, when they realized how far behind they were, was to spray cash around with a fire hose at every company which might have vaccines to sell. i'm fairly sure if an honest audit is ever done of this it will turn out we spent more per vaccine than any other country in the world.

and the reason we've been able to give the first shot to so many is because no one is getting the second shot. we are the only country which is giving just one shot, and then are going to wait four months to give the second. there isn't a lot of science behind this, but it looks better if the numbers are high and this government is all about appearance.",liberals

my problem with that equation is that although the monarchy has had its hand in tragedies, that doesn't mean the institution hasn't or can't continue to grow into something different.  england also perpetrated these tragedies, and so has every other country, along with countless other religious institutions or political parties.  this isn't necessarily sufficient to qualify these things as inherently or completely racist and genocidal, because that in turn would justify their abolition.  we can't abolish everything, but we can abolish some of everything. in other words - we can reform.  

and the monarchy has reformed - grown into something different. their work is charitable and apolitical.  they draw attention toward important issues.  staunch conservatives can look at prince charles and recognize that the environmental crisis is present and important.  lady diana's role in normalizing aids is unmeasurable.  prince william and princess kate are working constantly to address issues of mental health.  and people are listening.   

there are still issues, like prince andrew.  but prince andrew is not the monarchy, rather a bad actor within it.  and he should face justice.  i'm not sure what the queen has personally done to prevent justice being done, but i know his lawyers are certainly putting forward a legal defence on his behalf (and on a similar note, this is not a reason to paint all lawyers with the same brush either).",conservatives

an mp brought forth a motion, which was not by any means legislation. any sitting mp can introduce a motion, separate from party lines. it‚Äôs not popular for mps to do so, as they typically like to pass motions that are favourable among lines but is not in any way required. harper wouldn‚Äôt have much, if anything to do with this because the mp doesn‚Äôt need to pass it by him first and there‚Äôs no indication he did. 

at the time the member introduced the motion, even with a majority conservative government it was shot down by 203-91 with about half of the conservative vote being nay to even bring it to debate. the senators who voted yes in favour of the motion were unlikely to bring any type of motion to the table themselves; primarily because woodworth was ‚Äúspecial‚Äù, even amongst conservatives. he‚Äôs a capital c conservative on the social side. 

he tried the motion again later and it blew up in his face again, predictably. he later founded an anti-abortion organization; that‚Äôs the kind of mp that the house was dealing with. 

keep in mind that the current conservative party feels the need to toe the line with socon‚Äôs. judging by how a big section isn‚Äôt comfortable with reopening the abortion debate i feel it would be a safe assumption that they soft-speak around it because they don‚Äôt want to split their party up the way that the left leaning parties have. it‚Äôs a threat to a majority conservative government, and in their eyes if they need to play the whole field to maintain that control; they will. is it right? no, not at all. i does it mean that harper allowed anything to happen? also no. o‚Äôtoole will likely take the same stance and allow the socons to fail of their own volition when they attempt to do something similar.

edit: it should be noted that while harper had ties to christian right wing political groups, the example provided above was specifically a motion and could be introduced by any sitting mp. i believe the debate should stay dead and the socons need to form their own party, as their hollowed our dying visage is keeping the conservative party from more progressive decisions that make them actual political competitors.",conservatives

likewise, the liberals also retook a seat from the ndp as well as (effectively) the greens in atwin.

hdq43lb,2021-09-21T01:00:26.000-07:00,"discussion thread - the 44th canadian general election if canada ever wants the stability of a majority more often, i think the progressive vote is going to have to enter into more formal arrangements. 

the lpc are hesitant since they don't want to lose seats to the ndp, but a handshake on confidence isn't sufficient for the strength of a 4 year mandate to stick around.

the ndp and lpc already have very similar platforms so it's not like they will be voted down anytime soon, but after the very negative anti-trudeau sentiment that singh ran on, i don't know how this parliament is going to go.

best case for the ndp is pushing a more progressive version of lpc policy through

best case for the cpc is trudeau losing more cachet with the public and making some big mistakes and being held to account

best case for the lpc is a no scandal two years where they make progress on key issues and deliver their platform without going *too* progress so they can still claim the centre.

the next election is going to be very interesting. we're certainly waiting for a confidence motion to bring them down. 

but it's clear to me that, at least right now, the bigger voting block is certainly progressive. 

to my mind the cpc has the right idea of moderating to try and get them. maybe if people weren't so worried about covid and status quo for now they might have won. maybe ppc wouldn't have siphoned a handful of votes in key ridings if it wasn't for covid but i don't think they caused problems for enough seats to have changed the outcome.

i think it has more to do with the cpc being too far away from the progressive folks and the suburbs and urban areas.

there are clearly some poison pill wedges that the majority of canadians won't take like gun control which really turned the tide.

it's possible people really didn't want the childcare deals ripped up either though that would probably be a bigger deal if they had been actioned and not just signed. i think that program is here to stay and so is climate change carbon tax. 2 more years on those will keep them here forever. 

so then the question becomes: where else does the cpc go? the climate issue is only going to get worse. and unless they decide to go all in on a retooling of alberta and the prairies energy strategies, idk what they can really do or say?

the only leg they'd really have is an austerity one post pandemic probably. but even there depending on when the pandemic ends for us, the lpc might have confidence to start dealing with it. out of one crisis and into another people may not want to rock the boat too much especially if confidence motion takes the liberals down at a key juncture.

people say we ended up in the same place but strategically i think the liberals are in a powerful place right now and they've bought at least 2 years maybe more before the winds really change.

the cpc are going to need a lot of soul searching for the next run and the lpc are gonna need to really fuck up and have some big skeleton found to get anything less than a minority for the next few years imo.",liberals

1. as anyone who has picked up a newspaper or tuned into the news over the last 36 days can attest, that's just demonstrably wrong.

i think that is not an accurate summary, except under the most stringent definition of the words. if we are being super technical, then i suppose no one knows anything on any subject, but that's usually not the standard we hold ourselves to.

from your own data, from the relevant lines, we have \"about half\" from the us. 

52% from the us. 

80-50% from international sources. 

69% from the us. 

46% were smuggled. 

84% from us

i never said it was acceptable for people to have firearms to be possessed by the public.

&gt;why on earth would our civilian police need to firearms designed to \"maximize the body count?\" who's bodies are the self-admitted systemically racist rcmp going to be filling with lead? natives? racialized populations? who are they going to be using these battlefield murder machines on?

&gt;surely these dangerous battlefield weapons belong in secured and fortified armouries and on the battlefield, not on our streets where they can be easily stolen. right?

gogjbrb,2021-02-22T21:45:44.000-08:00,"pierre trudeau may have asked business leader to move jobs from quebec, says u.s. state department document &gt;that memo ‚Äî¬†which was marked \"nodis\" ¬†for \"no distribution\"  ‚Äî¬†paints a picture of a cozy relationship between trudeau and enders.  after debating ideas, they agreed to continue to talk in the future and  to \"conceptualize\" together,¬†although trudeau asked enders not to share  that with his cabinet ministers.

we cannot rely on trudeau sr. cabinet ministers to get the truth since, pierre trudeau was notorious for making decisions alone.

do you remember his famous quote **\"just watch me\"**? notice that he did not say \"just watch us\", \"us\" meaning his government, his cabinet, he said \"me\" and that for two reasons: first trudeau made decisions alone and, second, when you are going to do something possibly illegal, you don't tell anyone, this way, if his ministers ever had to testify, they knew nothing.

there is no doubt pierre trudeau felt intense hate for separatists and proof of that is found in the mcdonald commission when it was demonstrated trudeau told the rcmp to \"do what they must\" to counter quebec separatism and that led the rcmp to commit criminal acts. \"do what you must but don't tell me what you do\"... good enough for plausible deniability.

the [criminal acts committed by the rcmp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_controversies_involving_the_royal_canadian_mounted_police#barn-burning_scandal) caused it to lose its responsibility of national security and caused the creation of the csis.

&gt;prior to 1984 security intelligence in canada was the purview of the [royal canadian mounted police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_canadian_mounted_police) (rcmp). however, in the 1970s there were allegations that the [rcmp security service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rcmp_security_service)  ‚Äì the predecessor to csis ‚Äì had been involved in numerous illegal  activities. as a result of these allegations, in 1977, justice david  macdonald was appointed to investigate the activities of rcmp security  service. the resulting investigation, known as the [mcdonald commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/royal_commission_of_inquiry_into_certain_activities_of_the_rcmp),  published its final report in 1981, with its main recommendation being  that security intelligence work should be separated from policing, and  that a civilian intelligence agency be created to take over from the  rcmp security service.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian\\_security\\_intelligence\\_service#history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_security_intelligence_service#history)

it is doubtful the rcmp would have taken such a risk without having been given some sort of assurances, nobody would jeopardize his pension without knowing there was a safety net, and many believed at the time and still believe that the rcmp took the bullet for the pm in exchange to what amounted to a slap on the wrist for those involved.

i don't support the att system because it does nothing but cost money and create hassle. by the same logic i find magazine capacity limits serve no purpose; if you want to circumvent them it takes all of five minutes and a pair of pliers.

i oppose by-name bans because they're inherently arbitrary. i support the overall length/action type classification regime that does exist already. the fact that i can own a gun of the same action type, calibre, length, and magazine capacity as an ar-15 and take it in the woods for target shooting (but not hunting in ontario as the calibre is too small) and cannot own an ar-15 because... whatever the current reason is... is comical. it's like banning mustangs but not camaros.

i think everything i suggest above is a streamlining of current laws which provide no reduction in public safety but additional freedom (i'm loathe to use the word in this context because the topic in america has tainted it for this discussion but i lack a better one) to law-abiding gun owners to enjoy their hobbies.

conservative rhetoric and policies on climate change have focused on taking action in ways that don't affect individuals. industrial regulation has become a focal point; look no further than the ucp, who replaced the provincial carbon tax with a renewed industrial carbon pricing scheme (basically bringing back the sger). o'toole's rhetoric has focused on \"big emitters\" and i believe the rejected resolution at the cpc convention included language around targeting large emitters. and now kenney is musing about cap and trade being an option for alberta.",conservatives

though sometimes an unpopular candidate/party only wins because the alternative happen to be more unpopular. if we're looking at ontario, even though mcguinty and wynne were unpopular, tim hudak was the leader of the pc's for two seperate elections and was a very outspoken social conservative with the personality of a turnip. he couldn't even make ground against the olp in the face of multiple scandals'/allegations of corruption etc.

but at the same time that's also generally evidence of your point that popularity/unpopularity tends to undersell the nuisances of election results etc. ford is probably more unpopular to hudak to most people outside of his die hard base (where he's probably liked a bit more than hudak), but by 2018, the electorate had just had enough of olp. horwarth probably tends to be the most likeable candidate to the average voter, but a good percentage don't seem to share her policies, while much like layton's federal ndp, although largely likeable and non-threatening to most of the electorate, neither was able to become leader of the opposition until the liberals imploded for one reason or another etc.

&gt; some have suggested that trudeau, especially after this gruelling pandemic year, is getting weary of politics and his demanding job. that speculation, however, ignores just how much the prime minister has actually been consolidating his circle of power; leaning more heavily on those he trusts and being far more cautious with those outside the circle.

&gt; bains talked to my colleague heather scoffield on tuesday and she kindly asked a couple of questions for me. ... trudeau still has the same energy he had back in the early days, bains said. ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a machine.‚Äù

could be he's just playing coy and hedging his bets so as not to ignite the opposition cheerily \"counting down\" to his eventual retirement. or it could be that he really does see a possibility where he matches or comes close to his father's tenure. it's plausible in theory, considering the shallowness of the cpc benches and the leadership of a party with a *very* damaged \"brand\" [not being so much of a \"prize.\"](https://outline.com/vxh8lx)

although i thought i had read or heard him say at some point earlier he didn't want to stay on more than eight or ten years, but that might have changed as he grew into the job. when he was much younger he gave interviews strongly resisting a political career because he recalled how grueling it was for a pm's children, and the nastiness of political competition in general. it seems obvious now that with the advent of social media and 24/7 cable news, and the tories no longer being the party of statesmen like stanfield and clark, that nastiness has only gotten worse.

it's smart of him not to pick any favourites as potential successor so as not to divide the caucus, though. for all anyone knows, there might be someone else waiting in the wings to challenge freeland for heir to the trudeau legacy.

i'm sure his eventual memoir is going to be lit. trump as a chapter could fill a whole book. wonder what he will do once he leaves though, if he'll go back to being a schoolteacher (as he told rosie barton some years back) or stay in some kind of political/diplomatic function, or something in the private sector. i mean mulroney went on to be a cannabis investor, so...",liberals

cbc's [seat projection](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/) calls for a 3-29 seat gain for the ndp, under the category of 'likely'.

i'd say that is very unlikely.

in what possible areas in our nation is singh going to make headway where he hasn't already?

the maritimes?  unlikely.

quebec?  nope.

gta?  nope.

all he can get he already has:  lefty rural areas centers.  mid-northern ontario.  northern manitoba.  nunavut.  and the pacific coast.  plus select hippie urban zones.

one thing that yesterday's french language debate indicated is that singh will not make any ground in quebec, and that's vital for him to gain that many seats.

so based on this analysis, the only trouble trudeau could possibly be in is from eot, who thus far has worked to mirror the libs as much as he can.  

the mirroring won't convince most centrist lib supporters to switch, because why bother?  and it certainly won't convince the cynical voters to switch, because we've seen cpc policy flip from 'nice' mode to 'dark' mode fairly recently.

re read my comment. i said that ‚Äúi think it is wrong when the government uses social construct like race or personhood as an excuse to limit the the rights of certain demographics of society.‚Äù it should go without saying that one doesn‚Äôt have the freedom to interfere with the freedom that someone else has under law. i am not allowed to street race because it threatens someone else‚Äôs safety and puts fully developed human lives at risk. child rape is rightly illegal because there is real documented scientific evidence that sexual abuse is very damaging.

i honestly don't know how the cpc will fix or get past this. social conservatism will continue to cost them votes and prevent them from winning elections. o'toole wants to show people that the cpc has become a more moderate party that is inclusive, but it's sort of hard to believe when banning conversion therapy is still a controversial topic in their party.


then you have people in the party that are upset over the thought of him embracing the carbon tax, which is arguably a necessary step to pivot to the centre and appeal to urban voters.


o'toole gets a lot of blame for the cpc doing poorly right now, but maybe it's not entirely his fault. maybe it has something to do with the cpc. it doesn't really matter who the leader is, these problems won't go away.",conservatives

i'm pointing my finger at the cbc here because, while it's not unreasonable for any given funding recipient/stakeholder organization to be unfamiliar with how incremental budgeting in government works, the cbc's politics reporters are the people who are supposed to know better. they're the media because they \"mediate\" claims like this one to make sure the public is presented with facts in-context.

&gt;because that really isn't what this looks like.

what *does* it look like to you? i see a table that says \"measures announced since the economic and fiscal snapshot,\" which lists all of the emergency funding that was rolled out between july and november. again - in incremental terms (ie new funding only), because that's what's always done.

edit: with a disclaimer that i might be missing something, it looks like the original announcement came from [budget 2019](https://www.budget.gc.ca/2019/docs/plan/chap-04-en.html#making-canada-accessible-and-supporting-people-with-disabilities) and the funding was for five years (ie until 2023-24). the fall economic statement didn't cut anything, but it didn't extend that funding beyond 2023-24 either (which isn't to say that the funding won't be extended, but those decisions aren't usually made three years in advance...). regardless, we can probably expect some clarification from minister qualtrough's office sometime in the coming days....",liberals
