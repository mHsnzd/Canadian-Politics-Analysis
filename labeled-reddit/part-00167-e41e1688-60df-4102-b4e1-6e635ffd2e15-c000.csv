wow a recent controversy involving quebec and quebec is on the front page? a real shocker, next thing you’re gonna tell me is that it was all about alberta when jason kenny caused the 4th wave, that it was all about the gta during election season, that it was all about bc during the floods. evidently when there’s a huge event involving a province people tend to talk about that event.

and it’s a specific thread about quebec being unable to meet its climate goals, and you’re complaining that people are criticizing quebec for it? valid criticism is not “quebec bashing”

&gt;while for québec, it's now common to read things like \"all québécois are bigots\".

people aren’t fucking saying that. at worst they’re saying is “quebec is a racist province” which is not the same. again, valid criticism isn’t quebec bashing, you can’t pass racist legislation and then get mad when people call you out for racist legislation.


&gt;people are leaving canadian subs because they get bullied every time they talk, even if they're against the bill. 

if you defend aspects of the bill you should be prepared for people to disagree with you. it’s not a uniquely anti-quebec sentiment, it’s politics, if you change flair to conservative and start spouting some pro-oil nonsense guarantee you’ll find the same amount of opposition.

&gt;there is also the whole equalization thing that comes up constantly for no reason. it's in this thread too. even if it's based on a lot of twisted facts of false truths. no one bashed nb or manitoba even though they get way more equalization per capita and more social/health transfers. it's easy to hate on québec.

because quebec receives the most overall, and unlike manitoba and nb quebec has ridiculous sway over national politics, if any other province does something drastic they’ll receive an immediate challenge from the federal government, but when quebec does something on par you get stuff like otoole telling his mp’s to say *nothing* regarding quebec, or trudeau refusing to challenge the bill legally. more then any other province quebec has disproportionate control over our national politics while simultaneously being a huge welfare baby.

besides that, nobody has lost their job for calling alberta drunk on oil money, nobody lost their job for saying nb mooches off the rest of the countries money, or saying the gta is an idiotic voting block. but call quebec racist? get fired from the university of ottawa. bring up system racism in quebec during the english language debates? all federal leaders demand an apology from you. you can freely criticize any province but the very second you think about criticizing quebec the nationalists are out in full force, crying about quebec bashing and how it’s oh-so unfair that somebody criticized their province.",liberals

  there is a massive market for people who fall prey to biased outlets of information and massive amounts of money to be made off the backs of these folk. it may be too late to \"put the genie back in the bottle\"

what needs to happen now is educating younger generations to better interpret information. teach them to be able to spot and question what they see and hear and to be aware of disinformation. teach them the negative impacts it has had. facebook has been used in other countries to indoctrinate the population and pit them against other ethnic or cultural groups. this happened in myanmar with the rohingya genocide. the same is happening now in ethiopia. if younger people were well informed about the damage done by social media perhaps they will be the generation to abandon it in favor of something different and less toxic.",liberals

the ndp's most plausible route to power runs through progressively leaning on the lpc harder over time (in both senses of 'progressively') and eventually flipping the applecart over when singh thinks he can break the lpc... or, i guess, getting most of his desired legislation passed? plausible outcomes of that *could* look like 2011 again, but of course singh would prefer if it's more orange than blue.

it makes me wonder if singh would be happier in the position he is now (smaller, but with leverage to pass legislation) or as the official opposition to a conservative government. i think in this scenario;

well...it's not the woman's body though...it's a separate body inside of her (whether you think that separate, very early version of a body should have rights is up for debate, i suppose). i think abortion should be legal only because it is a necessary evil, as the women hellbent enough to do it would just get it done in a more dangerous way, as you've said. i acknowledge that we live in an imperfect world, which means we need imperfect solutions.

&gt;a point to note here is that if we (the world, not just canada) had locked down strongly at the start, restricted travel and socialization almost completely we would have been over this pandemic by now.

i agree with that bit, at least. if flights had been restricted in the early days, a lot of this could've been avoided.

i think having a social safety net is important...how extensive it should be is up for debate. right wingers aren't entirely against a social safety net (at least not the conservatives...the people's party seem to be though). it needs to strike a balance between adequately taking care of those who need the help, while also incentivizing and rewarding work.

i however don't think the government should have the power to decide which businesses are essential...that is way too much power to say these people in this field aren't allowed to work but these other people are. people are losing their businesses that they've spent years building and forced out of work.

a) the short version is, you create an administrative body with the goal to reduce costs and create a more responsive and efficient process than what the police and courts can provide. they specialize. there’s a trade off here as administrative tribunals have less technical evidenciary rules and simpler procedure. so, legal fees for people are much lower and the process is easier to access because it’s less complicated. at the same time there are fewer controls on competing parties to abuse process.  this is usually balanced by the fact that tribunals don’t make decisions that impact “life, liberty., and security of the person.”


with c-36 it’s important (i think) because we’ve never properly defined hate speech and that’s an issue (see your frustration above) that creates ambiguity and uncertainty. 

b) i think you’re confusing bill c-10 and c-36. anyways, hate speech in b-36 is basically speech that incites others to vilify another party on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination (disability, race, and so on.) from the text … 

&gt;13(1) it is a discriminatory practice to communicate or cause to be communicated hate speech by means of the internet or other means of telecommunication in a context in which the hate speech is likely to foment detestation or vilification of an individual or group of individuals on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.

sub (2) to (8) then are various exemptions and qualifications (eg. language that notes you’re not liable for simply hosting or pointing it out.)

&gt;(9) in this section, hate speech means the content of a communication that expresses detestation or vilification of an individual or group of individuals on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.

&gt;(10) for greater certainty, the content of a communication does not express detestation or vilification, for the purposes of subsection (9), solely because it expresses mere dislike or disdain or it discredits, humiliates, hurts or offends",liberals

two things. 

1) i should have been clear that i didn't think blanchet was actually saying that. to say someone is openly ethnonationalist is a very loaded accusation. i have a low opinion of blanchet, but he's not exactly like that.

2) finding the video, there's no reference to ethnicity by trudeau either. it could be interpreted as a reference to opinion. that said, it's just open enough that it could be interpreted as being about ethnicity, maybe. i did anyways. maybe i shouldn't have there either. saying you cynically dish out the loaded accusation of someone being ethnonationalist for political points is also a loaded accusation.

here's the video for reference.

https://youtu.be/yhjxdt4nkt8

the point i was trying to make was that i think trudeau had this response prepared, locked and loaded as a soundbite against blanchet. \"i *am* quebecois, how dare you forget, and therefore my opinion on quebec is valid.\" this works, but it's a cheap move in my opinion and one freeland can never, ever use. 

the goal of my post was to talk about the things trudeau can do politically, that freeland could never do. it was not really to slander blanchet.

the most common measure of economic growth is percentage increases in gross domestic product, which is a measure of the overall value of nation’s economy. 2014-2015 we saw a huge dip. enter the liberals. 

the international monetary fund tracks annual percentage increases in gdp. based on those figures, canada’s growth in 2016 — the first full year of the trudeau liberals’ government — was 1.1 per cent, according to the imf, which was the same figure recorded in italy and france and half a percentage point above japan, which finished last in the g7 that year.

but since, canada has either led g7 countries — once, in 2017 — or been second in annual growth behind the united states. the covid happened, and the government made the decision to support people financially through an unprecedented pandemic.

firstly, defence is not murder. secondly, it's not the first response when you give them the option to leave your things and exit. and **again**, this is a justification for fixing those problems, **not** a justification for allowing people to steal and making people either risk their personal safety to stop it, or have to pay for other people's crime.

&gt;no personal safety rights are violated by mere theft, only the right to your property is interfered with. they are totally separate concepts.

a thief attempting to violate my personal property rights means people are either required to act in a manner which means those rights do not actually exist, endanger themselves to protect those rights, or ensure those rights and their safety with maximum certainty. one of these is moral, the other two are not, and the moral option is neither allowing yourself to be robbed or putting your law-abiding self in needless danger to protect a thief.

&gt;and by choosing to engage in violence with intent to kill as a first resort,

not a first resort, the first resort is to tell them to leave without taking anything. the next resort is to protect my property by the method most sure for accomplishing the task and with as little risk to me as possible.

&gt;they did not choose to risk their life by stealing

they absolutely did.

&gt;the last three already allow for the use of force when there is a real risk of it, and by real i mean they are banging on your bedroom door knowing you are inside of it

and when they've kicked down your door, it shouldn't have to get to that point. this is where our government allows for our rights only on paper, but not practically.

&gt;you are acting directly against any laws that could protect your actions and you would absolutely be convicted of murder or manslaughter.

firstly, i can assure you that wouldn't be happening. secondly, on the very minute chance it did, well, people go to prison for moral actions all across the globe. i acknowledge that we live in an unjust society with defensive laws which are focused on keeping the poors in line instead of ensuring people's charter rights to life, liberty, and security of person.

&gt;, i am opposing your attempt to justify murder as a first response to theft rather than using the social systems in place to address it.

that's not what's happening here. i'm saying 100% fund and address the systemic issues which motivate crime, *but* that if someone breaks down someone's door in the wee hours of the morning \"get out or there will be severe consequences\" is a perfectly reasonable choice, and it's their choice. if you don't like the options in that particular choice you should lobby the federal government to permit civilian possession and use of less-than-lethal alternatives for use against humans, like oc spray and tasers. i would be happy to use those as a more appropriate intermediate step, but until those are available options i'm still not going to risk myself to protect the person trying to victimize me.

&gt;the thief whose only intent to harm someone physically is in your imagination? you are equating the intent to steal to the intent to cause harm for every thief....you are trying to equate the fact a person is stealing to the fact they also intend to commit assault, sexual assault, or murder. this is fundamentally not true.

nope, i'm saying two things here: one, i'm going to stop them from violating my property rights which may incur resistance on their part. i'm not going to risk my safety to protect the safety of the person trying to rob me. they can leave, or i'm going to use the easiest, safest, and most sure method possible to stop them from robbing me. two, break and enters have a non-zero track record of turning into assaults, murders, and sexual assaults, and they've already violated a home. so again, they are going to leave, or i'm going to use the easiest, safest, and most sure method possible to ensure that doesn't happen.

they have options: don't steal, when caught leave voluntarily when directed to do so, or leave involuntarily.

&gt;never once justified theft

...

&gt;...situations that make theft necessary.

yeah. that one is pretty self explanatory.

&gt;they can also just call the police and not engage with the thief by staying where they are safe, in your words \"pretty easy to do\".

you've  literally gone from trying to excuse theft to trying to justify it saying that not stealing within our current society is hard, even though most of the population aren't thieves, to saying theft is not just warranted as you previously implied, but now \"necessary.\" the fact that this is your position on violation of individual rights means that you're unable to have a good faith discussion about violation of those rights, because you either don't believe those rights exist, or believe that the response to having them violated is to allow them to be violated.

so again, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. don't want to risk the immediate consequences? don't steal from people.",liberals

for me personally, things trudeau has done fairly well:

- legalized cannabis (however, the way it was legalized was kind of controversial, some people didn't like that it was too \"corporate\" and smaller growers haven't had enough of a role)

- cutting inequality by raising income taxes on the wealthiest 1% of canadians by 4 percent, offering a universal tax cut, and sending cheques to all parents with children, which have made a dent in the poverty rate. (however, some people on the left still think he should tax the rich more)

- climate policy, introducing a carbon tax and then announcing it's going to become one of the highest in the world in 10 years' time, forcing all the coal plants to close by 2030, ban on methane venting, and new rules to force cars to be more fuel-efficient (however, he continues to support the oil industry, and a new government-owned pipeline is being built. some people think he should be blocking pipelines and trying to phase out oil ... personally i don't mind a more gradual transition as much because oil does offer a lot of high-paying jobs that are hard to replace)

some things that people criticize him for:

- not good at transparency and honesty in government (ha! he's got his share of scandals, including messing with the justice department to get a major company charged with corruption in africa out of trouble. but every pm of my lifetime has done a few sketchy things. i don't think we'll ever see a politician that isn't corrupt to some degree, it just comes with power)

- any logistical or operational stuff, they're not very good at. there's some old warships and planes in the military that still haven't been replaced. also, we really weren't very prepared for this pandemic, and some of the public health systems we used to have were shut down or defunded.

- firearms policy. this is an area where i think it really is \"all show\". they announced a new ban on \"assault rifles\", which are already banned, and ended up tweaking the rules to prohibit more types of guns, but just kind of randomly picked a few well-known guns instead of making rules for which guns are too dangerous to be allowed and so on.

- budgeting. we are, of course, in a major deficit right now because of the pandemic, but a lot of people think he should have spent less money in the first few years so we'd have more to spend now.

overall, i think the guy actually does want to make the country a better place, but he also shies away from anything too revolutionary, and sometimes get into scandals because of his celebrity friends. he's the kind of guy who'd rather work within the system to deliver changes where it's fairly possible, like a barack obama or tony blair, but don't expect him to pick a fight with the banks or overthrow the system or anything like that.

i'd probably rate him a little better than the last two long-serving pms harper and chretien, but i wouldn't call any of those three \"great\" prime ministers.",liberals

population of ontario is 14.6 million. [no one knows](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19) what percentage of a population needs to be vaccinated against covid-19 to reach herd immunity. the most optimistic estimate i could find is [60%](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-immunity-analysis-iduskbn27y124).

0.6 * 14 million = 8.4 million. each person would need two doses, so that's 2 * 8.4 million = 17 million total doses. there are 360 days left in 2021, so you'd need (17 million doses) / (360 days) = 47k doses per day. starting tomorrow.

but that's assuming 60% vaccination rate gives you herd immunity. polio requires 80%, measles requires 95%. so if covid requires 90%, we'd need 63k doses per day. and that's assuming we start *tomorrow*, jan 6th, which is not possible.

assuming that we're able to ramp up procurement and distribution of vaccines to \"full throttle\" by the end of march, from then on we'd have to do more like 80k per day to reach herd immunity by the end of the year. i hope we're able to ramp things up a lot faster than that.",liberals

that is to say this - if you're more worried about myocarditis from the vaccine than covid you need to give your fucking head a shake. if you're more worried about blood clots from a vaccine than covid? you need to give your fucking head a shake. its about assessing risk like everything in life. there world is not about absolutes and you need to be able to read beyond the headline. the people that peddle anti-vax rhetoric seem to not understand the immense difference from a statistic like 0.01% and 1.0% - as an example. if you ever come across anyone that says that the side effects from a vaccine outweigh the risk of the disease it protects against they are full of fucking shit and are science-illiterate. we would not consider it an effective vaccine and it would not be used if this was ever the case. i know anti-vaxxers that think the hpv vaccine makes you infertile 50% of the time! totally not true at all and with a 90% reduction in hpv-related cancers? how stupid and dangerous is it to say that you shouldn't be vaccinated for it?  
  
yes - i should \"work\" on my gaslighting because i have no idea how to do it. one of us has the backing of 99% of the medical community of experts and the other has memes on facebook and discredited doctors/right-wing profiteers.  i often see anti-vax people hail their prowess as \"critical thinkers\" but if i was on your side of the argument it would become painfully apparent who exactly is being gas lit.   
  
listen - at the end of the day the people spouting this disinformation that you have picked up know what they are doing. they have given you trap doors to exit any argument i have; whether its \"appeal to authority fallacy\" or \"just because the vast majority of people believe something doesn't mean its true\" they make sure you're armed and ready. its part of how it works. yes i am very well-versed in conspiracy theories and the people that start them because i am genuinely curious how people believe things that are not true. seriously, you should checkout the podcast i recommended, they do an awesome job of explaining how this stuff spreads and how people get caught up in it. its always a good thing to hear opposing views. anyway - best of luck.",conservatives

canada needs more and better transit as an absolute first step to get people off bruning fuels. that's the first step here imo. getting off coal and other fossil fuels should be relatively easy* with the amount of hydro available here (not to forget opportunities for wind and wave power too, solar is difficult in the winter).

yes. the key thing is that there's a lot of federal liberal voters who vote for the bc ndp provincially. in some ways the federal liberals in bc are a coalition of bc ndp and bc liberal supporters, and we get along surprisingly well. (personally, i'm a provincial swing voter.)

&gt; the alberta ndp and the federal party get along fine these days.

yet they still haven't been able to reach a compromise position on tmx, which is a pretty fundamental issue for the alberta ndp (because it's a fundamental issue for alberta). even the lone federal ndp mp in alberta [supports tmx](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/alberta/article-albertas-lone-ndp-mp-supports-trans-mountain-expansion-despite-party/).

i don't think the alberta ndp is any happier about the leap manifesto [than in 2016](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-ndp-leap-manifesto-anger-1.3529980), and now avi lewis (co-author of the manifesto) is [running for the ndp in west vancouver](https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/film-producer-avi-lewis-named-as-federal-ndp-candidate-in-b-c-riding) - that's not going to be helpful for federal ndp candidates in alberta.

obviously tmx is much further along now, but even after the courts have ruled that it can proceed, protesters are still attempting to obstruct it, and the federal ndp and alberta ndp are still on opposite sides of this issue.

the report your talking about describes possible routes that mostly *bypass* the proposed highway. if your going from peterburough to niagra you arnt going to drive up north to do it, so it makes minimal differences. especially since most of the traffic on the naigra end is around the skyway and and that interchange between the 403, qew and 407. which the proposed 413 stops well short of. 

bu for people heading west and/or north (guelph or kitchener, for example) from toronto, it could make a huge difference. the same for non-400 linked cities along its route (georgetown, orangeville, etc), which could potentially see a large time savings going eastward. 

if you currently commute on the 401 or 403, the 413 probably isnt going to make a big difference unless your coming from somewhere like caledon, or heading up to somewhere like georgetown, where you can use it to skip the existing rush hour routes entirely. but for those that *would actually use it* it can save alot of time.

yes, because conservatives should always be for sale to the highest bidder.

&gt; the bill also increases the amount that parties can spend on a campaign. the ndp government capped campaign spending at $2 million in 2018 but a proposed new formula - $1.16 per voter - would raise that amount to about $3.27 million.

that way, conservatives that don't mind selling their influence can afford bigger campaigns as compared with other parties that can't or won't sell themselves to corporate or foreign interests. it gives the conservatives an advantage in getting elected.
