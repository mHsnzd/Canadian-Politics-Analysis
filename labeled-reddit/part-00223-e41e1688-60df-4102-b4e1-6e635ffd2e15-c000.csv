on top of that, erin has said some inadvisable things (regarding residential schools for example) which have ruined his first impression among 'social moderates'. he won on the 'anyone but peter' balloting process, which whittled out a regrettable sloan and a rising new social conservative star in leslyn lewis and fooled her supporters into thinking o'toole was the only way to stop the 'progressive' wing of the party. now that he's in power, he's back-tracked majorly. 

like, yeah, personally i think it's a good idea to acknowledge that the changing climate will be a problem and we, as a party, need to get with the times. that said, but i don't think that carbon taxes do anything to reduce consumption. rather, they just squeeze the lower classes harder. a conservative approach would be to support industry in coming up with new technologies which are less carbon intensive, not to punish families for driving their kids to school and grocery shopping! so, while our party has gone on about 'no carbon tax', o'toole plans to bring one in. it's a major concession, and one that (in my view) won't win over ontario or quebec voters.",conservatives

this point, which is directly quoted from the [conservative plan](https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07090434/5ea53c19b2e3597.pdf), is coded language for [ag-gag laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ag-gag). i'm basing that claim on the fact that other existing such laws, like in alberta and ontario, were also marketed as protecting family farms. also, in the last parliament session, a conservative mp put forward a private members bill which was a weaker version of the alberta and ontario laws and was supported by most conservative mps, including o'toole.

the laws are advertised around protecting farm families because that's politically unpopular to criticize. they're designed however to prevent conditions inside farms from being exposed to the public by things like prohibiting whistleblowers, and they're [lobbied for by large producers who have previously had poor animal treatment exposed by whistleblowers](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/maple-leaf-foods-animals-whistleblower_ca_5ef3a1e2c5b643f5b22e8078).

heg5zp9,2021-09-26T17:52:03.000-07:00,"liberals plan to make immigration to canada much easier. i'm fairly left but i think this is some common ground for canadians. neo-liberal policy (used by all the parties in some aspects frankly) use immigration as a stop gap because of 'falling birth rates' within country. i wholeheartedly argue however that the reason we have such drastically low birth rates' within country is because the cost of living for families continues to rise yearly. families can't get started until later (if they so choose) simply because it costs more and more to live and work near the larger cities. so instead of addressing the societal issues governments across the spectrum just bring in more bodies to pay into the tax base. 

immigration isn't inherently bad, and we should take in refugees to meet international needs and agreements but i strongly disagree with the governments using immigration as a method to offset the problems occuring within the country. additionally simply stating educated women have less children is incredibly reductionist and doesn't unpack the nuance whatsoever. for example a country like israel with relatively high education levels has a positive birth rate, while a country with lower levels of education such as mauritius has a lower birth rate than canada. the education of women is but one contribution to the lower birth rates and doesn't explain all of the variance observed. 

moving forward i hope to see a platform from one of the parties that can use the immigration issue and frame it in such a way that the gen pop doesn't just immediately react and scream xenophobia. more people (wealthier immigrants) using the investor visa pr that we offer absolutely will continue to impact the housing market making things worse and worse. bringing more people in who move to the metropolitan cities is only going to exacerbate these issues.",liberals

you want to enforce your value judgment on others! why do you think you have the moral objectivity to support this and do this? and yes, you are supporting it by advocating for it. you are giving cover to and support to the power of the state to hurt people.

i don't know how you don't see this tension. going after me for thinking i can see moral objectivity when you're enforcing your own moral objectivity and opinions onto others.

of course it's a matter of figuring out what's right and difference of opinion. but you're the one telling people to take off personally important perhaps foundationally important clothing in a cruel stigmatizing way because of your subjective option. my subjective option is maybe don't do that needless cruel thing.

at 5 billion for shutting down 450mw you're well on your way to paying the capital costs for nuclear/hydro the most capital intensive options out there. now if ns or any province wants to build something like that, or a big transmission project or whatever else i'd be happy for them to make a proposal and make the case for the feds chipping in and if you put a few projects together you might reach 5 billion in total contribution. as is this is reminiscent of kenny's similarly ridiculous ask for [30 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/ucp-federal-government-30-billion-carbon-capture-1.5941518) for carbon capture efforts.

hell in both those cases if they want to foist the entire bill on ottawa i think federal ownership of the grid operators should be in the cards and in both cases this would actually have some ancillary benefits. for the atlantic provinces it'd get all the operators into one house that'd have a whole lot more capital cushion to absorb hits like muskrat falls and would make centralization of efforts easier politically and financially. alberta managed to create a similar problem with their deregulated generation side and could use a unified generation+grid operator as well.",liberals

can you elaborate on what this good reason is? because aren't conservatives the ones who always complain about government interfering too much in their lives and say they value \"freedom.\" sure, conservatives say they are \"pro-life\" but none of their policies except abortion are truly pro-life (and even then they don't want to help the baby after it is born with free healthcare, paid leave, etc.). in general, i think left vs right ideology is more about if people should be equal or not. in my estimation, right-wingers would say it's every individual's choice whether to take covid precautions or not and left-wingers would say no one deserves to die of covid so we all have to live with restrictions. i suppose i'm talking more about \"traditional\" right-wing us-style conservatives than modern canadian-style centrist conservatives but even then we still have some conservatives in this country that would be more of the former.",conservatives
