&gt;&gt;let‚Äôs return to august 29th and the events that sparked this libelous charge against me. i helped organize a pro-palestinian rights demonstration at the head office of b‚Äônai brith canada because of b‚Äônai brith‚Äôs attack on the canadian union of postal workers (cupw). b‚Äônai brith targeted cupw because cupw supports the bds movement and has also expressed support for the palestinian postal services workers union.

&gt;&gt;the jewish defence league canada (jdl), a violent, anti-arab and islamophobic hate group, organized a counter-protest in support of b‚Äônai brith. faith goldy showed up at the jdl counter-protest and was greeted warmly by a number of the counter-protesters, including jdl boss meir weinstein.

&gt;&gt;immediately following our demonstration and the jdl counter-protest, two b‚Äônai brith supporters recorded and posted on facebook a video gushing over faith goldy. in that video, they called for the death penalty to be imposed on prime minister trudeau, certain liberal mps who are muslim and/or persons of colour, and ndp leader jagmeet singh, stating:

&gt;&gt;‚Äúi just think we should bring in the death penalty. and that would resolve a lot of problems‚Ä¶ justin trudeau, be the first one to go. i‚Äôd love to see him. and monsef. and iqra khalid. and ahmed hussein. and omar alghabra‚Ä¶ and singh, singh, let‚Äôs make him sing, you know, as he walks toward the gullotine!‚Äù

&gt;&gt;after i publicly exposed this heinous, racist, death-wish video, i called on b‚Äônai brith, the center for israel &amp; jewish affairs (cija) and liberal mps michael levitt and anthony housefather to denounce the video‚Äôs authors and faith goldy. they failed to do so.

&gt;&gt;after days of their silence, i tweeted ‚Äúapparently, liberal mps anthony housefather and michael levitt are more devoted to apartheid israel than to their own prime minister and colleagues in the liberal caucus.‚Äù

&gt;&gt;the ferocious reaction, in hindsight, was predictable, but i was admittedly na√Øve. cija and b‚Äônai brith deflected attention from the death threats against the prime minister and other mps and from the racism of supporters of israel, and screamed ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù at me because the mps i tweeted about were jewish.

&gt;&gt;to be sure, there are other canadian mps who are supportive of israel, but levitt and housefather are israel‚Äôs most outspoken defenders in canada‚Äôs parliament, and they do not hesitate to advertise themselves as such. they are also major supporters of b‚Äônai brith. in addition, promptly following the conclusion of our protest at b‚Äônai brith‚Äôs offices, levitt had specifically condemned our rally in support of cupw without once mentioning the presence of faith goldy or other hate-mongers at the jdl-organized counter-protest. shamefully, in may of this year, levitt and housefather criticized their own party leader, justin trudeau, for his mild rebuke of israel after an israeli sniper shot canadian doctor tarek loubani while loubani was attempting to treat unarmed gazans being shot by israeli snipers. these snipers have now murdered over 160 unarmed gazans in the past six months, including children, medics and journalists.

h8hi2g9,2021-08-10T12:00:35.000-07:00,"o‚Äôtoole‚Äôs conservative party fracturing on eve of a federal election there's not really any examples of (c)onservative policy, but that's because the modern conservative party has moved pretty far from (c)onservatism. i mean, sustainability, living within our ecological means, is inherently a (progressive) conservative position to hold. it's easy for me to understand why disenchanted (c)onservatives would consider voting green. 

we're a party of people who want a government that balances its budget and invests taxpayer money responsibly. we want a government that looks at long-term trends rather than the next 3 months or 4 years, that pays attention to the lessons we've learned from the past and applies them to our current problems. all of the spending/revenue policies we're pushing forward stem from those priorities on long-term thinking and responsible investments.

we support protecting our food security and becoming more self-reliant, investing in our rural communities and infrastructure, careful stewardship of our natural resources so we don't waste them. we support stable funding for municipalities to support decision-making at the local community level, instead of ottawa arbitrarily deciding what the rest of the country needs every time they want to hand out a pile of cash. we support investments in preventive care to save our healthcare system money, and investments in senior care so our seniors can live in their communities as long as possible. there are plenty of things that progressives and conservatives should be able to agree on- and we used to have a party willing to explicitly call itself progressive conservative because of that.

again, it's important to remember that conservatives today don't really have that much resemblance to small-c conservatism. small-c conservatism is about protecting the social and physical structures we've built, about protecting families and society in a changing world. it's about not spending beyond our means. but the policies of today's conservative party will destabilize our society and put canadians at risk. the green party is about planning for our long-term future, not just the next 4 years. it's about responsible investment in our infrastructure and careful stewardship of our resources- so that both will be around when our grandchildren have to make their own decisions. that's an alignment and attitude that resonates with small-c conservatives.

remember, sustainability used to be called conservation- protecting the environment we live in from being squandered for short-term profits. farmers understand that need. retirees understand that need. immigrants understand that need. the progressive conservatives used to understand that need. the modern conservative party no longer seems to, and its voters who still do need a family to come home to.",conservatives

&gt; on the day australia closed its borders to china, canada had four confirmed covid-19 cases, all linked to travel from china. at the time, the trudeau government was **still committed to the idea that travel bans don't work and even suggested that those proposing them might be racist.**
&gt;
&gt; on february 3, the u.s. followed australia's lead and froze travel with china. **asked in the commons why canada was not doing the same, hajdu denounced \"the spread of misinformation and fear across canadian society\" and called on the opposition to \"not sensationalize the risk to canadians.\"**
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; \"[the world health organization] advises against any kind of travel and trade restrictions, saying that they are inappropriate and could actually cause more harm than good in terms of our global effort to contain,\" theresa tam, canada's chief public health officer, said on feb. 3.
&gt; 
&gt; the government has been accused of being too subservient to a who that was advising against border closures at the start of the epidemic. **its actions may also reflect an internal conflict between ideology and epidemiology.**
&gt; 
&gt; in february, hajdu told cbc news **she feared covid-19 would provoke racist reactions.**

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5619705

hadju, in particular, claimed several times that the threat of fuelling racist stigma is worse than the virus. in hindsight it's not only wrong it's downright surreal.

h3ral7s,2021-07-01T12:23:22.000-07:00,"all parties get to wear the failure to ban conversion therapy in canada while the cpc delay tactics were part of it, the government is by no means absolved of responsibility here. for starters, the government is responsible for the effects of prorogation which pushed back the legislative agenda since everything needs to be re-introduced and it reset legislative debate. the bill was re-introduced as c-6 on oct 1st, which is almost 2 weeks after parliament resumed after prorogation. introducing bills takes 15 seconds and the government is free to do so on any day they wish, cpc delay tactics don't factor in there.

the government also sets the debate calendar on the vast majority of days; they also choose when opposition gets the opposition days they're entitled to within a budget cycle. it wasn't until oct 26th where the government chose to have the first debate and it was sent to committee 3 days after, that has nothing to do with cpc delays.

the committee that studied it reported it back to to the house in december, where it remained silent from the legislative agenda until april 16th, then it took. month and a half to have another day of debate.

the government chooses what they want to prioritize and looking at the legislative calendar, c-6 doesn't look like a priority as it kept getting bumped by other things. an easy way to ensure very little passes is to try and start debate on a lot of bills at once but not actually seeing them through. that is something that is entirely in the government's hands. the digital charter bill c-11 (digital charter), c-19 (elections act) and c-22 (justice bill) all had debate days allocated to them prior to c-6 coming back and none of them went to the senate, since they had too many things on the go to allocate enough days pass any of them. if you really want to pass something, you can line it up for all the debate to happen at once rather than start a number of new things that have no chance in passing. if you aren't fond of c-10, its worth noting that even that had debate days prioritized before c-6 came back.

again, while conservatives can slow things down, they still have their limits on how much they can and the government still has full control over what bills to prioritize debate on. if they wanted to c-6 pass sooner they could have not scheduled most of the debate on it in june when it could have been debated as early as january.",conservatives

...so you‚Äôre admitting that your comment was a non-sequitur then?

the topic was the online harms bill. if what you wanted to say had nothing to do with the online harms bill, what exactly were you saying?

&gt;for starters - yeah, i do think that i need to give the government some power to regulate big tech. there is a power vacuum otherwise that big tech will fill, and i'm not okay with my access to information being in service of google's profits. i can't understand why everyone is so afraid of having a more balanced approach to information. we have it in broadcasting, manufacturing, and basically every commercial aspect of society. i'm not proposing that we change google.com to \"govtech.gov.ca.\" but people go into apoplectic fits whenever anyone mentions dealing with google in any legislative fashion.

holy moly, chill with the strawmen, halloween‚Äôs over.

is anyone saying ‚Äúall regulation is bad‚Äù? is anyone saying ‚Äúgoogle should be able to control your access to information‚Äù? the point is that this legislation does *absolutely nothing* to combat that - google can still block and censor anything they like, all it does is give the government overreaching power to censor as well.

&gt;let me outline what my main points were -

&gt; i don't trust google to comment on this type of thing in good faith.

&gt; i think that google should be subject to antitrust regulation and more general regulations to remove their incredible influence on the internet.

you don‚Äôt have to trust google to realize they‚Äôre right on this issue. the outline of the bill is public, feel free to read it yourself.

as for ‚Äúgeneral regulations‚Äù, sure, but that has nothing to so with this particular bill - so yeah, a non-sequitur.

that's not really true a lot of [studies](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/sr15_chapter2_low_res.pdf) tend to argue that carbon taxes and performance standard guidelines on their own are enough to meet paris climate targets on their own based on the data/evidence.

&gt;there‚Äôs not truth to the idea that the opposition is bollocking any climate policy federally.

before o'toole the cpc has ran on repealing the carbon tax as their main policy for most of the past 5-6 years.

&gt;cities with smart growth and green belt have ver unaffordable housing. the truth is cities that sprawl have cheaper housing.

sprawl doesn't equate more affordable housing. if denser housing is combined with a removal of supply restrictions it translates to significantly lower housing prices. philadelphia is less than half the size of calgary (367km compared to calgary's 825km), yet it's housing is 2x less expensive.

the evidence on home prices shows the biggest impacts to housing affordability are restrictions on housing supply and the type of housing that can be built. if you only allow detached single-family homes to be built, your city is basically pricing younger &amp; lower income people out of the housing/rental market), but regardless if supply is constrained, prices go up.",conservatives

that's been my understanding of quebec's politics for a while now, and the years the cpc does well in qc are the years the bloc does poorly. 

and stopping the liberals has a lot to do with stopping them in qc while keeping a lot of seats there as well. 

harper held power in 2008 and 2011 in part because the bloc lost a lot of their seats to either cpc candidates or someone other than the liberals. 

right now the poll predictions show the cpc in the strongest position on aggregators when the bloc does poorly. so this year reflects the recent past in that the cpc taking bloc seats is good for them and the bloc being strong is bad for them.

as it is right now, private developers want to build for the middle-class and the middle-class wants to pay out of their own pockets, except the supply is not coming through at the necessary scale. governments shouldn't be inducing scarcity among a demographic that wants to pay their own way such that they're bringing housing insecurity to a lot of people that shouldn't be.

skyrocketing rents and the renoviction epidemic are a function of the middle-class being squeezed out  hard, such that they're pursuing housing that would typically be affordable for the poor, and in turn squeeze them into rooms, moving out of town or the streets. vacancy rates have been rock-bottom for years now, and many landlords have stories of literal hundreds of applicants for market-rate units nowadays. 

in bc, vacant and occupied purpose-built rentals had about the same average rent in 2015, or \\~$1100. as of 2021, vacant rentals average $1800 and occupied units $1500. it's not a coincidence trudeau's government began in 2015, because that's when immigration increased and tourism/international education demand in particular got turbocharged - but very few cities ever plan housing around these things.",liberals

black says it's not due to systemic racism then gives a litany of explanations (masquerading as excuses) of why things turned out the way it did while making everyone blameless.

&gt;if the british governor, sir guy carleton, had not succeeded, after four years of lobbying, in gaining adoption of the qu√©bec act by the british parliament in 1774, the french canadians would have accepted the invitation of george washington and benjamin franklin (who was sent packing from montreal), to join the americans. in either scenario, the indigenous peoples of canada would have had a much more difficult time with the american government than they have had with canada.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;a few utterances of colonial and canadian officials can be removed from context and magnified to indicate fundamental hostility to the natives, but the principal attitude of successive authorities in canada to indigenous people was patronizing, feckless, ill-considered, and generally ineffectual benignity.

remember that if you have 3 ridings and you poll 100 percent in one but 40 percent in the others, your 'national' number is still 60 percent vs 40 for the other guy, but you'll only win 1 of the 3 ridings. 

i feel like their cpc numbers are a little high for whatever reason but their seat count is probably fairly close. it all boils down to the same thing, the cpc need that breakout in ontario and it would be nice if they could reduce the lib numbers in bc. firming up a few extra seats in quebec would help too.

whataboutism is when you're comparing apples to oranges and trying to one up one another.

this current situation is quite literally canada admitting that we're done the exact horrid things, but trudeau saying we hold the moral high ground because ours have stopped.

the reality is that no one has the moral high ground and its just gonna be a pissing contest to see who can yell the loudest. canada has thus far made no tangible changes like reparations. it is the same now as it was a year ago. wait till we actually take some action before drinking the coolaid on this one here.",liberals

paul and atwin never spoke on the matter.  probably because there was no need.  atwin had already put a bullshit facade up in order to justify why she just 'had to leave.'
