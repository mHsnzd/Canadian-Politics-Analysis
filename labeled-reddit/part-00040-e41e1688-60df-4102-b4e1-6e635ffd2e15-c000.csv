you had right wing authors predicting the complete collapse of the lpc after their first third place finish ever. the lpc is older than the country itself. 

the cpc would not be old enough to vote. it’s a fracturing party that’s on a downward trend. a party with an unpopular leader, no policy ideas to speak of and deep unbreakable connections to absolutely detested provincial politicians. oh and also the same slogan that was used to justify it’s creation is a slogan that was recently used by terrorists.  the idea that it finishes third place in one of the next few elections is not only not irrational, its the opposite. the idea that a party that young being inevitably first or second is insanely illogical. the fact is, that the cpc has only been in six elections... and the party is more likely to collapse than win second place in six more in a row. so you’re either assuming the inevitability of victory of the youngest party which has only ever been able to win whilst being led by it’s founder and while it’s greatest challenger was on in the midst of epic once in a century scandal (both in terms of scale and the fact that it was only possible due to the separatist movements once in a century strength). or... your assuming that the majority of canadian history where there were two right wing parties is not indicative of anything and the cpc lasting forever in second place or victorious is inevitable.

i press [x] to doubt. if the cpc doesn’t win in the next few cycles it will be replaced by another party. that’s literally what all of canadian history demonstrates. the ndp has sixty years of contesting elections... the cpc has six elections. the inevitability of one being in the top two and not the other is laughable. history is littered with examples of political parties that only last a couple decades.",liberals

yes, the federal government could do what it does with healthcare, i.e. mandate provincially-administered paid sick leave, using federal transfers for leverage to make the provinces comply. yes this is a tool in the federal toolbox, and yes they could do it.

here's my problem with ford's stance though - he's passing on his government's responsibility to another government for no apparent reason. is he saying ontario can't afford it? no, he says the province can fund the increased costs. does he think it's not constitutional? he should know that it is, since he canceled paid sick leave that ontario already had. so why try to get the federal government involved at all?

now of course this is exactly what the liberals want, they don't just want ndp or gpc voters in narrow cpc-lpc ridings to vote for them out of fear. they want voters in ndp-lpc marginals to vote for them, hell they want voters in cpc-ndp marginals to vote for them without having to convince those voters using policy. the number of liberal candidates in cpc-ndp marginals i saw posting national numbers on their social media was astounding. no attempt to convince voters in their riding to take a chance on them, just misleading fear mongering to convince less engaged voters that the ndp is a wasted vote. the party apparatus would rather the cpc have more seats than the ndp win those cpc-ndp marginals.

there are plenty of people in the gta who vote liberal who say they prefer the ndp and their plans, but only vote liberal. which is why i think the ndp really blew an opportunity here because they were polling at 21-24% and really could have made a move that would have made a lot of those scared less engaged voters tell themselves \"hey the ndp isn't a wasted vote\".

edit: ndpers are also unwittingly feeding in to this because constant abcing drags down ndp national numbers, which in turn makes it harder to convince voters and increases the likelihood of voters coming to the conclusion, \"well the ndp is a wasted vote\". even if said conclusion makes 0 sense in their riding.

edit 2: liberal partisans in ndp-lpc races will often tell people that voting ndp here would risk the cpc coming up the middle. of course the data doesn't really show that being possible. if the cpc comes up the middle in those ridings, then they're doing extremely well and are going to get a large majority anyways.

edit 3: and in the case of tight 3 way races, the dominant strategic voting rhetoric pushes the liberals as the natural governing party. making it harder for the ndp to win those races. even when 20-30% of the people who voted for the lpc in those races prefer the ndp.",liberals

* implemented everything suggested in the 2016 [external review into sexual misconduct and sexual harassment in the canadian armed forces](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/sexual-misbehaviour/external-review-2015.html), including establishing an independent agency for reporting misconduct

* sidelined the cds immediately after substantive allegations were brought forward in 2018.

* once it was found that the defense minister let down members of the caf by covering for the cds and lied to parliment, the minister swiftly apologized and was removed from cabinet.

* once it was found that the pmo's staffers and the defense ministrr knew about the situation and never told him, the pm went in front of canadians and apologized for his failure to ensure he knew what was happening with canada's top soldier.

oh wait, exactly none of that has been done.

instead, the minister who lied to parliment and covered for vance is still the minister.

the pmo knew about the allegations and knew they were of a sexual nature, but chose to do nothing. *allegedly* the pmo knew the allegations involving the most powerful soldier in the country and didn't tell the pm. how believable that is, i'll let you decide.

instead of doing anything, trudeau's government presented their highest-profile woman who is wildly not involved in this debacle to apologize \"as a woman\", and then say she had complete confidence in the powerful men involved.

in your opinion, is using women as props to protect powerful men who were covering up sexual misconduct consistent with being a feminist?

also, can you advise how the tories sat on the allegations that were brought up in 2018? weren't the liberals in power then? or am i mistaken? 

if i recall, the previous allegations involved vance dating his wife who was a lower rank but under a different command. it was cleared by the caf and usaf.

to me, it almost seems like you're trying to confuse people with two different cases of greatly different severity in an attempt to distract the conversation away from this government's coverup. 

was that the intent? if it wasn't, my apologies. but it certainly comes off that way.",liberals

[the us has an international reputation for breaking their promises, treaties, and agreements](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/01/politics/nuclear-treaty-trump/index.html).  [the us has a terrible international reputation](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/17/international-relations-experts-and-u-s-public-agree-america-is-less-respected-globally/).  i for one am glad canada has taken a route that differs from the us and [the trudeau government has taken the position](https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/reflections%20series%20paper%20no.18_luton.pdf) that we, unlike the us, honour our agreements.  comparing us to the us does not strengthen the argument for us to break our word.  we would be no better than them.
2. our government is in a conflict with china due to the legal detainment of meng wanzhou, and [our position that backs her detainment is that we honour our treaties](https://globalnews.ca/news/7472391/meng-wanzhou-arrest-justin-trudeau/).  if we break faith with another nation then china can use that against us in our conflict.
3. the saudi arms deal was wrong and never should have been made by the harper government in the first place.  we knew long before that agreement [the saudi's fund terrorist organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state-sponsored_terrorism#saudi_arabia), even [before their involvement in 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alleged_saudi_role_in_september_11_attacks).  yet the agreement was made.  while the agreement breaks no canadian or international laws, whatever damage was made to canada's reputation for signing the deal happened then.  cancelling the deal won't magically make the fact that we willingly agreed to sell arms to a known terror supporting state.  the damage is already done.
4. cancelling the deal has consequences.  reportedly [we would have to pay the saudi's billions in compensation](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/penalty-for-cancelling-saudi-arms-contract-in-the-billions-trudeau-1.4150003), so i ask you which is worse, selling arms to a known terror funding state, or giving them billions which they will use to fund terror organizations?  i say they are both equally bad.  so we are damned if we do, damned if we don't, but doubly damned if we don't as now china and other states we have conflict with can point to how we break our word, and therefore cannot be trusted.
5. i have never brought up the point about the financial and job benefits from this deal during a global economy slowdown due to a global pandemic, which i guess, can be used as another reason to continue with the agreement, because i don't believe it should factor into the argument at all.  if it wouldn't be a security threat to our sovereignty i would say to hell with the entire canadian arms manufacturing sector.  what does matter is our reputation, our international standing, and whether we want to be oath breakers like the us, or that our word is our bond.

let me be very frank.  i want nothing more than to stop the agreement with the saudi's.  hell i would love for canada to have absolutely nothing to do with the saudi state at all....  i see this \"crime\" as being committed by the harper government not the trudeau government, and i understand the whole mess is terribly complicated and cannot simply be fixed by cancelling the deal, as cancelling the deal will have major international repercussions on our standings in the world, and cancelling will still mean canada gives billions to the saudi's to continue funding their terror programs.  we are in a no-win situation with this deal, and come next election everyone should remember which party put us in this situation, the pc's.",liberals

gqkmkh0,2021-03-10T21:57:11.000-08:00,"doug ford says he’s ‘proud’ of controversial mzos to fast-track development &gt;“it’s no longer just that young people can’t afford housing, it’s everyone. we want more houses out there, more condominiums, more townhouses to make sure that people can afford it,” said ford, lashing out at the new democrats for opposing the progressive conservatives’ moves.

&gt;“there are 40,000 people moving in the gta, fastest-growing region in north america. if it was up to them, they’d be living in mud huts right now,” he told the legislature.

&gt;“we will never stop issuing [ministerial zoning orders] for the people of ontario, the people that need housing.”

housing we do need. what we do not need, mr. ford, is more suburbs. not only are they ecological disasters (even when not built on protected wetlands) but they're also fiscally inefficient. suburbs increase the cost to local services at a higher rate than they draw in with tax dollars. nothing specific against the people who live in suburbs but rather the fact that a suburb requires more road, power line, and pipe per taxpayer than a dense neighborhood. not to mention the decreased efficiency of public transit, if they bother to run transit out to the suburbs at all.  

of course the downside to density is that developers have to wait a while to get a return on their medium density housing (whether they manage it their selves or sell it to a landlord) whereas you can quickly slap together a single detached house on the cheap (compared to a medium or high density property), sell it immediately to some poor schmuck desperately trying to get into the housing market for three times what it's worth, and take your profits immediately in hand. 

if this truly was about taking drastic action to alleviate the housing crisis then why not use the mzos to upzone the residential-detached areas of toronto to at least semi detached or townhomes? of course this does involve telling the people and city council of toronto to go fuck themselves but come on doug, you love telling toronto to go fuck themselves. you've done it for no reason other than the personal satisfaction so why not get one last hit of that sweet petty revenge while making a positive change at the same time?

oh right, that's because his developer buddies can't make as big or as quick of a buck on density as they can sprawl. ah well, who needs wetlands anyway? aside from, you know, the environment.",conservatives

h23t4w2,2021-06-17T02:24:49.000-07:00,"is it hypocritical for the liberals to put the brakes on coal but not on natural gas? something to keep in mind: as of 2019, coal, oil and natural gas provide about 84% of the world's total energy (including fuel use, not just electricity)

* oil - 33%
* coal - 27%
* natural gas - 24%
* renewables - 12% (including hydro, wind, solar and biofuels)
* nuclear - 4%

[https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix)

that can and *must* change, but we're not going to eliminate and replace 84% of the world's energy supply in a short period of time - it's going to be a transition over a few decades at minimum.

in the meantime, people expect reliable access to energy: for electricity, for transportation, to heat their buildings...

so it first makes sense to focus on phasing out the most polluting fuels (coal), and replacing the fossil fuel-burning machines that have good alternatives available (e.g. coal power plants and gas-powered cars).

and we can continue developing, improving, and deploying alternatives to other uses of fossil fuels (e.g. freight vehicles, natural gas power, home heating, industrial heat...).

but it would be a mistake to think we can get off natural gas right away. many people still rely on it to heat their homes, and in some regions it can help with phasing out coal from electricity more quickly.

for example, natural gas is a big reason why alberta now plans to be coal-free by 2023, ahead of the 2030 deadline (they're converting some coal plants to run on natural gas).  over the long-term, renewables will supply bigger share of alberta's electricity, but natural gas is an easy and quick replacement.

over the longer term, we do need to look at how to reduce/replace natural gas usage (or at least combustion), by switching to using more electricity or hydrogen.  as the environment minister says in the article, there is potential to extract hydrogen (h2) from natural gas (ch4) while capturing the carbon, thus using the energy but avoiding the co2 emissions.

&gt;“there is almost no use of thermal coal without significant carbon emissions,” he said. **“there are ways, potentially in the future, to use natural gas without carbon emissions — (for example) by extracting hydrogen and using the energy value of that without carbon pollution**. and so there’s lot of different work that’s being done with respecting pathways. but the ultimate end goal is the pathway has to be net zero by 2050.”",liberals

ca re as a % of gdp growth has been growing over the years. even if it reverted back to the mean, ca would be in a huge recession for many years.

the boc and the federal government initially funneled that money to prevent housing from collapsing, because they couldn't afford for it to collapse or even correct. but what they missed (as did everyone) is covid was discriminatory in its recession and a large % of those that owned homes weren't affected much by it. so they essentially put fuel on the fire. rather than attempt to walk it back, they realized they were driving solid growth from ca re, which they desperately needed (as they said), so they didn't turn off the tap.

true, just as quebec will have to respect canadian law that treat quebec as a province. all this will need to be renogatiated. everything becomes posisble in these negotiations, even the status quo. the cree now have joint governance over the entire territory and it will be very difficult to take this territory out of canada without their consent. they have documented a local system of governance that assigns traditional hunting grounds to each cree family to show that they maintain continued use of all the land so that they can go into the next round of land claims negotiations to assume even more sovereign rights over the land

 if there is a dispute, it could last a very, very long time. they have already claimed they will remain in canada,and this will have to be respected.

remember, this territory belonged to canada before canada gave it to quebec to administer in 1898 and 1912. as such, the cree, naskapi, and inuit will get final say on the matter as all these acts were carried under colonialist coercion, as were all  treaties signed with quebec. these are to be seen as steps in the decolonizing process as opposed to permanent settlements. they have by no means gven up on claims to the entire territory, and they govern all  of the territory outside a few quebecois colonial settlements like chibougamau and radisson jointly with the provincial government. quebec soveriegny will merely accelerate the decolonization precess, and you'll see them get a territory or province of their own such as nunuvut, which remains the gold standard for landclaims settlement in canada.

to see what they think, listen to what mathew-coon-come has to say:

[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/coon-come-fights-separatists](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/coon-come-fights-separatists)

h96itxl,2021-08-16T03:21:57.000-07:00,"tom mulcair: trudeau has bet everything on securing a majority i don't really think either of the two 'issues' that mulcair brought up are really at the forefront of canadian's minds. and, to be honest, both issues feel like they're a bit suspect in their presentation here. 

take the afghanistan situation, for example. i don't think anyone is going to look at the situation there and think the outcome is good. part of it boils down to the fact that i don't think many in the west really anticipated just how pathetic the afghan government was-- or that biden would continue the moronic policy of trump to withdraw from afghanistan even though it was clear that the afghan government needed us support to exist. 

but this is something of an albatross here because, let's be clear, the only solution that would have stopped this offensive is if us and its allies like canada continually occupied the country. is this really what mulcair is advocating here, for this 20 year old war to continue? you can argue that more should have been done to airlift supporters (translators, etc) to safety, but as i indicated, i don't think anyone realistically thought that the afghan government would implode quite so quickly. 

the second issue he brings up is the glyphosate thing; he describes the situation, apparently without irony, as a mad scramble to figure out what to do because the agency in question is supposed to operate at an arm's length from the canadian government. i'm getting echoes of singh's demand for a constitutional crisis rather than an election being called here. if the agency is at arm's length, and deliberately so, you shouldn't want the government to step in and rewrite the rules because they've come up with something you don't like. this sort of political interference in independent agencies is the very thing that ends up corrupting and debasing those agencies to start with. 

imagine it was the other way around; imagine this agency was holding a public consultation on restricting the use of the chemical and a cpc led government-- on the complaints of farmers-- swept in and decided to overturn or otherwise interfere to benefit those voters. you wouldn't want that. you'd want this agency to be making decisions independently as much as possible, and based on as good of science (in this case) as possible. 

and i'm not even saying they're making the right decision here, or that i'm agreeing with the plan. what i'm getting at is that this is not a lever the government has. developing a lever in this case (or any case) strikes me as the sort of thing that you'd want to carefully consider and develop, rather than normalize the idea that \"independent from the government\" is just a nice phrase on paper with no actual meaning or power.",liberals

the liberal plan means they can get a minimum wage job, pay $10/day ($220/month), pay income taxes, and still have more money than they had on social assistance. this improves their resume and gets them job experience so when their kids are old enough to go to school, they are well established in their job and may even have been able to move up to a better paying job due to the job experience they gained.

this type of thing has so much area to be abused, it's absurd. who decides what is and is not ok and what line of the sand it falls on, threat or opinion? there are obvious cases like saying \"i want to kill [name]\" and \"i hate [name]\" but there is so much gray area in between that can easily be abused if mandated for a pal. for instance \"fuck [name] hope he dies\" or \"i hope [name] gets [injury]\". are those threats or are they someone voicing their awful opinion? someone is going to have to make those calls, i will never trust someone to make those calls because their inherent biases will lead them one way or another. if they are threats, and the reviewer has a bias against the person being threatened, maybe they take the opinion route and thus fail to stop the threat. if they are opinions, and the review is bias towards the person being threatened, then they could destroy someone's life who would have done nothing and was just pissed off.

del duca's perception is impacted by the baggage of the liberal party. they've had years of scandals, bad press and poor choices and really needed a fresh face to galvanize the party, bring energy and fresh ideas and provide a real alternative. del duca doesn't tick those boxes, and his personality again comes off as rather bland to mainstream voters, again with the idea that people tend to feel he wouldn't make a good premier.

contrast with ford, who's had numerous scandals and missteps. the thing typical people take away is that his language and actions **appear to be** substantive action to help people. mainstream ford supporters are more likely to feel that he hears their problems and speaks the right words about helping, even his policies are not as good. and while he has made blunders with the covid response, people generally seem to think he's done a decent job (the bar is so low but in ontario that's always been the case). 

so to summarize - electability in ontario is less about policy and ideas, and more about the charisma, emotional connection and perception of the leader as a viable premier. it's also about the idea of someone being unencumbered by  baggage from previous incidents or party actions. at the end of the day, people want to feel heard, and they want the premier to appear like he/she is taking action, even if said person doesn't really do that in practice.",liberals

gpzfhns,2021-03-06T01:04:13.000-08:00,"will the conservative party reopen its abortion policy debate? social conservatives are trying not sure what real conservatism means. people call or say that when they are part of that part of the conservative side of the spectrum in various quarters. a moderate conservative might call themselves a real conservative while another who is libertarian or right wing populist hard to tell these days will say they are. it is really in the eyes of the beholder.

a conservative in canadian tradition prior to the merger who called themselves a \"tory\" meant that you wanted to preserve what was best in society so therefore you had a socially progressive wing and being fiscally conservative at the same time.

therefore, to be a conservative in canada prior to 2003-04, you were basically liberal conservative and that went for whether you were blue tory or red tory. mulroney was a blue tory but still believed in social liberalism and being centre-right. he was more hardline on fiscal conservatism. that was the varying degree.

nowadays being blue tory means being for populist conservatism. it means you also reject abortion, and are for a smaller government. it also means sometimes white supremacy and conspiracy theories.

red toryism meant or is close to blue liberalism so it means you want a conservative welfare state and want to keep social programs and keep society egalitarian and believe in a strong central government on the conservative side. it is paternalistic conservatism.

of course, after the merger, red toryism also included privatization, smaller government and less focus on social programs and more focus on decentralization and giving more powers to provinces.

that is where the old pc party differs with today's conservatives.

so to answer that question about social liberalism mixed with economically right people, i believe the conservative party in its constitution is for social progressive policies but it is diluted by so many factions now the party is simply a jumble and the extreme elements have taken over the party as clark warned about.

he wanted the new conservative party to be mainly red tory.

to me that would have been the better option. as someone in the middle, i feel that canada needs not the ppc but rather a party that is like in ireland which has a centre/centre-right option i would vie for that.",conservatives

the point isn't let not do wind or solar or hydro.  its let do them all, because they all have a use.  if we want to convert every vehicle into electric that's going to raise the electricity demand substantially.  the same goes with energy intensive methods of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere, separating water so we can use hydrogen as fuel for other uses.

the reality is the greens and the ndp are onboard the dealing with climate change plan right until nuclear is mentioned.  they want to ignore the biggest possible source of energy humanity has at its fingertips.  until the greens and ndp change on that file and others, there is zero point voting for them because its clear they are not serious on the climate file.  the other parties have their own problems on the climate front, but at least they are pro nuclear and not being held back by the ultra leftwing/progressive activists.",conservatives

the former seems more than a little inconsistent with day-to-day experience (the ndp tends to beat the other parties in terms of candidate diversity). 

the latter is complex because people are also complex. having some socially-conservative views doesn't necessarily mean you're against the carbon tax. wanting a deregulated economy doesn't mean you are willing to overlook policing and criminal justice policies that harm your community. but even to the extent it's true, it's not some new force that's going to tip the scales. appealing to conservative ethnic communities is part of how harper won, so at this point, it's baked-in.",liberals

not even a little bit. we heard the same nonsense in 2002. wasn't true then, isn't true now. sorry - obviously you were hoping for something different. but no. the vast majority of them aren't single issue voters anyway. they may wish that others agreed with them on abortion and the like but they will be happy that the cpc is fiscally responsible. they will prefer the cpc's targeted immigration vs the open door policy. they will appreciate that the cpc won't pass laws that ban people from having 'bad opinons ' online like the libs are about to. etc etc. 

&gt;yeah, i've thought about it and i can't see any way for the right to hold power in this country without being united under one tent. 

the answer is to abandon the far right and move to the center-center left and pick up some of those voters who aren't ok with how left the libs have gone. this is a successful strategy, but it is not desirable especially for those of us who are right of center fiscally and such. 

&gt;they don't have the numbers, if another right leaning party becomes popular enough, they will never be able to get enough votes to hold power.

see above. they used such tactics to hold power in the past, which is why the libs moved to the right to try to counter that in the 90's. the've moved far to the left right now to capture the ndp's vote (who was breathing down their neck in layton's day as you'll recall) and get the cancel culture sjw's on their side. that's left a gap which could be exploited. 

however - the other winning tactic is to focus on fiscal conservative policy and social libertarian policy.  a lot of people are uncomfortable with cancel culture and with the divisions right now. there is also a feeling in some provinces that the feds are putting too much on them and they should be free to pursue their own interests, so adding that as a policy as well can gain voters (the federal cpc has no interest in telling quebecquois how to be quebecquis!! do you agree quebec? or alberta etc)

&gt; looking at other countries, what seems to happen is that the ar-15 and equivalents are legal until there's some horrific shooting (port arthur in australia, christchurch in new zealand), and then they're prohibited. i expect the same thing would happen here in the wake of a mass shooting that's bad enough. but do we really need to wait for that to happen? 

shooting in nz

* nz regulate gun based on it looks rather than function or cartridge type for example if you want to purchase ruger 10//22 with pistol-grip then you need to get e-cat license(most restrict long-gun license in nz) while ar-15 that shoot .223 but with non-pistol grip or less tactical you could get them with a-cat license(basic firearm license in nz) chch's shooter use a-cat ar-15.
* nz does not require a firearm license for the magazine, which mean if you can buy 60 rds p-mag for your a-cat ar-15 easily without a firearm license and it's illegal to put a magazine that holds more than 7 rounds for centerfire on an a-cat firearm unless you have an e-cat license which is basically loophole in nz laws. chch's shooter uses 30 rounds of p-mags and 60 rounds of p-mags.
* nz allows the foreigner to purchase a gun in nz. even, gun friendly in the us, switzerland, if you want to purchase a gun in those nations you must be a temporary or permanent resident aka. green cardholder. chch's shooter is an australian.

now, you can own semi-auto ar or ak in nz but it must be rimfire.

for the nz case, jacinda arden could pass new gun control without a ban but rewrite them and regulate them based on 

* function(semi-auto and non-semi)
* cartridge-types (rimfire, centerfire, shotgun)
* magazine capacity (require a license based on magazine capacity). 

despite, the gun buyback there is a low rate of compliance or she could choose mean put all semi-auto rifle centerfire with detachable magazine and high capacity magazine to e-category.

&gt; we don't want to end up like the us, where the gun culture has become so strong and so enthusiastic that it was impossible to ban the ar-15 even after 20 first-grade students were shot and killed at sandy hook. (the issue is political rather than legal; the us banned the ar-15 and equivalents for 10 years, from 1994 to 2004.) 

i agree that the us should implement new gun control laws like licenses, etc. that effective but not ban them. 

since clinton signed awb in 1994-2004 federal assault weapon ban just bans guns based on [furniture](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a043384e4b6ed5443c0c72c2bf30b5ce). ar-15 and ak-47 still newly made during 10 years of ban between 1994-2004",liberals
