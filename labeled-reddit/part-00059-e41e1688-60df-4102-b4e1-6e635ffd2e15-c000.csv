(no party will risk provoking canadians’ ire by triggering another quick election.) 

if he didn’t call this election in august, one would have likely been called or triggered within a number of months. (historically, most minority governments survive for 18 months at most—from that standpoint, this recent election was *later* than typical.)

also: i think an election gives people a chance to decide who they want in charge. if the people say ‘same as before’, that’s still useful—it gives the government a new mandate and the moral authority to pursue its stated plan. and it’s the people’s right to say ‘same as before’, ‘new government’, or anything in between. all possible outcomes are equally valid. imho.",liberals

the onus was on trudeau to show why we needed an election and the results reinforce how pointless it was. stalling the growth of the liberal party is a win as far as the ndp should be concerned. the liberals come out of this with a population who are increasingly cynical about them. their cabinet was weak with a ton of baggage going into the election as well. they may have lost a few of the weaker ministers but plenty remain without many new faces to strengthen the table, and i suspect the liberals are going to be in a rough spot going into the next election, especially with a lot of serious economic issues that will likely get worse in the coming years.",liberals

how exactly? you're highlighting risk factors by group type, not by behavior. indigenous is a group type. what if a gay man isnt having penetrative sex? what if a hetro couple enjoys anal sex? you're highlighting my point, behaviors are whats important, not group affiliation. 

&gt; hence having an indigenous background is not a useful category for deciding whether one has a sufficiently high risk of tti incidence.

so again, behavior matters, not group affiliation. got it. 

&gt; but back to the main problem here: \"msm who claim to be monogamous.\" first, one partner cannot vouch for the other. so imagine that we bring in the couple. we ask each one separately, \"are you fully monogamous?\" if one confidentially tells the healthcare worker, \"no\", you have to deny the other from donating. in which case, you will have revealed to the other that he is being cheated on. hence one cannot get an honest answer from the partner and there are incentives against getting an honest answer.

how is this restricted to msm, additionally this doesnt address that users question about a demonstrated link, just assumptions about the gay community. 

&gt; okay, fourth time that you're trying to make me out to be a straw man and construing things that i have not said.

i'm literally quoting you, so maybe analyze how you've chosen to articulate yourself. when you disingenuously frame the argument you're making as opponents look to 'seek validation', that screams homophobia. when you infantize the concerns of an effected group, it generally is an example of implicit bias. additionally you havent even address my argument of why you'd come across this way (further regarding the krever report), so its kind of telling that you'd rather just deny rather then explain how i incorrectly interpreted your words, considering you had no problem addressing the other things i've said, if inconclusively.",liberals

i would suggest stepping away from such blunt terms as \"gay sex\". not only is that emotionally charged, it's more complicated than that. there is no single practice which encompasses \"gay sex\". there are two issues:

1. your partner's population risk profile 
2. the risks associated with activities performed with that partner

for (1), yes, having a partner who is in the gbmsm category does put that person at a much higher risk.  however, we could probably have an acceptable level of risk *if* we specifically asked those with gbmsm partners what activities they have engaged in over the previous 3 months (provided that their memories are clear). that's because many activities are of a considerably higher risk of transmission:

estimated per-act probability of acquiring hiv from an infected source, by exposure act (**risk per 10,000 exposures**)

* **parenteral**
	* blood transfusion: 9,250
	* needle-sharing during injection drug use: 63
	* percutaneous (needle-stick): 23
* **sexual**
	* receptive anal intercourse: 138
	* insertive anal intercourse: 11
	* receptive penile-vaginal intercourse: 8
	* insertive penile-vaginal intercourse: 4
	* receptive oral intercourse: low
	* insertive oral intercourse: low
* **other**
	* biting: negligible
	* spitting: negligible
	* throwing body fluids (including semen or saliva): negligible
	* sharing sex toys: negligible

source: [hiv risk behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html), cdc.

as you can see, if you have a gbmsm who wishes to donate, if he *only* engaged sexually via manual, oral, or toy-based activities with a gbmsm partner, then he would *likely* (more research &amp; several years of waiting would be required) have a much lower risk profile.

***however*** this brings up a number of issues, of which we have at least two which are at odds:

(1) now you are asking some *highly intimate* questions. asking questions such as these, especially if you start asking them of already lower-risk groups could be highly alienating:

&gt; research is examining whether changing to an individual behaviour-based approach to donor screening (vs. the current population-based approach) would be acceptable, and how it would impact current donors’ intentions to donate and donor deferral rates.

&gt; [...]

&gt; when considering asking risk behaviour-based questions for all donors, the impact on the number of currently eligible donors must be considered. too great a loss of current donors may affect the sufficiency of the canadian blood supply. 

(2) lots of gbmsm people don't want any questions about their sexuality asked. they want everyone to be asked the same questions:

&gt; there was much discussion about use of a “capture” question, which is a screening question to identify msm donors and direct them to additional questions that assess risk behaviours. it is not clear if this would be acceptable to gbmsm, even if it was viewed as a stepping stone towards more inclusive criteria and may result in eligibility of a cohort of gbmsm with behaviors associated with a lower risk of infectious disease exposure.

&gt; [...]

&gt; the majority of gbmsm surveyed view the current populationbased risk approach as discriminatory and therefore not acceptable.

source: [msm research program: knowledge synthesis interim report](https://www.blood.ca/en/blood/am-i-eligible/men-who-have-sex-men/knowledge-synthesis-interim-report), ([pdf](https://www.blood.ca/sites/default/files/knowledge_synthesis_interim_report_2020025.pdf))

in all, i do think that we can get better selectivity and risk reduction, however it requires *a lot* of research, particularly if we wish to maintain (1) the current donor levels and (2) the current safety level. it is clear from other countries which have fully eliminated the deferral on msm donation that they are **less safe**, as noted by [canadian blood services: \"it should be noted, however, that the rate of donors with hiv-positive test results in those countries is more than 10 times higher than in canada.\"](https://www.blood.ca/en/blood/am-i-eligible/men-who-have-sex-men)",liberals

i think that we may agree more than you think. but it's also more complicated than that... and good science takes a long time. with science, we want to have the answers fully formed before announcing the policy (see: the phac's response to covid).  

i'd suggest reading [my comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/nktwjl/it_has_been_nearly_a_year_since_trudeau_said_the/gzk3vb6/?context=10).

so let's go point-by-point:

&gt; what if a gay man isnt having penetrative sex?

* i would **guess** that, provided that he has limited his activities in the last 3 months to toys, hands, and oral, then he is probably low risk and could, **in the future once we've completed all the necessary studies** be allowed to donate. however, based on current evidence, that is not a change that cbs is prepared to make.

&gt; what if a hetro couple enjoys anal sex?

* for the woman, it would depend on her male partner's risk factors (pwid, gbmsm). 
* for the man, it would depend on his female partner's risk factors, specifically if she is known to be a pwid.

***

&gt; so again, behavior matters, not group affiliation. 

again, it's the partner's behaviour. if you are male, and he is male, then he is in the gbmsm *behaviour-population* category. so he gets reverted to the population average.  

&gt; how is this restricted to msm,

again, it's the partner's population-based risk profile.

it's pretty clear you breezed right over that issue with an incredibly superficial understanding of the debate.

the original versions of the liberal tax changes created some *incredibly* perverse effects for ccpcs. a friend's father is a tax lawyer who has literally never voted anything but liberal, and he was so appalled by the technical details of the proposals that he said he might not ever be able to vote liberal again. this is not some right wing guy we're talking about, he was pissed off about the shitty implementation and perverse effects.

and the perverse effects are, unsurprisingly, complicated because they related to interactions with other parts of our complex tax code. the point is that this debate wasn't just about rich people not wanting to pay tax. and that kind of precedent is *exactly* what people are worried about here. \"paying your fair share\" is not a real policy, and when the real policy is implemented it has to actually work properly.",liberals

hey, that's really disrespectful. i engaged with you in polite discourse and took your arguments seriously, and said specifically i didn't feel like expanding the discussion to go into the eu. and you post this. smarten up a little. 

&gt;and that is why there are moderates like me looking to vote for cpc. we aren't willing to throw every under issue under the bus though.

not the point. the point was that its clear that both parties do little - in the absence of a solid plan for climate change then your priority should be economic strength. that has nothing to do with giving up on every other issue. 

&gt;you're going back to, \"we're fucked and can't be bothered to do anything.\" i'd like the cpc to aim a little higher than that.

and i'd like you to be a little smarter than that. but we can't have everything. 

the fact is if we don't start something effective right now then by the time anything we could do that would be effective is in place it's really a little too late to worry about. and i don't see that happening. hell - you still think carbon taxes can fix the world - and we're at this point in the game. and if it were just you that's fine - but it isn't. 

meanwhile you're contributing nothing to the cpc but you demand somehow they guess your wishes and then you'll consider your options. well...  that is not rational thinking. it's just lazy - and we're out of time for lazy. and again - it's not just you and that's a problem. 

so it's really about being honest and realistic - more like \"there is no reasonable chance that people are suddenly going to do a 180, take the politics out of this, and get serious given that they have not done so in the last 30 years and show no signs of changing. therefore it's time for plan b\".  which is not the same as not doing anything, but rather is a realization we're not going to make it in time before significant global changes and the actions that are necessary must be in accordance with that. 

meanwhile, feel free to vote for justin - after he trashes the country's economy and puts us so blindingly in debt that interest rates shoot back up (as his father did) then i'll be nicely in a position to pick up a bunch of cheap property and make great interest on my cash investments.  so i'll be fine. it would have been nice if the rest of the world didn't have to suffer but honestly - if people are still trying to argue that there's a possible way that taxes of any sort can solve this problem in and of themselves - this is a lost cause within the time frames we have to work with and it's time to accept that and deal with the consequences.",liberals

did i? i was responding to the dismissal of trudeau as someone who only had nice hair and no substance despite the lpc having and actual detailed platform in 2015 that you continue to dispute. do you not recall trudeaumetre.ca that was devoted to cataloging all the promises that were made and then not kept?

i am obliged again to comment: people who think canada is an active genocidal state, when do we send our leaders to the hague? the most recent person convicted of genocide, radovan karadžić, got a 40 year prison sentence for his role in the srebrenica massacre. do you think trudeau merits the same? 

i think genocide is the absolute worst crime humans can do, and if canada were actually committing genocide, that would legitimize all forms of resistance - assassinations of politicians and judges, sabotage of infrastructure, mass defection, foreign invasion.

i think this article correctly points out that trudeau's response is not genuine - this discovery was not a surprise to people who understood the nature of the residential school system. if the government's course should change over this, it was because what it did before was plainly insufficient. yet the author levels the charge of *genocide* - but instead of demanding his immediate arrest (or graver action), or armed resistance, or anything approaching what i think people would feel is *necessary* to stop an ongoing genocide - apparently the solution is more funding for indigenous education and reconciliation.

what's obvious is this: **nobody seriously believes what's happening is a genocide**. otherwise there would not be such a massive gulf between the rhetoric and the appropriate response. what i think is underlying this desire to overstate things is the (justified) feeling that not enough is being done about indigenous issues in canada; by claiming it is the most dramatic and urgent crime possible, equivalent to another shoah or rwanda or armenia, it is meant to provoke a response. but i think that is a dishonest and ultimately counterproductive tactic. how many people calling this a genocide will go on to vote for the same government again?",liberals

i disagree. this statement would have been true up until recently, but now we have a crazier, further-right party for the cpc crazies (and crazy voters) to migrate to.

the cpc used to be able to count on retaining their far-right and fundamentalist base just by existing. there was no other option for them to leave the cpc for. so they could get away with providing lip service to the socially regressive elements of their voterbase while pursuing a slightly more centrist agenda.

now that we have the ppc, the cpc faces a tough decision. do they move more socially progressive in an attempt to capture the centrist voters who have shifted to the liberals over the cpc's stance on social issues (and lose the support of about 20% of their voters), or do they double down on things like conversion therapy, covid restrictions, anti-abortion, etc to avoid losing their further right voters at the expense of the centrist swing voters?

they are pretty much damned if they do and damned if they don't. 

we are seeing a shift in politics in canada. my feeling (can't be bothered to dig up the data) is that there is a shift to the left being driven by increased urbanization and the pandemic really shining a bright light on the inequalities in the country.  it is also leading to a surge in interest in unionization and the anti-work movement in general.  

the cpc message of trickle down benefits, denial of climate science, etc, just doesn't resonate with the majority of voters any more, but they can't change their message without alienating about 20% of their supporters. this has been brewing for a long time. the schism with the reform party was the early days, and the reunification pulled the whole conservative platform further right.

without embracing a more socially progressive platform, they can't win a majority, but they can't win a majority without the furthest right voters. the best i think they can really hope for is splitting the party with the ppc, embracing progressive soclal values and then hope for a minority win... but that isn't their way.",liberals

i would have preferred a cerb that went to all people regardless of how many hours they worked last year. the liberals originally didnt even want to give it to students, and the version implemented still left many people high and dry. if businesses were going to be subsidized in order to keep paying their workers, i'd like a system which actualy forced them to, you know, *keep paying their workers* rather than just pocket the money amid mass layoffs.

&gt;i don't know what nationalizing other then the government buying something that used to be owned by private enterprise that is literally what the word means. 

how are you this dense? nationalizing means taking over an entire sector of industry or bringing a major corporation under public control. it's not buying something for the private sector to use so they can profit more. the tmx is not an industry and further, the government announced it doesn't even intend to be the long-term owner. this was literally just a favour to oil companies after their initial deal fell through.

i mean, good for you, but it's pretty naive.

when the choice is between my wife and i retiring early and independently wealthy and my kids never having to have a student loan and to be able to do what they want with their lives; your kids paying $2-$4 million doesn't really factor in to the equation.

expecting the 60-70% of canadians that own homes to sacrifice the kind of equity we've seen built in the last decade and a half is just an unrealistic proposition.  it's a non-starter, and politically and economically unviable.

high domestic interest rates will generally make the dollar appreciate relative to other currencies with lower central rates. 

interest rates are only a portion of the problem in housing. zoning is a far larger factor, the worst affected areas have policies that strongly favour r1 single family homes, usually with lower limits on lot and house sizes. higher interest rates will make it far harder for individuals to buy relative to corporations, who for the most part, can afford sit on empty units to ride out a downturn in prices.

hc6r27v,2021-09-09T00:50:06.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - thursday, september 9, 2021 here's a random prediction i pulled outta my ass in terms of popular vote:

- cpc (35%)

- lpc (33%)

- ndp (20%)

- blq (5%)

- ppc (4%)

- gpc (2%)

- oth (1%)

my prediction assumes the ppc are being overpolled in ivr and a chunk of their numbers will move to the cpc come election day (especially in ontario). the greens will suffer from poor leadership and a lack of candidates and everything else stays the same. most of the other vote goes to the mavericks.

here are some more arbitrary numbers i've pulled out in terms of seats:

- lpc (157)

- cpc (139)

- ndp (32)

- blq (8)

- gpc (1)

- ppc (1)

since a lot of ppc voters migrate to the cpc in ontario, a lack of vote splitting ensures a surprising amount of cpc gains in 905. however, the liberals are able to gain in quebec and hold on to most of their seats overall. the ndp make inroads in bc and parts of ontario, the bloc collapses due to conservative vote splitting among cultural voters, the greens hold onto may's seat, and the ppc win beauce.

again, completely random guess, maybe the ppc are underrepresented in polling as trump voters were in 2016 or i'm assuming too much with quebec, who knows?",liberals

i just rewatched the whole exchange. blanchet talking about the classic take that is let the na decide what is good for itself and stop imposing things for it, and this is clearly evident with the repetition of letting democracy speak for itself. it's a pretty clear thing to understand if you're québécois. it's the same take the bq has for the last decades. 

trudeau answers that he can make decisions for québec because he's a québécois and that blanchet doesn't speak for all québécois and he's tired of him implying that he isn't québécois himself. 

to be honest, i think trudeau makes point because he's often seen here as an oustider that doesn't really care about the province until elections come by. his reaction might convince some that he cares.

but i think people who think it made blanchet look weak don't consider that the two takes don't explicitly connect to eachother, and so it will look whatever it looked to partisans. 

but to a neutral voter like me, i can see both points, but i think they both looked a bit bad too, as blanchet didn't make his take connect with the people, and trudeau looked a tiny bit bad by rambling about what is essentially another topic. 

and since from i gather you're very much a trudeau person, let me reiterate to be clear: i think trudeau just inched by blanchet, but only because i think showing emotions was a good political moves. i just think it clearly didn't make blanchet looked bad either. 

if you really want a moment where they both looked bad in this segment in the eyes of many québécois i know, i'll say the watching party that watched the debate at the same time as i was unanimous that trudeau looked weak in denouncing suzy kies, and that blanchet looked weak when he again spoke about indigenous people only to talk about québec's grievances. again, this might be off topic, but i hope people from outside the province might gain insight about what -- some -- pretty neutral québécois thought about this. 

p.s. and i just rewatched the interviews after the debate, and... it really seems again to be like what i gathered from the exchange. while he says, in the repetition in english that trudeau was probably as much québécois as he his, it really is because the second journalist ask him again if trudeau was or not, while blanchet steers again the answer to focus on his own subject: he's speaking about governance of québec while he says trudeau sure can say he's québécois, there's still the na that represents the will of québécois for themselves. in the other question about it, he reiterates that the only parliament that only represents québec's vision is in québec, while the one in canada represents a whole lot of people that aren't québécois. it's just, such a typical take. i'm not saying i agree, but i think people from outside the province might just no be used to those classic québécois rhetorics, even though people from the province that listen to political debates are all used to it by now. trudeau talking about identity was a good political move, but i don't think it won him anything over blanchet, as they both said things that are popular here, while not really talking about the same thing. they just made their points, and it resonated surely with the people whose minds were probably already made.",liberals

and more control over immigration, however quebec has a hard time finding french-speaking ones outside of haiti and algeria, so that may be a mirage.  trudeau hasn't gotten in the way of quebec policy there either.

edit ps.  considering my recent ban for not including the necessary framing of rwanda as a genocidal nation due to colonial structure, i need to now add a caveat to all my previous posts that also don't recognize this structure.  yes lego looking for more cash from the feds and asking for this from all the federal parties is also due to colonial structure, so that also needs to be recognized.  thanks.

&gt; referring to a country which was a product of colonial construction as genocidal, when it was created as a mash-up of several adversarial ethnic groups that were simply pasted together because of colonial structures, undermines the understanding of genocide. were conditions for ethnic violence a result of colonial oppression? almost certainly yes. so we see the labelling of rwanda as a genocidal country, without the necessary framing of the colonial structure that provided this environment for this to flourish, as genocidal is a rule 3 violation. there is a lot of nuance when dealing with these subjects and we expect our users to explain this distinction when making over-arching statements that entire country's are genocidal.

the differences between tutsi and hutu were well-established prior to any colonial appearance in africa. this is admitted by local rwandan historians, and is well documented online.

pretty damning that despite being in a minority with the more centrist bc ndp, the green party gained only minor concessions on the climate, most of which the bc ndp supported anyways. meanwhile fossil fuel subsidies increased during this government. weaver endorsing a liberal plan which specifically doesn't even attempt to meet the targets canada needs to isn't surprising.

hc6xy2k,2021-09-09T01:39:12.000-07:00,"jagmeet singh seen as most competent and trustworthy leader by cbc vote compass users i mean despite their affiliations they assessment is accurate. there is very little details in the platform on how they will actually accomplish any of this. 

“for example, in discussing carbon pricing, the ndp states they \"will continue with carbon pricing while making it fairer and rolling back loopholes this liberal government has given to big polluters.\" i have questions — let's unpack them.

first, what does \"continue\" mean? will the ndp keep the liberals' carbon pricing path, to $170 per tonne in 2030? be more stringent? less stringent? why not explicitly state what they think is the appropriate carbon price?

second, why is the current system unfair? and to whom? are they referring to revenue collection, or expenditure, or both? my research suggests carbon pricing is actually progressive, as is the liberal approach with lump-sum rebates.

third, what loopholes? if this is a reference to the federal output-based pricing system (obps), call a spade a spade. the obps is a deliberate policy choice to reduce the costs of carbon pricing for industries designated as emissions-intensive and trade-exposed. it's fine to disagree on the policy action, but if so, what would the ndp implement in its place?

relatedly, will this force federal policy on provinces? most provinces have their own provincial system; does the ndp intend to eliminate the flexibility in the current system which allows provinces to implement climate plans on their own, subject to a minimum standard?

if the ndp considers the obps a loophole, do they also think quebec's choice to give free emissions permits to large emitters participating in its cap-and-trade system is a loophole?”

running a far left candidate won’t get the ndp power federally either. the ndp with that centrist platform were actually in first place at the start of the 2015 campaign. trudeau is considerably better at the game so he ate mulcair’s lunch on the campaign trial though. the only way any party has ever formed government in this country is with a centrist approach.",liberals

if notley or some past leader had future vision powers, they may have tried to rebrand while the ab ndp was still a fringe party. maybe bring along some disaffected members of other parties to give credence to the idea that they are a brand new progressive alternative. but now that they're the only opposition party, probably not a good move",liberals

canada has something like 1000 total staff in all its embassies and consulates in china, both canadian and locally-engaged, across all the various roles.

so even if all canadian diplomatic staff in china do nothing but visa application processing and each visa application requires only a single touch, you're talking about each staff person processing 10 applications per day.  and because china's population is so massive it's really not hard to imagine swings in demand for canadian visas changing drastically over relatively small things.

the canadian government really doesn't have the resources to handle the volume of visa applications from countries like china and india in-house.  the only alternatives are either out-sourcing parts of the process, or massively throttling the amount of travel, students, business trips, and immigration from those countries.

the reason i didnt answer is because a) you haven't demonstrated in any meaningful way in which people life's or 'right wingers' would be hurt, so you're asking me to comment on a hypothetical, it seems disingenuous and irrelevant to the discussion. b) its kind of hypocritical to ask \"well what if right wingers are effected by this\" seemingly ignoring the massive history of right wingers actually effecting others by association, not hypothetically. but the short answer is, no i dont wish harm on anyone. 

&gt; if this is true, then none of the rest of this is really critical. it's impossible for us to agree because i see a problem with harming them and you see people who have a \"propensity to lead to violence\", and who have \"caused actual harm to a number of communities\". if you don't see a problem with harming them but immediately jump to why they deserve it, then i'm sorry, we won't agree.

you misunderstand, you see a problem with a hypothetical harm being done (one that you cant demonstrate outside of your imagination) but have valued that over actual harm that has been and continues to be done. i'm not sure how you're squaring that circle chief. i'm not arguing that 'they deserve it' (thats a pretty blatant misrepresentation of what im saying man). but i'll reiterate more succinctly, i'm saying its somewhat telling (see hypocritical) that someone like yourself, who i'm guessing is right wing, is more concerned about hypothetical harm being done to themselves and fellow right wingers, than actual demonstrable harm that is done by right wingers. again it seem pretty clear that your concern only extends so far as it effects you and yours, nor have you addressed any of the other points i made above. 

there is lots of room to have nuance in discussion, i'll happily call out and discuss the shittyness of right wing politics without labeling everyone as a terrorist. the inherent failings of right wing ideology are apparent even without the presence of those ideologies inspiring terroristic acts. 

again it just seems you're more concerned with the branding of right wing and being connected to terrorism, there should be room here for you to be a bit introspective on why 'right wing terrorism' has grown. i understand where csis is coming from, there is more nuance to be had when discussing terroristic motivations and its rarely as simple as 'right or left', that however doesn't exclude the broader ideological trends involved, even if there are differences on the individual level. people dont exist in a vacuum, there are always broader trends and forces at work.",liberals

i'm glad to hear that :) me too!

&gt;you misunderstand, you see a problem with a hypothetical harm being done (one that you cant demonstrate outside of your imagination) but have valued that over actual harm that has been and continues to be done.

not at all. because i don't really see it as being a tradeoff. i don't *have to* decide between this terrorist attack and the \"branding\" issue (as you call it). we can (and should) condemn terrorist attacks like this that kill innocent people without reason. full stop. we don't need to use the \"branding\" in there though when we do so.

it's the same harm as those who say muslims need to condemn muslim terrorist attacks, moreso than any other random people. it contributes to divisiveness and hate. they see muslims as terrorist-adjacent rather than as normal people.

&gt;there should be room here for you to be a bit introspective on why 'right wing terrorism' has grown.

well, we'd have to define right-wing terrorism for us to agree on that, which has been sortof my sticking point all along. so, that sentence is begging the question a bit since i'm not sure i agree in the first place. has the phrase \"right wing terrorism\" grown? sure, but that can be explained by increased divisiveness (which is exactly what i'm trying to fight) and increased definitional scope (which is related to increased divisiveness).",liberals

h1215wv,2021-06-08T04:06:38.000-07:00,"trudeau’s liberals promised to end the blood ban. now they say it’s ‘complicated’. this article is highly editorialized, like almost everything that comes out of ling and vice news. the headline - that health canada agrees the ban is ineffective based on their data - is not remotely supported by the evidence, it is an editorial conclusion stated by ling. let me just pick out the core issue:

&gt;the documents reveal that the agencies have resisted such a questionnaire because it would reveal that their current donor base actually has a high risk profile.

&gt;“gender neutral, behaviour-based screening criteria would result in excessive loss of currently donating safe donors, if all donors were subjected to the same set of questions and criteria,” the documents note. “for example, approximately 10% of first time and 5% of repeat donors have had more than one sexual partner in the last year.”

**wrong**. straight people having more than one sexual partner in the previous year presents a low risk of hiv transmission, for reasons i have explained repeatedly. these criteria are maintained because risk is not just based on behaviour, but on *who* the behaviour is with. msm with recent non-monogamous sexual contacts are at a massively higher risk of contracting hiv than straight people with recent non-monogamous sexual contacts.

health canada is saying exactly what i'm saying: they don't switch to a lifestyle-based questionnaire because lifestyle choices have very different risks depending on what group you are in. if i'm straight, i could bareback every girl in sight for years and probably never have sex with an hiv positive woman. if i'm gay and do the same, i'll have had sex with someone hiv positive within weeks.

&gt;but we aren't only asking people if they have promiscuous frequent sex with other men. we're asking them if they ever have sex with other men. that is capturing both the hiv-risky population, and monogamous married couples. it doesn't make any sense. nobody is made safer by barring monogamous gay men.

&gt;unless you're going to tell me \"they could just lie about whether they are monogamous\", in which case my response is \"they can just lie about being gay\", and we're back to this supposedly \"for everyone's safety\" measure making absolutely no sense, having zero pragmatic value.

the difference between lying about being gay and inaccurately reporting monogamy is that to lie about being gay you have to actively lie. by contrast, many people honestly report their belief that they are monogamous, when in fact they are not. the exact issue here is that one of those is actually a lie *by* the donor, while the other is caused by a lie *to* the donor. they are categorically different issues.

either would be devastating to our economy. a large rise in interest rates would lead to huge increases in the cost to service our debt, and would crush all those who’ve stretched to purchase homes and condos etc., crashing the housing market and placing potentially millions of mortgages essentially underwater all while the government’s ability to do anything about it is severely constrained. on the other side, forced austerity and a pullback of our social safety net would be a crushing blow to all those who’ve lost their jobs and businesses during the pandemic.

i was a little dubious about all that until my wife and i took our annual meeting with our financial advisor the other day (we’re not “rich” per se, but we have saved enough over the years to need a guy doing that sort of thing at a low level for us). without referencing any of the above stuff he was suddenly recommending some pretty significant changes to our portfolio - the kind that would help insulate us from a high interest rate scenario.

i absolutely agree, and it's not only that. there was pandemic election precedent for incumbent getting majorities. where the lpc really messed up was at the begging and with the release of their platform imo. 

at the beginning he compared this election to the 1945, comparing coming out of covid to coming out of ww2. the problem is that, as some pundits pointed out at the time, we aren't out of covid and would be more akin to having an election in 1944.

the other thing is that he set the expectations quite high, and his platform doest really have any major *wow* policies. it has some good stuff, child care and climate being the biggest, but nothing like electoral reform or marijuana legalization. this really puts a damper in his messaging about how important this election is. now with him saying if he doesn't get a majority we will be back in an election in 18 months, that basically kills his entire argument of it being an important election.

&amp;#x200b;

palestinians dispute not only the old city, but beyond that, because they were literally living in jerusalem until the 1960s as a majority under jordanian occupation, were thrown out by the israeli military.  in other cases, you had jewish settlers, militia or what the british had literally called terrorist groups who literally just showed up to palestinian areas including jerusalem and started mass evicting illegal and invading the lands of palestinians.

&amp;#x200b;

these people were literally, legal land owners with title deeds acquired under the british mandate of palestine, the ottoman colony of palestine or during the jordanian occupation.  the israeli government basically ignored their legal land and property ownership, took their land, houses, farms and properties in jerusalem, with zero compensation and then kicked them out of israel to top it all off and pushed them into palestinian \"territories\" which are really now just today entirely inside of israeli's borders but the israeli gov't pretends they are a separate country, except they vote at the un to block it from being recognized as a country so it can have zero sovereignty.

&amp;#x200b;

grant it, some of israel's actions are justified by palestinian terrorism and the need to provide security to israel's citizens.  which as i said it is a complex situation.

&amp;#x200b;

to then setup our embassy and land that is basically in the middle of a property dispute and territorial dispute and site of future conflict, just seems like sticking our nose into a problem we really shouldn't be.  why endanger embassy staff unnecessarily?  it would be like sticking the embassy for india or china in kashmir or some other disputed zone. even if you could do it, it is not the best idea.",conservatives

with all that said, i think her partisanship slipped out far too much during her election night coverage. maybe she was slipping up from being tired or something, but there were a number of times when she overshared, for example by outwardly expressing relief that the liberals looked on track to win, which seemed inappropriate, in my opinion.

there was a particular moment early in the cbc election night coverage that really stuck with me as a poor choice. shortly after the first results of the night started pouring in, mainly from newfoundland, barton went to great lengths to point out how much lower the gpc vote was than expected. ostensibly in newfoundland. i'm sure i don't need to explain why that's absurd on its face, but what really stood out was that she then made a comment to the effect that the gpc was supposed to actually stand a chance in fredericton, but it seemed those votes hadn't materialized, which didn't bode well for the gpc. cbc was reporting zero polls in fredericton at this point, so her statement wasn't just misleading, it was plainly false.

now, this might sound like overanalyzing or sour grapes, but i think this is quite substantive, since polls were still open across much of the country for hours after this. up until this point in the broadcast, the gpc hadn't really been mentioned at all. if there were any voters in bc waiting to see how the parties stood elsewhere before choosing whether or how to vote strategically, this misinformation could have led them astray. i'm not saying it cost manly his seat or anything like that, but i'd be surprised if it didn't have some impact. now, i don't think it was from bias or slant so much as it was an attempt to generate a salacious narrative out of thin air, and i'm reluctant to even attribute it to barton personally, even if she was the one saying it, as this could have been editorial direction she received. still, it really left a bad taste in my mouth.",liberals

further, i don't know if the ndp can survive government anywhere the liberals still exist. the sorts of compromises, failures and challenges that come with government seriously alienate and disenchant their base and, unless the ndp really is the only serious non-tory game in town, the left will turn on them pretty quick.

ns, ontario and other three party provinces that have had ndp governments have had those ndp governments collapse and reduced to rump status. where the ndp can contest for power, it quickly seems to become a *de facto* liberal party by another name, or at least make the kind of compromises or delays the federal ndp routinely blasts the liberals for.

in terms of the detail of the plans, they were mostly on a similar level to the other parties. that's not good enough. if you're going to go to the electorate and say you have detailed plans for things, you need to have the *most* detailed plans. they should consult with faculty and other experts to produce highly specific plans, which likely wouldn't be implementable exactly as is because of changing circumstances, but give the confidence to the electorate that the ndp knows what it's doing. because the ndp is the boldest of the parties, it also needs to have a level of detail that assuages fears about said boldness.",liberals

\"taking kids to court\" is an emotionally-engaging slogan that hides interesting legal issues, but it's not exactly wrong.

&gt; the liberals are taking the commission to court because they don't think it's fair that the max award is only 40k. some victims deserve more than that and should have the opportunity to ask for more.

&gt; if the judgement stands they have the option between 40k or nothing, with no opportunity to sue again.

if that were the only problem, then it wouldn't be a problem &amp;ndash; a larger amount could be granted in a settlement, or if absolutely necessary the judgment could be suspended and replaced with a more generous system by an act of parliament.  the government literally writes the law here, and it needs no court or tribunal's permission to spend money.

however, this is not the only problem.  the main thrust of the appeal is that the human rights tribunal issued a decision that included not just on-reserve kids, but off-reserve kids as well. the latter were not part of the original hearing, so there's a very good argument that the tribunal went far beyond its mandate.

however, this isn't a sexy, headline-winning issue, and on an intuitive level it does seem wrong to delay justice because of a 'pesky legal issue' like that.  our societal values of intuitive justice and rule of law conflict, so there should be no surprise that people come to different conclusions.",liberals

it is *exceedingly* obvious that user was referring to the violent individuals, it's only you that's trying to paint with a brush that includes conservatives as a whole. conservatives are free to use other social media platforms if they wish, they only run into trouble when they're either breaking the law or encouraging others to break the law. this is not a free speech issue at that point, free speech does not and never has covered criminal behaviour. 

parler refused to moderate even when a coup was planned on the platform, therefore the companies that allow it to exist decided to step in and moderate their own spaces to remove it. similar to damn near every other website or platform that refused to moderate illegal content from itself, others are distancing themselves from parler the only way they can. 

&gt;there is a reason why there is an opposition party in government. they are meant to provide the opposition voice. sure, removing them from the debate would result in less division in government. we would just end up essentially with a dictatorship then by the ruling party. nope, having opposition voices in a discussion is beneficial to the discussion.

so you didn't actually read anything where i said that these companies can choose who they partner with or provide services to. nobody has to think it's moral though.

&gt; google, apple and facebook have a mind-numbing amount of big data. they're not stupid. they crunched the numbers and realized it's more profitable for them to throw parler under the bus than to piss off a greater amount of their paying customers. as a private company, they can do that under the charter and the first amendment.

goa4vn0,2021-02-21T07:36:06.000-08:00,"usa now vaccinating more people against covid-19 in one day than canada has in total i work in an industry that's been particularly hard-hit by restrictions and concerns about being in close proximity to others. a lot of workers in the industry have been pushing for a return to status quo so that people who've been laid off will be recalled, and those who haven't can get their incomes back up where they were. they spent six months making posts about how covid is no worse than a cold, so we should just open up and get back to normal, and they won't change their opinions no matter how much data is thrown at them.

when the first vaccine data was published, they jumped on any negative point they could find to show that keeping things closed for another year until everyone got vaccinated would be futile. they emphasized inefficacy in a small percentage of patients over the clear benefits to the vast majority, and they screamed and shouted that \"we don't know how long immunity lasts, so the first vaccines will have worn off by the time everyone gets theirs!!!!\" they tried to use that as justification for giving up and reopening.

now those same people are berating the government for not getting everyone vaccinated within two months. there's a lot of overlap between them and conservatism, so to a large extent they'll take whatever position they think casts trudeau in the worst light, but there's massive cognitive dissonance involved. in november, they were saying that the vaccines won't be effective, and now they're complaining about the lack of vaccines.",liberals
