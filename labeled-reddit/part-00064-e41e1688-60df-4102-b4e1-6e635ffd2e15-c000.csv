the az vaccine is not bad. i understand there are some concerns with extremely rare blood clots but describing it as bad is dangerous misinformation. health canada has reviewed it and has deemed it [safe](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/health-canada-astra-zeneca-rare-side-effects-1.5986988).

&gt;pointing to evidence from the u.k., where the astrazeneca shot has been administered 20 million times, sharma said the chance of developing these clots is roughly 1 in 250,000.

&gt;meanwhile, sharma said, the odds of developing a \"regular\" clot — and not this rare, vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia (vipit) in people with low platelets — are 1 in 5 for people hospitalized with covid-19.

&gt;the risk of a woman between the ages of 15 and 45 developing any sort of blood clot is 1 in 3,300. if they take birth control, the odds are 1 in 1,600. if a woman is pregnant, the risk is 1 in 300, sharma said.

they actually believe it is safe for all adults. naci is restricting it for now, but dr. sharma said they may update their guidelines after reviewing more data. 

they also will not be restricting the use of [j&amp;j](https://twitter.com/perreaux/status/1382358856165163021) with the current data they have - which i believe is that 6 out of 7 million people in the us got clots, with no deaths that i'm aware of.",liberals

1. public health restrictions - primarily provincial responsibility. the atlantic provinces and the north are doing great, provinces elsewhere are struggling.

2. income supports, so that people can stay home and avoid spreading the virus - primarily federal responsibility. ottawa's motto was \"whatever it takes.\"

3. vaccine procurement - primarily federal responsibility. ottawa signed a lot of contracts last summer, and now that manufacturing of the new vaccines has ramped up, we're only [a month behind the us](https://twitter.com/trevortombe/status/1382117997754654720?s=20) in getting canadians vaccinated with their first dose.

all three are still needed. vaccines were developed faster than observers expected, so there's light at the end of the tunnel. but that doesn't mean that we can let up on public health restrictions - this is true even in the us. in bc deaths are way down, because the elderly and health-care workers have gotten their first dose of vaccine, but cases are still rising (like the uk's third wave, when tight restrictions seemed to have no effect on the variants).

though i honestly wish the alberta liberals or abp could win an election or at very least get more representation in parliament. i'd pick notley over kenny easily, but a big negative that both share is their unwillingness to address the province's budgetary issues. both keep highlighting unrealistic royalty revenue projects to finance government spending above 2015 levels (as a percentage of gdp) for the next decade or so.  this however is fairly unrealistic and the province will either need to come up with a plan that  raises revenue, reduces spending, or some middle ground between the two.

there's always the thought that more equitable seat distribution would also change campaigning, strategic voting, etc.  also, your comment about gerrymandering is an important point.  if you work purely from a eligible voters to a riding formula to determine a riding, how do you make sure the division is as impartial as possible?  do you do away with regionalism altogether, and have seats assigned by vote tally?  79882 votes to a seat, based on eligible voters divided by seat count, and if there aren't enough votes to fill a seat, we leave it empty?

i've never been hard-core about electoral reform, either, other than a mental exercise.  i do  feel that each seat should have an equal population base, both provincially and federally. if only because i'm well aware that my voice counts for less as urban dweller than it would if i lived somewhere rural.

the carbon tax throws a wet blanket over any trade exposed export industry (especially ag).  in the mid 2000s my parents received carbon credits for the carbon sequestered in their soil due to zero till practices.  under trudeau we get a bill.

i think it would be good to build housing similar to brownstones/rowhomes/etc in those cities vs more singles or even big townhomes. provide a small patio space to people as part of it, and nice community green space to share (a park can be smaller than a bunch of big backyards), and you can still give people decent sized homes for families. 

honestly, as 1400-ish sqft 3 bedroom house, decent size. even if it was a larger condo flat style, that works too. 

we jut don't build the right kind of denser living that people want. the shoebox condos are very much young professional, super small unit focused. and they've been a boon to airbnbs too. but they're not for families and guess what, there's a whole new generation of people finally starting families. millenials are behind the curve on a lot of things compared to the previous generations due to the hand we've been dealt, and this is just another one of those issues. 

frankly, i've resigned myself to accepting i'm a lucky millenial but i know many others who are kind of stuck. i'm as close to middle class as i can be now and i'm lucky to have gotten my house 2 years ago to even be in there. if i was buying today, i wouldn't feel this way. and i don't even have a comfortable way of buying a new car, i can stretch for one, but i don't want to. i could get a used gas car for cheap when this one konks out, but i want to be good for the environment and get at least a plug in hybrid. 

in other cities we can do a lot to build small singles, or decent towns with decent backyards. not every city is the gva/gta in terms of dense housing. ottawa has a lot of new builds, and even the surrounding area, there are huge singles being built in richmond - 15 minutes from the highway that is 20 minutes from downtown without traffic. we're talking the equivalent of ottawa still having farmfields, and empty space at scarborough distances. 

so its not about density everywhere even - its just about having the builds going up. and you can have more dense builds planning far ahead, but at the same time, we're already focusing on more dense townhome and rowhomes within a 20km bubble of downtown ottawa, and the issue is builds going up slowly. so like - again - outside of the gva and gta there is more than enough chance for affordable living.",liberals

worked on a ranch for three years in rural alberta, you're talking to the wrong caricature. i'm still not a huge fan of guns, and i've shot them plenty. i see the need in rural areas, not in the city. it's a reasonable restriction. and \"don't focus on the gun, focus on the people\" is an abdication of responsibility. guns kill far more efficiently than a knife or most other things. not to mention these same people are almost always against social support.

my support for strong gun control laws is not out of ignorance. 

no matter how many times i am told that i don't understand, that existing laws are already good enough, that the laws aren't evidence based, etc., these arguments fall on deaf ears. to me it is a simple matter of controlling proliferation. the fewer guns that are legally sold in this country, and the fewer there are in circulation, the less likely they are to end up in the wrong hands or cause an accident. 

i support the use of long guns for hunting and sport shooting, and think it is ok for people to continue to be able to use handguns under very restrictive regulations for sport shooting, and past that, i really think the benefits of reducing proliferation outweigh the benefits of gun owners having access to more firepower.

i don't agree with the government's approach all the time, because i agree with the claims of critics that some of this is security theatre, but if you ask me to make a choice between more handguns in cities or fewer, i am going to support fewer every single time, even if the effect is only incremental.

all the gish-gallop walls of text that gun advocates have at their disposal are not going to affect that stance, and to be honest, i have tended to disengage from debate on this topic because the tactics of the advocates are so annoying.

in large part, this had to do with fns not really falling under canadian responsibilities at all. indian affairs only gave the schools a budget of a few thousand dollars (for all of them), basically seen as an easy 'extra' on top of treaty requirements. the church offered to do it free, that was probably the whole conversation from the feds pov in the 1800s. from the fed's perspective at the time, the poverty in native groups was concerning, and getting some modern education would help. at the time, many fns agreed with that line of thought, a number of them out west and in the plains actually demanded european education for their children as a treaty point ... although i can't imagine they knew what they were signing up for would result in.

during this time period the feds were morally responsible for the neglect that allowed this shit to go on, but they did not carry it out or ask for it.

the school system was assumed as a full federal responsibility in the late 60s, where they would be fully responsible for all that was carried out, but it was short lived. the government quickly handed control and responsibility to the fn bands in the 80s (including funding responsibility which led to many closures) ..... and then started helping with funding in the 90s.

the safe water thing is a misinformed concern more than anything though. it isn't the fed's job to provide water to people (they don't for non-natives and no one complains about it), and they've spent many billions of dollars to do so for reserves anyways, and the problem has been mostly solved in the past few years.",liberals

one example: quebec's invocation of s. 33 for their laicity law, which allows the province to bar cultural and religious minorities from employment.

how you missed *hak v. pgq* if this is actually an area of interest to you is beyond me. 

on my broader point, s. 33 has become very much in vogue over the past two years.

quebec is introducing another s. 33 use for its language laws. it is promoting casual use of s. 33 as a way to normalise ignoring charter rights. 

ford vowed to use it any time the courts overruled them on the basis of the charter when toronto challenged his disruption of their election, and then did use it when his government's lawyers flubbed his third-party campaign limits case. 

higgs in nb had proposed using s. 33 preemptively to avoid pesky lawsuits. he had to back down because of his minority situation. that's no longer a problem - we'll see how things play out going forward. 

jason kenney, an old fan of s.33 (he proposed using it in response of gay marriage and to end the application of *vriend v. alberta*) is now passing broad anti-protest legislation. no promises yet to use s.33, but it appears he's leaning that way. 

conservatives in general seem pretty on board with this whole using s.33 to ignore charter rights when inconvenient thing. 

sadly, something being a charter right ain't the protection it used to be.

jason kenney’s anti-protest law is most certainly unconstitutional in any application where it’s not just redundant (trespassing laws are still a thing). everyone knows it was for virtue signalling and if they didn’t use it on the numerous large protests during a literal global pandemic it’s never going to get used by crown prosecutors.

it benefits anyone who rents a place for longer than 1 year, which is most.

it also prevents landlords from using extreme rent increases as a way to evict people without cause.

eliminating all rent control could basically give landlords the power to evict people at will, without cause, which would create an unbelievably skewed power dynamic.

\"i'm raising your rent from $1200 to $2400. don't like it?  i guess you better move out (and i'll find a tenant i like more, probably at a lower rent than $2400).\"

would you submit a maintenance request, knowing that if it annoyed your landlord, they could double your rent next year?

&gt;every other landlord can just set their rent to whatever the market value is **when they get new tenants every year, so it’s just non effective for like 90% of renters**.

aside from undergrad students, who moves every year?

i highly doubt that 90% of renters move every year, or anywhere close to that.

33% of the population are renters, and undergrads are like 2% of the population (and not all of them rent - many live with parents).

i'm 30 (and a renter), and most of my friends that are renters have lived in their place for at least a few years.  i don't know anyone that moves annually.

it's not inherently wrong to be vain, but when your expression of vanity has little outside utility and also is a public safety risk, well, we're crossing from benign vanity to dangerous vanity.

sport shooting skills have no specific utility in the society we've created for ourselves here, and the weapons used for the sort of sport shooting captured by a semi-automatic weapons ban shares the semi-automatic weapons that are used to commit mass shootings.

for me, that's a simple calculation. when it offers no utility and is inherently dangerous to people uninvolved in the sport, it's not a sport we should be keeping around.

especially given the incredibly small demographic of competition shooters in canada. we're not talking millions of people, we're talking thousands. and i'm confident those thousands can find a safer way to express their vanity.

just like everyone who isn't a competition shooter is already doing.

applying subjective judgment to other people actually *is very canadian*. look no further than how canada's national identity is built in no small part on what we are supposedly not - the united states of america.

it just doesn't make that much sense to me because the severity seems out of whack with the measures being proposed.  in the fully vaccinated a case of covid-19 is comparable to influenza in its severity.   so how does that square?  

a thought experiment.  how would we react if covid-19 appeared today but only affected us like it affects the vaccinated?  we'd never have heard about it.  no changes would have been made.  but now?  we're willing to upend the social order indefinitely and impose extensive government tracking for this.  so, should we not have done that a few years ago for influenza, a comparably serious illness?  should we have been carding people at restaurants to ensure their influenza vaccine status?  it would, like this, perhaps prevent a handful of deaths per year.  why this but not that?  (should we follow up with extending it to influenza too?  yes, that's both a slippery slope argument there, and a genuine public health question.  i'm undecided either way.)  

it just seems out of proportion.  we're going to spend a good amount of money on it (trudeau has promised $1 billion to the provinces for implementation) and the actual number of lives saved is...?  how many, actually?  and how many dollars per avoidable death over the next few years?  that's a valid question to ask and few seem to be discussing such things.  

yet the public seems to want it regardless.  i'm fairly sure part of it is seeing it as the only option for getting back to business.  if you told people they had to get a unicorn tattooed on their foreheads they'd even agree to that, at this point.  i also suspect at least part of the motivation is to punish the bad people by denying them nice things.  this is your fault so you can't go to the gym now.  rather than anything based on a cost effectiveness or public health rationale.  you can see that in any comment thread on the topic.  glee and spite abound from all sides, rather than more productive emotions.",liberals

as the other user mentioned, this isn't at all true. the judiciary is bound to the precedence of previous judicial decisions, but the executive isn't bound to previous decisions by previous executives. how would that even work? if that were the case, no government could do anything different than the one before, which would render democracy pointless. 

anyway, as the other commenter said, judicial precedent is written down, through years of court decisions. they're just not codified in one specific place, but they're all written down. there are unwritten constitutional conventions in canada, but those are very specific things from british parliamentary history. they don't just get made cause pierre trudeau invoked the war measure act cause bourassa asked him too.",liberals

&gt;they want to make folks like youtube identify the people behind everything they upload--which is insane. but that's specifically provided for in the proposed amendments.

source, please.

&gt;when a lot of the stuff they're talking specifically about wanting to do would end up walling canadians off from a lot of the net, that's a big problem. they're talking about setting up mandatory blocking of foreign sites--ie, a great firewall of canada.

alright. i clearly can’t argue with “the stuff they’re talking about”. bill c-10 has become a conspiracy theory subject to people who traffic in all the logical errors and psychological motivations of flat earth theory. i never expected to convince you, but there were at least things to respond to before. i’m not going to chase “the stuff they’re talking about” around while begging for sources or specifics anymore.

i look forward to the passage of c-10, which currently has the support of all parties but the conservatives—and even they were generally on board until they smelled a wedge issue to fundraise on—and is likely to pass eventually, if not in this parliamentary session then likely the next, unless the conservatives win the next election, which seems a long shot. this legislation or something like it will come, sooner or later, because it makes sense, and i look forward to watching all the hysteria dissipate, just like it did after c-16 passed and jordan peterson wasn’t thrown in jail for misgendering, as was claimed, and neither was anybody else.

i’m glad we criminalized rape before the current intellectual climate took over. i don’t think i could have handled the online “debates” otherwise.",conservatives

some people are desperate enough to have multiple roommates per 1 room. i do not think we will see a market where people are able to say \"oh wow renting is expensive, might as well buy\". because homeowners are charging mortgage, tax, water, and any other upkeep on their rentals, because they can, renters can't afford to save for their own home. they are already fully+ paying for someone else.

i think the idea of renting out needs to change, legally. 20 years ago it was \"rent to supplement a part your mortgage payments\", now it is \"rent to pay your mortgage+, huge profit, in 15 years, sell for 300% profit\". imagine only have to put down the down payment, then have renters pay for your entire investment. pure profit at the expense of those who can't afford to buy.

until politicians are willing to go after these predatory practices that are rampant and ruining the housing market as a whole, we won't see a change going forward. government can't build homes fast enough to keep up with demand. raising taxes will never change this, it will only force rentals to go up in price.",liberals

after the first test the grades were averaged and everyone got a b. 

the students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy. but, as the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too; so they studied little …

the second test average was a d! no one was happy. when the 3rd test rolled around the average was an f. the scores never increased as bickering, blame, name calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for anyone else. all failed to their great surprise.

gv7a5uz,2021-04-19T23:58:13.000-07:00,"with one budget, freeland overturned 3 decades of political orthodoxy | cbc news &gt; while in power, u.s. president ronald reagan and u.k. prime minister margaret thatcher personified an anti-government agenda that prioritized cutting taxes, repealing regulation, shrinking the state and deferring to the market. [...] but it can also be read as a document that nudges the federal government and the political debate further away from the thinking of reagan and thatcher (and, in the canadian context, stephen harper).

i think \"nudges\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in this section. and is a much more accurate depiction of what's happening than the \"overturned\" language in the headline. 

the budget's message and marketing is certainly in line with the idea that it's time for more government involvement. but almost all of its near term commitments are programs that are direct responses to covid, and are meant to end. it's akin to how governments responded to the 2009 financial crisis -- big programs, yes, but they were meant to end in relatively short order and return us to the reagan/thatcher economic status quo. it makes sense that this budget would include programs like that, but to actually overturn the status quo we need programs that are meant to last to not just be promised, but to be in place and helping people so they can't be rolled back. and this budget puts that stuff off a *long way*.

the obvious example of this being put off is what we were told would be the centerpiece of this budget -- affordable child care. even according to this budget, that program won't exist for another 5 year. i saw someone on twitter point out that their kid, who isn't even born yet, is already too old to be helped by this program. they'll be in school before they're old enough to benefit. perhaps more to the point, 5 years is at least one election (probably 2) away from now. it's pretty likely that the liberals won't be in power long enough to make this happen, and you can pretty much guarantee a conservative government will cancel it -- unless it's already in place.

that's if we take this promise at face value. a quick look at pharmacare in this budget shows a massive step backwards (on a file which could also have been used to step away from the status quo model of government involvement). gone is any mention of creating a national formulary, or a canada drug agency, or even a transition office. the hoskins' report isn't mentioned, and zero of its recommendations are still being promised. essentially, this budget promises pharmacare won't happen under this government. that's only *two years* after the liberals gave pharmacare a place in their 2019 budget similar to the place they've given to affordable childcare in this budget.

if the liberals put forward a detailed plan to provide affordable childcare in 12-18 months, *that* would be a sign they were willing to overturn 3 decades of political orthodoxy. but, when promises are 5 years out, \"nudge\" is the appropriate word. and nudges don't really get you anywhere.",liberals

&gt;not a si gle province came to singhs defense on that. we're a federation, and healthcare is provincial jurisdiction, anything proposed without their consent isn't worth the paper it's written on. 

and the federal government has the power to incentivize provinces to expand the public health care system. stop saying muh provincial jurisdiction to justify inaction towards policies that will benefit people. childcare is provincial jurisdiction, and trudeau is incentivizing provinces to bring it in rn. it's the same situation, except liberals don't wanna bring in pharmacare. they've been proposing it for the past 25 years, and have failed to make any action towards it. better yet, liberals are only bringing in childcare now, when they had a majority from 2015-2019 to bring it, showing that they are only doing it so they don't lose the confidence of the house.   


&gt;the canada health act took almost 20 years to implement, maybe singh can start some of the hard work now.  


ndp brought in the first incarnation to sk, pearson govt ran a commission on it which recommended the sk model and all parties in the govt agreed to create the medicare act which created our current system. cha just finalized it in the 80s, and set national guidelines for health care coverage. ndp plan for  pharmacare was to allow provinces to voluntarily agree to pharmacare conditions modelled after cha, which was also recommended by the hoskins' report, and allow provinces to figure it out themselves via extra funding.",liberals

for example, if the government decided to ban the use of feather pens, it would very likely stand up to charter scrutiny. however it would be incredibly unreasonable and the court could strike it down on those grounds.

it’s also not promising by the way, when a comment makes false assertions that are incorrect and then links an article designed for mass consumption as they’re source. 

and no actually it’s not the same in practice. letting a significantly blunted virus circulate is not the same as bacterial gene transfer. the reasons bacteria are able to confer resistance to antibiotics is because of their ability to execute transfer while still alive rather than through descent. if you grow some bacteria and destroy them with an antibiotic, that bacteria will never develop any kind of resistance. however, if before it is destroyed a minority of bacteria that have that resistance transfer that resistance to another strain, that adjacent strain will then be the one that confers resistance. this is because there is a fundamental difference between *treating* an infection and being *immunized* against a particular pathogen

i spent 6 years studying this and have working in a related field for the last 5. youre damn fucking sure i’m gonna boast my credentials especially against someone claiming incorrect info and then posting an ars technica article as evidence of their knowledge

it’s true not all viruses will lose fitness with mutation. however, other coronavirus have routinely shown this to be the case for that subtype of pathogen. on top of that, viruses which do not eventually lose fitness with successive, numerous mutations are often those which mutate much slower.
