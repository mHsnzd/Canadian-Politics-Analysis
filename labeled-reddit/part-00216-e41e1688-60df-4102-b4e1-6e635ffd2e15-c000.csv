having said that just because it's someone else's responsibility doesn't mean we can't be effective at helping with the issue. we do, after all, frequently put fences in front of cliffs to prevent accidents. 

so what are the proposed solutions?  one, as you propose, is to basically legalize the drugs and regulate them.  well - regulation ain't gonna do squat if criminalization didn't, and the illegal variants are already cheaper than we can buy properly manufactured drugs for. 

which means what you're really talking about is subsidizing the drugs so they're cheap enough that those who choose to use drugs will go that route.  which does nothing to get them off drugs, there will still be overdoses but fewer, their lives will still be a horror show frequently involving homelessness and significant suffering, and we'll still see the same crime problems as people require money to fuel the habit. 

so... what have you really solved? 

the other choice is very well funded rehab and post-rehab support programs. they also will not work for all users but at least the ones they do work for will be able to lead normal lives. in the long run that is the cheaper and probably more humane model overall.

that's literally how all of pharmaceuticals work. the ones that know the product best and have unfettered access to it and already have a bunch of clinical data on it continue the research on it. hc reviews their data when they recommend such things.

&gt;we don't know how safe it is to take mrna vaccines every 6 to 8 months for years. 

this just belies a lack of understanding of how vaccines work. mrna vaccines have existed since what, the 80s? the only new thing is that we're now using them on humans instead of animals. but we've known since polio vaccine that any side effects from vaccines present within 2 months of getting the jab. this is true for all vaccines. it's not like you get a vaccine and then 6 months or a year down the road something bad happens, that's not physically possible. there's nothing dangerous about mrna vaccines, quite the opposite actually, which is why they even recommend that one for pregnant women, and they can barely even take tylenol at this point. an annual booster isn't any different; it's not like there's leftover vaccine accumulating in your bloodstream or anything that would interfere or cause issues with getting another dose. vaccines just don't work that way. the worst you'd see is reactions like what you're getting with the initial doses.",liberals

six days later, on nov. 10, another document was filed in the saskatchewan court of appeal by a senior department of justice lawyer.   
the \"notice of abandonment\" informed the court that the federal government's position had changed. the appeal was withdrawn and the case was closed immediately. no reasons were given.

well that's interesting. while the previous cpc government attempted to fight this and force the church to pay. one of the first things the incoming lpc government did was abandon it. i guess they only fight court cases against indigenous people, not in support of them.
