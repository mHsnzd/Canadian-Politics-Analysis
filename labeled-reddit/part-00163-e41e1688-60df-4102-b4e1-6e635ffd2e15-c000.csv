it certainly isn't helping matters at all that literally *almost* everything being claimed by the 'experts' is being proven wrong or put into doubt time after time and again. just for example of the most recent moment it happened, is during this whole between wave 3 and 4, the 'experts' were claiming that you couldn't transmit the virus if you somehow caught it. some were trying to claim that breakthrough infections shouldn't happen nearly at all. 

the reality?

wrong across the board. turns out that not only can you catch it, experience symptoms, possibly still be hospitalized from it, and even spread it; but to top that all off, since that virus managed to breakthrough the vaccination wall, it's probably stronger somehow too; so you might even die from it.

i.e. if that goes far enough, you basically get a new variant. 

so, the more people who are realizing this kind of thing, the more people are not really liking having to hear trudeau or literally anyone else go on and on about the platitudes of vaccinating right now. a lot of people did it to not have to wear a mask for instance. 

whoops. they were wrong on that one too. look at the usa. look at chile prior to all of this.

*this is because the \"modern conservatism\" you speak of is just forms of liberalism. you have the classical liberals, and you have the neo-liberals.*

that's exactly what i responded to. at no point did you ask for a definition at all.

maybe - and virtually all political models would argue that their vision of it is best. but that's not what you said - you said it was a hallmark of the conservative ideology that you consider families. it isn't. it's universal. so you were wrong - it doesnt' distinguish conservationism from any other model does it. it's like saying \"conservatives are pro-breathing.\"

&gt;also how the heck is traditional conservatism not more adaptive than liberalism for example?

so you've given up on the idea that conservatism is the most adaptive? apparently, seeing as once again you refuse to explain why. 

however - to answer your question briefly (because i actually do know what i'm talking and can defend my position), classic conservatism is literally the desire to conserve how things are now at its' heart. preserve the existing social structure. preserve the existing moral code. preserve the existing traditions and to take an active part in that. 

it's literally a resistance to change. so by it's very nature it does less well adapting to new conditions and new situations. as a model it's designed specifically to not adapt to change. 

classic liberalism fairs slightly better, as it tends to focus on personal freedoms a little more and that's more adaptive than the stricter adherence to traditional roles and values that the c's would pass laws to protect. however - its still hampered by it's tendency to paint itself into a corner.",conservatives

so it's basically impossible to control for bots; thanks to advancements in machine learning, it's fairly easy to create a bot that behaves like 99% of users. keep in mind that most users don't comment much, if at all, and so it's a matter of creating input and location patterns that look real. not that hard.

cheaper still is to simply hire hundreds of people in developing nations, plunk each one in front of a few dozen phones, and give them a rough script to work off of.

and then there's stolen accounts. even with 2fa being pushed on folks, there are still millions of old-but-not-dead accounts floating around that have compromised credentials; and those look real, because they are real.

it's not like the 90s and early naughts, where bots were simply 20 line scripts that hammered api endpoints for engagement metrics; it's not uncommon to have an army of vms running real clients driven by computer-controlled inputs. or engagement farms in developing nations, where a single person controls dozens of devices.",conservatives

the thing about albertan voters is that we're entitled. we want balanced budgets, low taxes and no service cuts. with both notley and kenny's governments we've rewarded parties  that have told use what we want to hear on budgetary issues, but not what we need to hear. notley herself would have been fine if she just tied her governments spending increases to revenue increases (alberta's expenditures  would have risen 1.4% of gdp in 2018/19 compared to where they were in 2014/15,but we would have had a balanced budget) or raised as pst to finance a 2-3% gdp spending increase (though any alberta government would likely be punished for that).

so as a whole, we the albertan electorate are to blame for our problems for the past 15 years, but we don't like being told that. notley and kenny's government's each are running a deficit that's around 2-3% of our gdp, yet we don't want a pst and we don't want to reduce spending back to prentice era levels, while every party that proposes an actual solution like the alberta liberals gets punished for that via losing their seats.",liberals

my general impression of trudeau's cabinet is that the collective experience has been so much more varied than what we've usually seen in canadian politics. even the cabinet ministers that turned put poorly usually had a very unique perspective, that it was worth the effort to see what they brought to the table (monsef jumps out in particular here). 

i also think trudeau hasn't helped the argument about gender balance by being pretty flippant about his rationale. i think the argument for gender balance for this particular government session. the economic recovery needs a strong gender balanced view given how the impact was disproportionately on women. it goes for the same reason why you want regional representation around the table, so, every part of canada gets the right consideration.",liberals

trudeau has failed in different ways. not testing people coming in from other countries or quaranting travellers early on. and our quarantine rules are disgusting, the amount that someone has to pay for quarantine is ridiculous and and, it isn't properly enforced. this is what brought variants into the country and this is what sparked the 3rd deadly wave we are all facing now. 

add to that premiers fudging up containment measures and... ontario should be closing down known sources of spread but instead blaming the people for gathering while not addressing all the workplaces experiencing massive outbreaks. 

the blame doesn't lay solely on the prime minister and this is not the scandal this article makes it out to be, nor does it make trudeau an international shame. 
the uk and brazil both let covid infect their countries to such an extend that there are deadly, more contagious variants circulating the entire world, killing thousands more. we haven't heard of a variant of concern out of the us or mexico, but they have done no better in terms of containment. now the us and the uk have high vaccination rates, we forget how the pandemic was treated in each of these countries? our pandemic response was way better at the beginning, just because we are behind on vaccinations (like the majority of the fucking world) doesn't mean trudeau has to step down. 

at this point i would rather see doug ford step down. he has shown enormous incompetence in containing the spread of variants. will not shut down non essential warehouses or factories that could help reduce the spread, has not implemented paid sick days so people can afford to take time off to get tested... the list goes on and it is long. instead his stance has been to blame us for gathering. yes, i know people have been breaking the rules, but those people are not 100% responsible. workplaces that have outbreaks and the politics surrounding what to do about it is massively responsible. because nothing has been done.",liberals

i think there are two pretty significant groups that flock to the lpc.

first, there's the group that think the lpc is the best route towards a further left, progressive canada. kind of the \"like the ndp but choose the more popular team to get elected\" types.

then there's the wealthy business type who like to like the progressive stuff, to a point. these are the \"business liberals\" as you put it. this includes the paul martins, mark carneys and bill morneaus of this country. eventually we get to a point where these two groups meet face to face, and it gets really weird, contradictory, and virtue signally.

this past lpc convention is a good example of this.

at the lpc convection, the membership passed a motion supporting ubi. what a great, progressive policy. that was promptly followed up by the membership defeating a motion to support reducing the capital gains exclusion amount to be less than 50%, which would raise taxes on investment profits.

somehow, the lpc is a party that says they support a ubi for the poor, but is against raising taxes on the profits of the wealthy investor class to actually pay for what they say they want.",liberals

singh’s advantages: relatively young, good looking (for a politician at least), good with social media, media savvy, stylish, etc... the problem is that trudeau has all of these advantages as well, but trudeau also has the perception of competence and legitimacy that comes with the liberal brand. faced with that choice, most people would go with trudeau. 



in a way, singh feels like a copy of trudeau in terms of style and delivery. people are gonna go with the real deal, rather than the copy cat. if singh ran against o’toole and some boring old liberal like paul martin, then his style advantages could shine. trudeau basically nullifies all of singh’s advantages as far as style and perception are concerned.",liberals

hdgmcxy,2021-09-18T23:38:36.000-07:00,"the final politics, polls, and punditry thread - sunday, september 19, 2021 there's a lot they should have done in retrospect. 

my armchair analysis from a watcher perspective of their campaign is this:

they had a plan ( ;) ) to get their platform out early a d really sell canada on their policy list as the path forward (secure the future makes sense in this context)

they had 2 good weeks of just laying out their policy list. they had 2 weeks of being able to capitalize on \"why have an election?\" that the media was beating on along with singh too. 

they took a fast early lead in the polls. a commanding one at that. 

they had 2 weeks of pure sunny rosy media coverage. everyone was just giving them the chance to put their position out there. no one knew otoole in the general public and he he had 2 free weeks with a flat footed liberal campaign taking the brunt of negative media coverage and erin's job boiling down to smile, question trudeau on his recent decision, and look unthreatening.

then, the media started asking questions. otoole started to get questioned. his policies started to be scrutinized. the free 2 week ride was over. and at the same time the liberals caught their breath as they had a chance to not be under the microscope 24/7 in public. they found the gun issue wedge and it came out during the tva debate.

this sudden shift of no pressure to high pressure really hit the cpc campaign hard. they buckled. they really buckled. they responded to the gun issue horrendously. and while it only carried for a few days, it was enough to begin to paint erin not as a positive moderate who has conviction caring, but as an individual who just wants to win and he'll say whatever you want to hear. 

see when you have no \"personality\" in the public sphere you have the chance to really mold that image. they didn't mold it, to the extent they did they were trying to say \"i'm a moderate, i'm reasonable, i am willing to listen, and that is why i made *this* plan\". 

but then he changed the plan. \"i'm willing to listen and be reasonable\" cuts both ways. it can make someone look pensive and risk averse or people pleasing as much as it can make someone seem logical, open to admitting mistakes and changing because of them. 

had he stuck to the platform that he had created through the initial \"i am listening and so i made this plan\" bit, it would have shown conviction. it would have shown he's willing to actually take stock of information and what people want before making decisions. but changing his position in different languages over different days and amending a platform he was originally committed to that's bad. factor in the stories from running as true blue in leadership for the cpc and it just gets worse.

they never recovered from the original shift in the sands. they never had a strong enough leadership to dig in and own their policies. they painted themselves into too many corners (see 'we trust the provinces' and kenney a few days later admitting he made mistakes - without otoole acknowledging that fact). he's been the reasonable change position listener for electorally expedient things to the centre and the right, and he's gone both ways on the same issues. 

so when people don't know you and see that, it's easy to be painted a weathervane by the flank on your right taking the hardline right wing, and painted an untrustworthy person who can't keep his story straight by the flank on the left known for measured \"we hear you and we are here for you\" politics in the last couple years.

the air of uncertainty in the pandemic might not be happy with trudeau right now but at least he has the conviction to stick to his word.",liberals
