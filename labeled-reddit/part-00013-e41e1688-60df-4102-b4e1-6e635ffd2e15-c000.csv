i think this is more an argument in favor of recognizing the cultural importance of minority cultures/religions rather than an argument against the cultural status of catholic monuments in quebec. white french catholic settlers were by far the majority population in the province, it's obvious that the vast majority of historical and religious monuments here are going to reflect that, but it doesn't mean we can't also celebrate the cultural contributions of other ethnic and religious groups in quebec. here in montreal, we have the oldest synagogue in the country at 250 years, it should absolutely be celebrated as part of quebec's patrimony. it doesn't need to go hundreds of years back either, we can and should celebrate quebec's older mosques, its older hindu temples, its older orthodox churches. we should celebrate the cultural impact of our significant jewish and black diasporas.

catholicism is absolutely the biggest winner in the \"cultural, not religious\" argument, it's both undeniable and inevitable, but it shouldn't preclude us from including the contribution of religious minorities in quebec's patrimony. catholicism and protestantism's cultural hegemony is in part the result of racist policies, but i don't think it invalidates the cultural importance of those religious artifacts - even when seen through a secular lens.",liberals

they absolutely did not. budgets balance themselves you know. :) what they had was a few policies that people liked and that's it. dope and electoral reform. 

and it's easy to see the truth of the matter. the liberals and the ndp were completely deadlocked in the polls for most of the election. if it was the policy that was persuasive that wouldn't have happened. it was largely a personality contest between mulcair and trudeau and a perception of who could beat harper, mulcair tripped up with the quebec issue and justin milked it and everyone flocked behind him. 

the policies played a fairly small role and the plan was extremely light. but he had great hair. 

&gt; they need a leader with some combination of competence and/or charisma, a positive appealing platform, and a good campaign strategy to sell it (also helpful if the liberals have worn out their welcome after a decade or so).

sure - it's never an either or.  but it is actually easy to win - it's the execution where most fall down. basically it boils down to a strong platform and vision and a strong campaign to deliver it. but - you need either a charismatic leader or a charismatic plan. harper was not charasmatic at all. justin was but i'm sorry - if you think that the 2015 platform was 'strong' you are off your rocker. you can get by with one or the other - better to have both of course but either one will do if you do it very well.",liberals

grvurcz,2021-03-22T12:19:20.000-07:00,"did the cpc ruin their chance to win the next federal election with the recent convention controversy? im not sure but these are my ideas.

* nuclear solution
- give provinces an incentive to build nuclear plants
- \"all but one of these reactors are located in ontario, where they produced 61% of that province's electricity in 2019\"
- but that could be problematic. first of all what provinces even want that? ontario already has enough. 
- there are regressive environmental groups like sierra club that are staunchly against nuclear energy. but arguably voters that listen to what those groups have to say, will never in their life vote conservative. 

carbon tax alternatives
* tax airline polluters 
* luxury vehicles tax (over $75,000) 
* regional carbon tax
- if liberals have no problem with carbon tax, let them bear the brunt of it. this could be a way of getting ontario without alienating alberta. the idea here is to make rich and more carbon consuming regions pay more than poor ones.

i don't disagree with your portrayal of what happened, but are you suggesting that, had they simply *had* a budget ready in march 2020, then we wouldn't have had this problem? i find that hard to believe. the existing budget probably wouldn't have helped address the problem (since it was developed before covid) and i'd doubt it would make sense to spend the beginning of the pandemic developing a budget for what was at that time (and really, still is) a rapidly changing situation.

(as an aside, the \"solution\" to the ppe problem, as i see it, probably should have been addressed 5 budgets ago, or with some other policy around procurement of emergency supplies that will hopefully come in the future, oops)

&gt; however, if they had sat down and planned out a proper budget at the beginning of the year, they could have identified that the pandemic would cause issues in shipping and procurement, and started investing in domestic manufacturing. in the long run it would have cost us less money, and we wouldn't have had our supplies lines cut off by the us/chinese governments at inopportune times.

so, i guess (like above) i just don't see how a budget fixes any of that, especially given the time the pandemic started. how do you plan for something like that and (more importantly, since this is what the article is going on about) why specifically is a *budget* the right tool in the middle of a pandemic? especially considering the changing circumstances. i feel as though any high-level spending doc would have been rendered pointless after not too long and would just be a waste of time.

&gt; by \"eyes closed\" she means that they've been mainly reacting to problems as they happen. rather than anticipating and preparing for them. (i.e. \"eyes wide open\")

i don't know if that is really her main point though. she gives 5 reasons for the two-year budget as being irresponsible, and sure, planning is one of them, but this is just like the ppe question above: what were they going to plan for that could have actually been predicted? did it make sense to spend time working on a budget (not exactly an overnight process) when we didn't even know if it was going to be relevant in two months?

i guess overall my problem is that she is trying to make black and white points about a situation that is inherently grey. when i see \"our eyes are closed\" i think... \"hold up, i've been essentially following spending, and while it's definitely going crazy and i haven't been following every single dollar, i'm getting the general thrust of things.\" then again, i work for the feds and i have some (small) interest in seeing where the money goes (though more as it pertains to my specific institution).

on the other hand, i'm a big ole nerd and maybe other people don't look at things like i do.

anyway, i don't think our eyes are open or closed, they're somewhere in the middle (which makes no sense, because the eye analogy is falling apart).",liberals

nevermind labouring in it... in the past few years we've had a neat new phenomenon, the wetbulb temp going above the human survival temperature.

so, the way your body cools itself basically is sweat evaporation. on a hot day you drink lots of water, or pour water on yourself or point a fan at yourself. the wet bulb temp is basically the temperature you would reach with infinite water, shade, and breeze. generally this is well below the danger point. if you're hot, so long as you drink fluids and find some shade, you'll be ok....... this is no longer always true. in some places, the wet bulb temp is so high that your body cannot cool itself below dangerous levels.

the result is that if you go outside or anywhere that isn't actively air conditioned, you will get a full body fever and will die. water won't help, fans won't help. you'll just die. typically when you overheat, your body protects your organs and brain by transferring heat away from them to protect them longer.... with a high grade fever, you may feel like you're burning up, but your brain is still at a nominal temperature because your body prioritizes it. this is no longer possible. your brain will overheat, you get brain damage, heat stroke out and die. you need to be in an airconditioned building, or maybe underground where there is a large thermal sink that hasn't had time to match the outside temps.

taking a bus with a fan instead of ac and the route is 30mins to your destination? you, the bus driver, every passenger better get out and get inside before then or you'll all die before you arrive. skinny, fit, overweight, none of that matters. you'll have a stroke, your brain will cook, and you'll die.

do they? i thought immigration had remained fairly steady, with slight increases, despite all the media surrounding it. we rely on immigration for our long term sustainability, especially with people here have less and less children due to economic conditions.

do you have any data about the impact of immigration?

from my perspective, i agree with your general sentiment but feel it is misplaced. employers, phobia of raising taxes, and speculation all weigh in to what we are experiencing. 

how can we be such a rich country with stagnant wages for decades? it is a choice made by our employers. we provide so little power to people to push back on the ridiculous profits being made. it's not even a topic. instead we create scapegoats out of immigrants?

https://www.statista.com/statistics/443063/number-of-immigrants-in-canada/
there has been very little change since 2000, yet housing prices have skyrocketed unrelated to steady immigration.

the threshold for buying a house was lowered, we introduced a huge population of canadians that finally qualified for loans and lenders were happy to give them. this rush of new buyers, was noticed by those already wealthy, who already had homes. for them down payments were easy, and it was easy to compete because they could leverage their existing equity into another. we the experience the speculation you refer to, you are not just competing with first time home buyers but with people who are just looking to make a profit.

this would happen regardless of innovation. if housing only goes up, and we are unwilling to propose measures that brought in people right on the edge, and the already wealthy home owners then we have our bubble forming. foreign investment contributed for sure, but it's not the root cause.

sine the 1980's wages have stagnated, while income inequality grows, how would things look if we had remained on a fairly steady trend? if this wasn't possible than why do we allow a small number to disproportionally grow their incomes at the expense of everyone else? these are choices made by the wealthy, policy makers, and businesses to retain and grow their wealth at our expense. reducing immigration will not solve our problem.",liberals

gvbp4f7,2021-04-21T00:05:57.000-07:00,"national pharmacare a key element missing from freeland budget maybe?

the pm's press [release following](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/12/10/prime-minister-hosts-first-ministers-meeting-fighting-covid-19-and) the dec 10, 2020 first ministers' meeting certainly made it sound like they'd at least agreed to setting up the canada drug agency (emphasis mine);

&gt; the prime minister proposed the following areas in which to begin work, supported by new federal investments: improving long-term care and health care delivery for people across the country, increasing mental health services, coordinating on digital platforms and information sharing between jurisdictions, and making progress on a national, universal pharmacare program while lowering the cost of drugs. on pharmacare and high-cost drugs, **the government of canada, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, will create a new canadian drug agency**, and build on the recommendations of the advisory council on the implementation of national pharmacare.

a press release from a meeting between the provinces and federal gov't which says the provinces and federal gov't will do something together strongly implies there's been agreement to do that. and if the provinces agreed to create the cda, then the liberals leaving it out of the budget is pretty inexcusable and 100% on them. 

but, *technically*, that release didn't say the provinces agreed. and this is a gov't which loves carefully worded statements which are designed to convey one thing, but can technically be argued to say something else (which is the actual truth). maybe that's what happened here (if so, that's still a problem for blame shifting -- that they were playing games to make it sound like there was an agreement where there wasn't. but it's *less* of a problem.)

still, going from that statement to saying pharmacare can't go forward because the provinces won't agree in four months, when there have been no other known efforts to make it happen in the mean-time, is something that requires some explanation if we're going to blame the provinces. and it's worth noting that the liberals' position isn't to blame the provinces... their position is that pharmacare *is* going forward... somehow... someway... despite them no longer planning to take any of the steps which will get us there.",liberals

no, there's $500m for a program that's tangential to pharmacare.

the hoskins' report talks about a national strategy for expensive drugs for rare diseases (which is what the $500m is for), but is pretty clear it's something separate from pharmacare. here's the actual language it uses (emphasis mine);

&gt; the federal government should work with provincial and territorial governments to develop **a distinct national process** for providing fair, consistent, timely and evidence-based access to expensive drugs for rare diseases.

also,

&gt; the distinct process and funding for these specialized drugs should be in place **in conjunction** with the coverage for the priority list of essential medicines, beginning january 1, 2022.

the plan was for that program to come into effect at the same time as pharmacare. but it's not necessary to pharmacare, and doesn't lead to pharmacare. it's also a promise that was made before the specific promises the liberals made on pharmacare, and is continuing now that they've backed away from all those other commitments. it's a good, but separate, thing.

the liberals are trying to retcon the plan, and claim that the national strategy for expensive drugs for rare diseases is somehow a \"foundational element\" of pharmacare -- but that's bullshit. both the hoskins' report and the 2019 budget were clear that the foundational elements are a national drug agency, a comprehensive evidence-based list of prescription drugs to be accessible to all canadians (formulary), and investing in in drug data and information technology systems.

2. the pointed to statement speaks about april 2021, when the carbon price is still incredibly low.  they specifically exempt any consideration of the future carbon price going up to $170/tonne.  that's a key cornerstone in considering which plan is \"better\", but they just \"assume it away\". that makes this basically worthless.
3. they're not comparing the price on carbon to the price on carbon. they're comparing the lpc carbon price against the ***entire cpc plan***.  this has two issues. first, it ignores that the carbon price is only **one element** of the lpc government plan.  the lpc plan also has various incentives, fuel standards, and other requirements that apparently are being ignored.  two, it assumes that the cpc will actually implement command-style economy controls and massive regulatory burdens on carbon emissions. if you believe that i have a bridge in montreal that's essentially permanently under construction to sell you.

so yeah - this is a pointless fluff piece by a think tank bought and paid for to \"study\" an issue under incredibly strict constraints and assumptions to get the result that was desired.

on the one hand, the canadian right can't get into power unless they're a unified bloc. fact of the matter is that the majority of the canadian electorate is centre to centre-left. the high water mark for vote percentage for the conservative party was 39.62% in 2011, harper's majority. if you go back to the pc's, a party that would come to represent the cpc's left flank post-merger, you still only get around the mid to low 30s, though occasionally breaking into 40 and even 50%. while you may be able to point to the lpc's numbers and find similarities, this ignores both the ndp's 15-20% on top of that (and further left) and the greater overlapping accessibility between the two. in terms of possible electoral pathways the only option the cpc has is appeal to red tories and blue grits in ontario and qc (maybe in atlantic canada as well if they're feeling particularly ambitious) and hope that a combination of incumbent fatigue and vote splitting puts them over the edge. furthermore, the social conservation wing of the party is instrumental in terms of volunteers and fundraising. the actual logistical undertaking of running an election campaign would be *much* more difficult for the tories without them.

on the other hand, social conservativism is toxic to a majority of canadian voters and they are far too influential of a faction to simply be kept locked in the basement. access to abortion is the status quo, same-sex marriage is the status quo, support for trans rights is on the rise, as well as support for bans on conversion therapy. while there is some nuance to positions on the abortion debate (support for some restrictions is non-negligible), most canadians don't want these issues re-opened and lpc-cpc swing voters aren't going to trust erin o'toole to not throw women or lgbt+ canadians under the bus to appease the socons in the base and caucus. 

splitting the party would guarantee another decade in the wilderness and open up the door for a political realignment that could see the right of centre locked out of power indefinitely. (though this would require a handful of stars to align.) 

keeping the socons puts the party in a death spiral that will only increase the faction's influence as the party sheds central canadian support/seats and consolidates in the parries, rendering it little more than the bloc-west.

the merger of the pcs and reform was a marriage of convince that's been staying together for the kids. without electoral success to bind the factions together something is going to have to give.",conservatives

you also missed my whole point about the long history of the conservative party (the main driver of this policy and the lion's share of the votes for it) being explicitly racist against muslims (until now), and their long history of support for america's far more extreme response to islamic terrorism, which is classified as an ongoing mass killing given the legal status of the iraq war. which is the exact correct comparison point, because there actually is a fairly serious terrorism problem in xinjiang - that's what's driving this whole scenario. but the issue is that china is responding by going \"hey, let's just make the region not muslim, problem solved,\" an incredibly extreme response with a hugely unnecessary level of (to use canada and america's favourite idiotic term) \"collateral damage\" attached to it, which is why it still amounts to genocide. however, they're also not just going \"hey, let's just kill everyone there\" - the favoured response of the root source of this international denouncement (the american government).

so i explicitly covered that the main groups condemning the uyghur genocide do not and will not condemn any of america's genocidal actions (especially since america itself is one of them) towards the same group of people, and i've explicitly applauded anyone who does, which is a minority of the measure's supporters, given the composition of the votes that passed it (mostly conservative, with majority reached via ndp support).",conservatives

gnpxflw,2021-02-16T10:26:26.000-08:00,"trudeau government would allow municipalities to ban handguns under new bill my understanding is that municipalities in general are indeed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces, but that \"exclusive\" hasn't been interpreted by the courts to mean what you are saying it does. in particular, provincial and federal laws are both allowed to incidentally impact entities normally under the exclusive jurisdiction of (respectively) the federal government and provinces, as long as the main purpose of the legislation is within one of their competent jurisdictions.

for example, a bank is not automatically exempt from provincial insurance oversight merely because of its federal charter if it decides to operate an insurance business, and a provincial consumer protection law governing contracts for credit does cover banks and not only provincial financial institutions. i realize that's the case of a province regulating a entity under federal jurisdiction and not the reverse, but this canadian constitutional principle is symmetrical.

can you give an example of a court case where a court has explicitly addressed whether a direct delegation of power from the federal government to municipalities as part of a broader legislative scheme that is generally within federal jurisdiction is permitted, and to what degree the court has approved the provincial power to restrict (or mandate) the exercise of that delegation? if you don't indicate such a ruling, i'll respect that you think it's clear but won't immediately be convinced of that myself.

evidently the lawyers advising the trudeau government are not convinced it's clearly forbidden, or else they'd just be gratuitously signing up their client for a quick injunction against this legal provision as soon as a court is inevitably asked to rule on it. they would have instead drafted it to allow the federal government itself to ban firearms in portions of the country, requiring periodic consultations to figure out where relevant local opinion (either directly or through elected officials) wanted that policy. that would achieve basically the same substantive outcome, if with different politics.",liberals

i'd go as far to say if things go south economically, this is close to the worst outcome, the worst would have been winning like 135 seats with a stronger ndp. it's not like they just got elected for the first time, the electorate isn't going to be as tolerant of any missteps from a 6+ yr old govt.

i think we have to take into account the fact that at the time there were only 3 parties represented in the national assembly and one of them had only 1 seat. quebec had very much a two party system up until fairly recently and at the time, the share of the vote for the two main parties (which varied over time, but there were always only 2) were higher than what we're seing today.

when parties used to regularly win over 45-50% of the popular vote, they could more easily form a majority government despite losing the popular vote. now, and this is true both for quebec and the federal elections, there are more parties with seats. in quebec there are 4 and at the federal level, there are 5. parties are  now rarely winning elections with more than 36-37% of the vote. therefore, it's much more improbably that a party could have let's say 34% and still get a majority government. again, it's not impossible, but it's harder than with 46%.",liberals

the american election had something of a not insignificant influence on my decision. i was kind of pulling for bernie before he lost the primaries. i realized, though, that even if he would have been nominated, it would have been hard for him to get elected and for him to even get many of his ideas translated into legislation. i also realized that biden was still the most progressive candidate they had.

what matters to me are the issues and policies being put forward by the parties and who has the most realistic chance of enacting them. i'd consider myself progressive or at least left of centre on these items, so the natural choice would be the liberals. on climate, the liberals were proposing the most realistic and serious plan. you can complain about the pace of progress all you want but i was not willing to risk the overall direction changing under the cpc who failed to convince me they were even remotely serious about the subject. additionally, their childcare program is going to help a lot of people and i absolutely did not want to see that scrapped by a cpc government in favour of a tax credit. for me, these were the two biggest policies that won them my support. 

so, i wasn't willing to stick with the ndp this time around because i didn't want that action to be undone, but also because the campaign singh ran really turned me off of them. it was very negative and consisted of constant attacks on trudeau with very little being said of what the ndp would actually plan on doing in government. i did not buy the argument that a cpc and lpc government would be the same, again, because of those policy discrepancies. overall, i felt like their campaign was devoid of substance and it was particularly apparent with all of the things they did to try to attract younger voters. i don't think that skateboarding and playing games on twitch actually translates to votes. 

as to the so-called \"broken promises\", the liberals have actually kept the vast majority of the ones they have made and have acknowledged that there is more work to do on certain issues such as providing clean drinking water to indigenous communities. the scandals are a drop in the bucket when it comes to actual policies and legislation in my opinion and i feel like it was justified to let canadians have a say in the post-pandemic direction of the country. lastly, i think that the liberals did a good job managing the pandemic itself and deserved a reward for it.

the ndp get tol far into the weeds on some issues, and not far enough on others. my girlfriend's parents are pretty liberal, but think the whole \"tax the rich\" schtick is silly. firstly, many people think they're rich (or poor) depending on the context. secondly, that's not really a policy and the conservatives have done a good job of teaching liberal followers that too much taxation of wealthy people leads to flight and stagnation. 

the ndp needs to get out of their echo chamber of equity, rainbows and friendship, and actually suggest things that people all over the country want if they ever want to win. i know many staunchly ndp supporters and sometimes they're worse than my conservative friends. people on the ndp side need to understand that not everyone spends 24 hours a day thinking about politics, equity, inclusion, and morality. people are afraid of the far left because they represent similar fears as the far right, massive social change, being hated by others around the world, hurting a good portion of the population, financial and economic ruin on the back of ideology.",conservatives

if the opc pulls another majority off another strong 905 performance then odds are the issue wasn't one of policy with o'toole, but his ability to get his messaging across.

if the opc struggles in the 905, that could indicate bigger problems than messaging and simply swapping leaders likely won't help.

i realize that ford has his own suburban toronto/905 specific brand, but if a badly bruised ford can pull another majority, which i expect he can, then the cpc can sell it's brand in that region. ford's overly cautious approach this summer likely has saved both his party and the cpc a ton of grief in the future, after seeing what kenney's unpopularity did this election.",conservatives

 sentiments also do not magically vanish with legal changes and we can still see plenty of people in society who hold antiquated values. i know that if you belong to a majority grouping it is extremely hard to see those values but minorities definitely can see plenty of them if they fit into certain intersectional categories. if police, the ag's office, and the courts protect one another to arrest an individual who has committed no real crime (something we regularly see unfortunately, especially in the south of the us) then there is a real problem within a system that legally is supposed to protect minorities. if i watch the kentucky ag's office exclude information when educating the grand jury for the trial regarding brianna taylor's murder and the court upholding that protection of police, then it looks real bad. same with ramsey orta who filmed his best friend being strangled to death by cops, had guns planted on him and his mother by cops according to him, and was then forced to admit guilt to protect his mother from conviction. he was then attemptedly poisoned by the nypd with rat poisoning in his meatloaf and had to be protected and removed from the state to prevent police from murdering him in prison. all because he filmed them executing his best friend. 

cptcoatrack's take on mlk jr. is meant to point out that minorities are the ones who face real persecution in these situations while white, straight, cis men bitch about being publicly criticized and possibly losing their jobs over their opinions. these are two different worlds and i can say that as a minority who lives outside of the world of the majority. even cis white gay men often feel that the complaints of other minorities are false because of their exclusion from persecution and violence.",liberals

secondly things like pharmacare and improving ltc will need substantial buy-in from the provinces, [and cannot be implemented without their support](https://outline.com/v4nmp5).

the last thing is that the liberal party is slow and cautious in implementing its goals. this is in part out of federalism and regional  concerns, and in part strategic interest. just because the grassroots supports policy, doesn't mean that many voters will, particularly in the suburbs. considering that the party is winning elections, there's little interest amongst the base in rocking the boat. arguably the liberal party's biggest strength is that its grassroots are loyal and don't cause issues, and the base knows this.",liberals

while it needs to leach it's life from a host it's not really human.  do humans feed through a parasitic connection to a host?  no.  things that don't get rights do that.

your hypotheticals can be answered in the same manner imo.  
was the zygote or fetus able to live in a non-parasitic manner?  if yes then 2 humans were harmed and hopefully the law deals with it in that manner.  
was it still parasitic in nature and unable to survive without the host?  then the host has the rights not the cells.

there is no easy answer but just like o'toole says, women have the right to decide if their body is used to incubate and birth or not.  

imo if they wait until the fetus is capable of being human, then they waited too long to exercise their rights.

one thing to consider if you wish to try and define rights for 'pre-born' or whatever terminology plays well is a mother can refuse a child's need for organ donation.  if a 5 year old child needed a kidney, the mother is not required to provide that kidney.  that is much less an ordeal that pregnancy and birth.  the level of ordeal is irrelevant but why would a woman be required to forfeit body rights for a potential human of her creation but not for an actual human of her creation?",conservatives

guajgli,2021-04-12T06:01:48.000-07:00,"justin trudeau hasn‚Äôt delivered on his pledge to establish public pharmacare this has become a somewhat common talking point, so i think it's worth illustrating that it's simply not true.

you've stated that \"most premiers do not want to establish pharmacare\", but if you read that article, it actually says something a bit different. it says that most premiers do not want to *pay* for pharmacare (and healthcare in general). the liberal's own report actually discusses this very issue:

&gt;‚Äúas with medicare, it will be up to individual  provinces and territories to opt in to national pharmacare by agreeing  to the national standards and funding parameters of pharmacare,‚Äù the  council wrote, while recommending that ottawa foot the bill for  incremental costs to the provinces and territories during the coverage  expansion and implementation. they urged the feds to start immediately  with willing jurisdictions, understanding that some may take longer to  get on board.

this isn't surprising or unusual, it's long been the case that if the federal government wants something to happen in an area of provincial jurisdiction, it has to pay for it. perhaps doug ford has an ideological problem with pharmacare, but the best way to deal with that is to simply create a system and let ford pay the political cost of opting out. few premiers are so bull-headed as to give up federal dollars.

in fact, the liberals themselves have shown this to be capable of this many times before. the canada health act itself is perhaps the best example, but justin trudeau's own government has achieved progress on provincial issues in many areas. the [national housing strategy](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/housing-national-benefit-1.4413615), the [pan-canadian framework](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-premiers-climate-deal-1.3888244) for climate and [childcare funding](https://globalnews.ca/news/5907861/trudeau-child-care-spaces-promise/) are all fine examples of the federal government successfully engaging in provincial areas with success. the key to all these actually-existing policies is that the federal government committed sufficient money - usually over half the cost. unfortunately, this is also what they have been unwilling to do on pharmaceutical coverage. when the federal government says that the provinces are standing in the way, what they really mean is that they aren't willing to pay the cost to get the provinces on board.",liberals

if we wanted a provincial leadership position. i could see him running for alp or abp leadership and trying to use his brand recognition to build the party up and offer an alternative to centrist voters dissatisfied with the ucp and andp, but that's still a long shot. while i'd be very happy to see both the ucp and andp lose votes, the lines for the next election are already firmly drawn between them and i feel like they're just going to be trading places during the next couple of elections every time either one of them messes up or inherits some kind of budgetary or socio-economic problem.",liberals
