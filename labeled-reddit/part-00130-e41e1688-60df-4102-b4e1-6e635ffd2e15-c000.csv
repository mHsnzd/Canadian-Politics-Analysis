so now i just think you didn't read the thing you're disagreeing with. to recap:

&gt;the circumstance is this: in the immediate aftermath of an election, the outgoing government tests the confidence of the house and fails. the incumbent pm then asks the gg for a dissolution. **in these circumstances, the gg has the right to refuse the request.**



&gt;it's a little niche, but it almost happened in bc in 2017, and it almost happened federally in 2008. it did (more or less) happen federally in 1926.

(emphasis added)

nobody in this thread believes the gg will refuse the request if trudeau asks for a dissolution on sunday. that's not what is at issue.

that said, you're *still* wrong on the way the process and the law actually works.

&gt;if a minority is achieved after the opposition can approach the gg to form a coalition. that the gg could not approach the opposition to ask if they will form government before. 

after any election, the incumbent government has the right to test the confidence of the house. when an opposition party has a clear majority of seats, the incumbents, by convention, decline to try this. when there is no overall majority in the house, however, things get more complex. the government will try to ascertain whether they have the numbers to get a throne speech passed. if yes, they go ahead and try it. if no, they either try and fail or decline to try and the pm resigns. the gg then tries to see who is likely to command the confidence of the house *and asks them to try to form a government*. almost always, although not necessarily, this will be the leader of the largest opposition party.",liberals

he was going to return alberta to prosperity by saving the energy sector. he created a $30 million/year war room to stamp out misinformation about the energy industry (it failed miserably) and set up a $2.5 million public inquiry to flush out foreign operatives who mounted anti-alberta energy campaigns (we have yet to see the commissioner’s report, let alone a horde of foreign operatives heading for the hills).  meanwhile global oil prices plummeted and the industry tanked.  
he was going to balance alberta’s books by imposing draconian cuts on public services. albertans grumbled and finally lost it when cuts to physician compensation resulted in doctors reducing services and leaving the province. he backtracked, a bit.      
he was going to redress ottawa’s unfair treatment of the people of destiny (or is it the buffalo people) by creating the fair deal panel to force trudeau to give alberta a better deal with veiled threats of separation, only to see his agenda highjacked by the wexiteers who launched a serious separatist movement.  
he was going to increase albertans’ freedoms but spooked everyone, including his staunchest supporters, by using the covid crisis to pass bill 10 which gives his cabinet the power to suspend laws and create new ones indefinitely. this one is going to court.  
then to add insult to injury, along comes covid-19 which drove trudeau’s approval ratings up and kenney’s approval ratings down. funny how a little thing like generous social assistance from the federal government, and meh social assistance from the alberta government will swing public sentiment.

i'm not talking about city busses with rural connections, i'm still talking about national/provincial intercity bus that serves both urban and rural communities, like greyhound did. people living in urban areas used greyhound too to get between cities, it wasn't exclusively for rural communities. that's the point; it benefits more than just those living in rural communities.

one compromise might be to presume consent, and make people 'opt out' in advance if they really don't want to vote. this doesn't need to be a complicated or rigorous process, but it at least forces people to actively make that choice, instead of being simply apathetic. there's significant evidence of this type of strategy increasing participation in organ donor programs, for instance.

ultimately, none of this really gets to the root of the issue, which is that a very material portion of the population simply does not feel engaged enough in the political process to want to make their wishes known, which defeats the purpose of representative democracy. mandatory voting won't fix that, since it will encourage compliance, but not necessarily engagement.",conservatives

listing your qualifications/competency is not a private act, and it is very much a public matter in a public election. just because he got away with it or so long doesn't mean it was okay to hide it.

maybe you aren’t fully grasping that we are talking about managing a $2t economy of 38 million people with hundreds of thousands of employees in the government working on behalf of actual day to day problems to the best of their meager human ability.

i remember as a teenager listening to late night radio when the us channels cut across the lakes and hearing rush limbaugh and getting excited by his ideas. then i grew up and moved to ottawa for university and realized that almost all of government were average professionals like me working on behalf of every citizen who needs services of one kind or another. 

social media makes the politics of easy answers and quick rage and constant anxiety way way way more powerful because that’s what the algorithms are optimized to spread and they love it.

the days of nolton nash bringing the country together with one singular national news cast are long past us.

to say there should be no limit to the discretion is itself a violation of the opinion of the court where it says that the different branches of power must respect the proper functions of the others, and the parliament can only work if there is a non dissolved parliament in actual session and it would be outrageous to democracy if a prime minister could shut up things like legislative activity, especially oversight power, and passing the bills people want them to pass, just by dissolving it with no rhyme or reason than the prime minister´s vanity or selfishness or fear of losing power. 

the prime ministership is an office that was never created by the constitution nor empowered by it. how can it have such a strong power to dissolve a constitutionally established and democratically elected legislature far more representative than the prime minister is of the people?

it is perfectly within the competence of parliament to create conditions for what a no confidence vote is, what a confidence vote is, and when parliament may be dissolved or prorogued. conventions and prerogative must be exercised within the limits of statutes. at the very least it is possible to forbid the prime minister from offering advice for a dissolution even if you can´t stop the governor from doing so.",liberals

&gt;“i think that, you know, a minority government is an opportunity to work with all parties in the house, and i wouldn’t be opposed to a deal at all,” said terry beech.

i think this covers it.  the stability of having the votes to pass bills quicker would be nice but it's not necessary. the liberals know no one is calling for an election anytime in the next year or two.  the government can put forward their legislation and it might take a longer time but it will pass. just like they did in the last parliament.  

if there is a formal agreement, it would  involve ndp support in committees.  the cpc have already started pushing for a new investigation into margaret trudeau for example. keeping committees on track and not bound up in fishing expeditions would be worth an agreement.  which would make life a bit easier for the liberals but isn't crucial.

under the canada evidence act (“cea”) there is a process that is automatically started whenever the ag (independently from the government) determines release of documents will have negative impacts on national security or international relations. a specific department in the ag’s office then issued a s. 38 notice. 

a s. 38 notices not only prohibits disclosure of the documents but also prohibits disclosing that the s. 38 notice itself exists until the notice has been made public by the ag. once the ag begins the process they will usually then start an application with the federal court. so, those odds the ag and not the gic. the application will eventually set out the documents, the proposed redactions, and the rationale. the process will go before a specially cleared judge and be done ex parte - the the court usually appoint an amicus to present another point of view. 

once these arguments are heard, interested parties can then present there point of view- without yet seeing the documents. this would include the house of commons. 

this is a statutory process, mandatory, and separate from governmental interference. it’s worth noting this actually means that this case is likely justiciable as it’s about the clash between two parliamentary acts - the document production motion and the cea. the motion did not *specifically* void the cea provisions, so there is a true conflict here. 

it’s also worth noting that trudeau likely *cannot* solve this by declassifying things. section 38 protects international secrets too. if we got secret information from allied intelligence then we’d likely need *them* to declassify too.",liberals

you have some proof of this, or is this just your feelies? 

&gt;the older people tend to be more engaged in voting, especially at a municipal level. younger people often skip municipal elections.   

so, you want people to be more engaged, yet you bemoan that boomers show up to vote, slightly more regularly than anyone else.   you want them to vote less?  

&gt;the cities have grown to a point where the municipalities should not allow single detached in the core.   

you think the problem is that single detached home development is toronto's problem?  or are you talking about the suburbs, which obviously are not the downtown core?  sorry, you need to clarify that.  
 
&gt;most cities that transition from medium city to a major city take those decisions of the hands of 'neighbors'. cities like tokyo don't consult neighbors when building and it allows the city to build to demand.     

really?  you are talking about one of the most populous cities in the world, and in the last 50 years has grown from 11.5 million to 13.5 million people.  why don't you find a city that has had tremendous population growth over the last 50 years, also preferably in the west.  

&gt;tangential.    

it's absolutely not just tangential.  have you not been paying attention to the skyrocketing real estate value all over the country, as people flee the big cities for cheaper residences?  or do you think everyone who moves to new brunswick is in their 30's?   

&gt;the cities and other levels need to shift zoning out of the control of home owners. eliminate consultation and just let the market eventually buy out the single detached in the core and build up. the owners aren't going to get shafted ad they will make a handsome amount in the sale but they should not be allowed to stall all change.   

this shows me that you have a very naive understanding of how the real estate market actually works.  you think it's zoning that prevents a developer from building a 6 unit apartment building (3 story building) in a residential area, versus some 4,000 sqft 3 story house.  umm, builders want to build the single home, because they can easily sell it.  there are plenty of buyers out there for multi-million dollar homes.  otoh, there isn't the same demand out there for 6 unit apartment buildings, owner wise, unless those apartments can generate a whole lot of revenue, eg, high end apartments.  it's the cost of the land that's the problem.  that 6 unit apartment building is going to cost over a half a million per apartment to build (especially in vancouver) and of course it will have to generate the cashflow to pay for it.  meanwhile if there ever was a government that was serious about building massive amounts of low cost housing, their 25-30 investment would see their revenues shrink, massively.  so why gamble on an apartment building, when you can build the monster house, sell it and walk away with your investment in 6 months?    you need to look at it from a developers point of view, as they control the development.  

also, you want to blame boomers as if they are the ones who are desperately trying to maintain the value of their homes.  let me help you out here.  i'm not a boomer, i'm gen x.  since i have been living in my current home, it's value has increased at least 250%, probably closer to 300%.  do you think that makes me happy?  it doesn't.  why, because i'm not planning on selling my home for another 25 years, so it's current value is irrelevant.  if the market dropped 50%, i would still have my same small mortgage, and my same home.  all i would have lost is equity that i'm not going to access.   and if i did want to move to a different home, it's not so easy now as the market is crazy.  i'd end up with a smaller home and a larger mortgage most likely.  that's what older canadians face in this marketplace, you can't move, unless it's from toronto to somewhere cheaper.  what if you are one of the millions of folks who live in the somewhere cheaper place already?  where do we get to move to manitoba?  newfoundland?    that leads me into the next little issue.  you keep saying that it's boomers trying to maintain their home values.  i don't think you understand that most boomers already have 300-400-500% equity gains in their homes.  if a bubble bursts, so maybe their home is now only worth 350% more than what they paid for it all those years ago.  but think about all those younger people who have been buying over the last 5 years.  if there is a bubble, they go from a 50% gain, to a 20% loss.  they end up owing more than their home is worth.  now tell me who has more interest in maintaining the current market system?  someone who has lived in the same home for 35-50 years, or someone who is going to get murdered if the bubble bursts?  

you are simply following the internet trend of blaming the boomers, when the reality is everyone is to blame.  the young people who only want to buy a single detached house to raise their kids, versus buying a condo.  they are the ones driving the market, and i doubt any of them are boomers.  what you are doing is convenient scapegoating.",liberals

h5792wi,2021-07-14T07:24:57.000-07:00,"green party considers membership review for embattled leader wow. not a review *by* the membership - a review *of* her membership. in other words, the green party's federal council is considering whether to eject paul from the party entirely.

&gt; ... the code of conduct also says any green member can be expelled from the party by a simple majority vote of the federal council after their membership is reviewed. members are given 30 days to prepare a defence before the council decides on their membership, the code says.

to me this seems like overreach on the part of the council. this process doesn't seem to be intended to remove a party leader.

having read dale smith's *the unbroken machine*, which criticizes the long-standing practice (first brought in by the liberals more than 100 years ago) of selecting the party leader by a vote of the membership at large, rather than by a caucus vote (as continues to be the practice in australia), i would guess that the green party's federal council is intended to serve the same purpose - basically, given the small size of the party caucus, the leader is accountable to the council. but because paul was selected through a vote by the membership at large, she can reasonably claim that she's accountable to the membership, and not to the council.

smith argues that electing the party leader by a vote of the membership is a bad idea because (a) the caucus has a closer and thus more accurate view of the leader, (b) effective leadership requires being able to work with the other members of caucus (worst case is that the members elect a leader who is incapable of working with caucus), and (c) the caucus can act more quickly to replace a leader - organizing a vote of the entire membership is a major endeavor.",liberals

municipalities are legal entities of the provinces. so what you're proposing would have to be a platform of each province, and a conservative federal government would have little to offer. federally it would be next to impossible to roll out a sales tax that applies unevenly. there is no way it would pass a constitutional challenge. they would have to apply it evenly and then rebate tax payers based on income or other registered status - like agricultural worker or such.

allowing municipalities to gather consumption tax is something i know toronto would go for - they've been asking for that power for decades. if the ontario conservatives would give them that power with the caveat of collecting carbon surcharges i think they'd agree.

how does this proposal address industrial carbon output? consumers are responsible for about 40% of emissions.

the ndp plan has its strengths, particularly i think in eco-friendly home renovations and the rest of the \"improving where we live and work\" section. but they don't tend to present the same or similar projection modeling as the liberals or have quite as varied, all encompassing policies. the projection helps to demonstrate when the party intends each policy to take effect, how effective each policy will be over time, and what more we will need to do/add.

i am \\*not\\* saying that the ndp climate plan is a trash heap (that is reserved for the cpc) or even bad. its a decent plan - but the party would do well in the next election to invest in experts who can provide the empirical evidence to show that a) it will work to bring ghg down, and b) it will work with the timelines presented.  


its also not just me who has observed this.

the economy is growing again, but once again, government spending is far outpacing revenue. you could argue that this is okay, that improving social welfare is worth the cost. there's nothing fiscally irresponsible about spending more than the current tax base can support if you're also willing to take the political risk of raising taxes, but the liberals don't seem willing to do the latter.

unless we are on the verge of an economic boom, spending big without increasing taxes is not a real plan under traditional keynesian economics. but the liberals say they won't raise taxes, nor will they cut spending, nor will they reject traditional economics for something different like mmt. essentially, they're promising canadians northern europe style social spending with north american style taxes, which is dishonest at best. even tommy douglas balanced the books before implementing medicare, because he knew that sustainable social programs are founded on tax revenue, not deficits. but this government practices the worst kind of centrism, one which spends like the left and taxes like the right.",liberals

&gt;you're saying as n increases, deaths approaches p?

correct. 

in nova scotia, for example, the deaths per 100k double vaxed has been 0.1 per week. that's with 5.3 double vaxed cases per week. but if the variant is able to spread like crazy and it gets to more like 40 double vaxxed cases per week (which is around where the uk is), we're talking more like 1 death per 100k (0.93). per week. that's pretty god damn deadly. hence why they did a bunch of restrictions this week. 

one of the huge benefits of the vaccine is that it severely reduced the reproductive rate. that has gone out the window with omicron (and then some), so we either have to do something to slow it down or pray that it isn't nearly as deadly (which is very possible, and maybe even likely. that's a tough bet to make though)",liberals

- endeavouring to allow people to work from home whenever possible, meeting with our friends and family outside when we can, continuing to wear masks when distancing isn't possible, these are all just smart, reasonable decisions that will help us continue to be a healthy place, and keep us in a place where we can have kids in school (as an example of a really, really positive outcome). 

- expanding our \"get out the vaccine\" efforts to localized clinics, workplace clinics, etc to get a higher % fully vaccinated as fast as possible is also a really smart idea that will pay dividends.

- encouraging in-canada travel for vacations instead of going out-of-country to places where we can bring variants back (it's been shown that vaccinated people can still carry the virus, much like children).

\"singh campaigned for horgan.\" sure, just as trudeau campaigned with wynne, mcneil, ball, etc. i don't blame trudeau for the actions of the provincial parties he campaigns for, or vice versa, since, in the end, they're different parties. the actions that trudeau has sometimes taken contrary to that of those provincial party leaders aren't necessarily hypocritical. and even though the federal and provincial ndps are technically unified, the same is true here as well, since the practical state of the parties show a wide array of differences. (notably, singh didn't campaign for dissolution of government in b.c.) it's why provincial leaders like john horgan, rachel notley, and wab kinew all have significantly different policy positions despite being from the same party. 

more specifically, the provincial and federal landscapes are significantly different with bc; the bc greens are clearly to the left of the bc ndp, while the federal ndp is decidedly to the left of the gpc (in its current state). horgan called his election to force out to bc greens and create a more right-wing government. trudeau is doing the same by trying to force out the ndp (and to some extent the bq) and create a more right-wing government. above all else, it's a question about what the context dictates, and horgan's and trudeau's actions are contextually similar, albeit not identical, in this case.",liberals

but part of any agreement the liberals would want has to include being nicer in the house. the lpc have the position of power right now.  we all know the government isnt going to fall for awhile so anything they being forward will eventually be passed, supply agreement or not.  just like a few months ago. 

they're probably worried about the ndp reneging on the deal for political effect later on. pulling the rug out from the government would be a fun headline for the opposition, particularly if an election is coming.

later, in may 2021 when it became clear that there was going to be a fall election, the ndp again refused to fast track it so that it could be announced and passed in june in time for pride day. it remained mired in committee and then was off to the senate without a fast-track - where it died on third reading as of today when the writ was dropped.

this was absolutely the fault of the ndp who obstructed all gov't bills that were not directly related to the pandemic for a period of five months. this was one of them. when it became clear that this parliament was going to end this fall, they did nothing again to help movie it forward into law. they let the cpc block it and refused to lend their aid to move c-6 forward. singh will be complaining about how unnecessary this election was and what important legislation remained to be done -- but was left to die so that trudeau could pursue this election for power.
