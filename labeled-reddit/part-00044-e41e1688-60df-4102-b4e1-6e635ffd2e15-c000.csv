this requires public key cryptography which i won't explain but is a very well understood domain.

here is a simple example:

1. you as a traveler go online to your provincial health authority and print a qr code vaccination record. this record would include your name, date of birth, and other standard information to verify your id. it would also include your vaccination status. it would be signed with the province's 'private key'.
2. you go to the boarder and they ask for your vaccination record.
3. they scan your qr code record which will display for them your id which they validate against your normal passport.
4. the same app will pull the province's 'public key' to verify the signature.
5. they check that the app says you are vaccinated and you continue your trip.

this system is great because the consent and sharing of information is restricted to the patient. only you decide who this information is shared with.

this is also secure. for most people you can implement this with a piece of paper you can not forge this document. public key cryptography prevents that. if somebody tries to make a fake qr code then the signature will show that.

the only data that needs to be accessed by the scanning app is the list of signing public keys. globally you could probably fit this in a few ten's of megabytes so it can even be done offline.",liberals

i understand that the 'hot take' headline of 'conservatives reject reality of climate change!' isn't accurate, but this more nuanced view of the convention _isn't better_.

a demand that polluting businesses take responsibility is the most anodyne language i can think of.  it would certainly seem to be a good fit for the party of personal responsibility &amp;ndash; the language doesn't even call for coercive government action.

gsopkdf,2021-03-28T23:39:10.000-07:00,"ready — or not? an analysis of how the canadian government managed a year of covid-19 this is a very fair and accurate assessment which everyone should consider reading in full imo.

some key parts:

&gt;the trudeau government made assumptions it never should have — like presuming that vaccines wouldn’t materialize until 2021, so quarterly 2021 deliveries would be just fine, thank you.

&gt;the auditor general says border agents acted to enforce measures after they were finally brought in, but the public health agency had little capacity to ensure compliance. in the early going, it did not know whether two-thirds of incoming travellers followed quarantine orders.

&gt;but by feb. 11, not two weeks later, when a second canadian plane carrying evacuees from the quarantined region of hubei, china, landed at cfb trenton, the who changed its advice and said there is a “public health rationale” for restrictions to contain the virus. border measures could help non-affected countries “gain time to initiate and implement effective preparedness measures,” the who said, adding they should be “reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.”

&gt;yet it wasn’t until mar. 13, more than a month afterwards, that the federal government told canadians to avoid non-essential travel.

&gt;federal health authorities and government leaders did not absorb a key lesson of the previous sars 2003 and the 2009 h1n1 epidemics: you have to adopt the “precautionary principle” in everything you do. it takes time for science to reflect the reality of a virus’s rapid spread. and by that time, if you didn’t take precautions, you’re already in a deadly game of catch-up.

&gt;as a result, canada was slow to recognize the ability of sars-cov-2 to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers. slow to acknowledge its transmission via small, exhaled particles that become aerosolized, not just by large droplets. slow to change course on recommendations for medical mask-wearing for health and long-term care workers on the front lines, and for the public. and slow to see temperature scanners or rapid tests as useful screening aids for international travellers.

the article is long so there are lots of other points and even a few ways in which our response was considered good (mainly  cerb) but obviously i can't include everything and suggest people read it for themselves.",liberals

so to your childish rant-fest. first, claiming he'll cut temp workers has fuck all to do with immigration. and saying 'the border loophole must be closed' is not an indication of how he intends to do it given the courts say we must give every applicant a hearing.

as to him cutting back on immigration - not happening. he's a toronto-centric elitist.

 *he is a rare example of a conservative  mp who has repeatedly won re-election in the 905, the swath of suburban  ridings surrounding toronto, named after its area code. many of those  ridings have large numbers of immigrants, and immigration was a topic  mr. o’toole discussed at length.*

*“i  have fought back against voices out there that want to curtail  immigration, because immigration is critical to our success,” he said.*

 *while conservatives typically support recruiting new canadians from the  economic stream, to fill labour shortages and drive entrepreneurship,  mr. o’toole focused on the family reunification stream.*

come in noah zatzman, a green party advisor especially close to paul, who then tweets about manly and atwin, calling them racists and anti-semites and vowing to get them replaced with zionists during the next electoral cycle. the party membership is outraged and calls for his resignation, his contract is not renewed but he is not fired and paul doesn't comment on the issue. atwin decides to leave the party over its lack of leadership and crosses the floor over to the liberal party, may and manly both release statements blaming paul for it.

so manly and may are unsatisfied with paul, the green voters (the online ones at least) are up in arms, and the greens just lost a third of their caucus. the drama and in-fighting is likely to harm them in the polls and might relegate them to may's seat alone, undoing the progress the party made under may's leadership.

trump did not like trudeau, and he definitely didn't like biden... do you think they were calling us canadians or biden to talk about how this would all work? 

trumps regime burnt records and withheld much information from the biden admin, remember how he wouldn't leave even though he lost? lol.... its crazy how fast people forget stuff. 

not trying to make this a usa problem, i'm just a fan of going back all the way to where things began. 

this is only speculation but i fully belive the means and motive were there for trump to purposely sabotage this whole thing, keep the next people coming in as much in the dark as possible just so it would go completely sideways and he would have something to point at (in the present) and say \"look how bad biden fucked up\" to his rally goers. canada probably wasn't even a thought in any of it.

suffice it to say, china was not happy with canada’s actions. shortly after she was arrested, china detained two canadian citizens in china (michael kovrig and michael spavor) on fairly dubious charges; the general consensus is that this was an act of retaliation for meng’s arrest, although china won’t admit that of course. they also slapped some sanctions on canadian canola exports, among other things. 

as things stand now, the us application for meng’s extradition is still pending, the two michaels are still imprisoned, and china-canada relations are... not good, to say the least. trudeau has been forced into a very difficult diplomatic situation; angering china too much could endanger the two michaels and risk further retaliation, but giving in would effectively send a message that hostage diplomacy works.",liberals

gnupnb8,2021-02-17T12:48:46.000-08:00,"analysis: norway, the uk and canada are not climate champions. they are climate hypocrites yes they absolutely need to stop breeding so much, and a major reason for why they are is their complete failure to adequately tackle poverty, provide adequate women's rights (or all human rights for that matter), and provide enough education and upward social mobility, which is mostly due to a blend of widespread corruption, authoritarianism, or backwards-ass religious/cultural beliefs. 

canada is pretty damn well a world leader in poverty reduction, education, women's rights, lgbtq rights, and environmental regulations (not perfect by far, but still dned good), so while i think it's important we work towards a shift away from oil and towards a greener future, i absolutely do not agree that we need to bend over backwards or arguably cut off our own legs in the process when at the end of the day us being net zero won't make a goddamned lick of a difference since developing nations will more than make up for it anyways... 

and while doing so, guess who gets more rich and more powerful on a global scale? those who stand openly against the values of western liberal democracies, while we virtue signal ourselves into destitution and make no difference in the end.

killing out oil industry does fuck all to fix the demand problem. at least we are actually working to do something about that and have a rapidly growing green energy and green tech economy. not to mention that the oilsands themselves are also actively trying to reduce their emissions, and have by about 30% since 1990, and will continue to do so, potentially with the aide of small scale nuclear reactors (credit to the feds and to kenney not rejecting something from the liberals for idealogically driven political points for once).

so if you really only care about what canada does, the give your country some credit of all it does... not take a dump on it for small fraction of what it does (oilsands emissions are less than 8% or our total emissions btw... killing them still won't take away the other 92% of emissions).

- this policy will actually be a bigger burden on the poor, as there is no longer a rebate that you can spend on food and bills and other necessities. 

- this policy will pick winners and losers by who the government allows on the approved products list.

- as the rebate is no longer flat and related to consumption, this will by definition require more administration and cost more to implement.

one of the largest issues with the rise of right wing populism in western politics is that a large amount of politicians kind of hitched onto the ideology and echo chambers. certain forces realized they could effectively weaponize social media and media platforms to good (bad) effect. because of this it made more of the progressive rw politicians either ease off and toe the line or end up as pariahs in a party racing towards radicalization or straight up regression. 

by taking a stand and acknowledging the need for carbon pricing and not wanting to fight a zero sum war with the other parties he’s effectively drawn a line as a party leader, hopefully enabling other actual progressive conservatives to step up with him. irregardless, it’s going to do probably do one of two things. 

it’ll either shut up the socon base that’s eaten up the idea that we can’t have comprehensive environmental taxes, pricing schemes, etc because they’ll be afraid of splitting and never holding government again.

or

it’ll straight up split the parties between pcs and  socons and create a lot of independent/3rd party mps. 

i suspect that the first one is more likely than the second; simply because the socon side of the party was really relying on this idea that the party leader him or herself wouldn’t push back hard on their stances; and let them go unchallenged. being under the cpc umbrella is a safe place to be as a socon because it’s a symbiotic relationship. you may only account for 20% of the vote, but that 20% can make it or break it during an election year. it’s also assured that you can at least hold some semblance of power; whereas without the cpc umbrella, you’d likely have as much as the green party.",conservatives

this is not an on/off switch issue. it needs to be worked towards over a period of time. this is what i believe they are attempting to do with part of the plan you guys are discussing here. 

the idea of using a % of your fuel consumption (that you really don't currently have a choice to consume) to invest in home improvements, ev's or other eco-friendly technologies is a good incentive for consumers. the argument that this somehow favors more consumption is ridiculous. no one is going to go out and tank up a couple more times a week to accumulate additional carbon savings, especially not with current fuel prices.

* making 30% of individual transport zero emissions in the next 9 years
* strengthening north american vehicle emission standards
* investing in much-needed energy transmission infrastructure (for ev's)
* investing in ev manufacturing inside canada, improving ev battery recycling (a huge environmental issue not many people talk about)

but at the same time, you know what would stop embarrassing motions that force liberals to vote against pharmacare, vote against a wealth tax, etc. from happening? implementing pharmacare and a wealth tax.

it's long past due. with pharmacare they've promised it themselves endlessly!  and they've had plenty of power and opportunity to pursue implementing it in whatever way they think it can be done. but instead they continue to occupy government in this country for decades and not get anything done, all while cynically getting votes off the idea that potentially finally maybe they will implement policies of obvious and urgent necessity such as pharmacare or fair taxation of wealth.

so i don't really feel bad for the liberals being put in a no win position here. i wish the ndp's motions were better for the ndp's own sake, but i'm happy that they're hammering the government on these things and i really don't care to hear liberals defensively complaining that x motion isn't constitutional for y reason or whatever. it might be true, but i don't care. get pharmacare done or leave office.",liberals

first, there's a late-campaign platform drop. this has worked well for liberals in previous elections, but i am not sure it's the right approach for this one. as i've said elsewhere, a year of lockdowns has habituated people into thinking that you need a pretty damn good reason just to walk out your front door. now the liberals are telling canadians that we must go to the polls two years early, in the midst of a fourth wave, because we have very serious issues which only a majority mandate will allow them to properly address.

okay, fine.

but if that's the story you're going to tell, people will quite understandably expect you to be ready on day one with a compelling plan addressing the very serious issues. in other words, *you need to have a platform*. and piecemeal policy announcements that don't obviously hang together around some coherent organizing principle or theme are no substitute, especially when they often appear reactive to what the other parties are proposing.

second, there's the fearmongering about the big blue bogeyman, with his (((secret agenda))) to privatize healthcare, criminalize abortion, and clear-cut old growth forests to make clubs to beat trans kids (or whatever). this has been standard liberal operating procedure at least since the martin era. 

but here's the rub: if the stakes are really as high as the liberals *need us to believe they are* (because if we don't, a snap election becomes nothing more than a transparent power grab), then surely now is the worst possible time to risk putting the big blue bogeyman in charge. in the absence of a platform or some other compelling narrative explaining why it was so damned important to have an election *right now*, ginning up fear of the tories is ultimately self-defeating, because you don't have an answer to the fundamental question: if they're so awful, why open the door for them two years ahead of schedule?",liberals

brain drain, though it is a problem, i don't think there is anything that we can do about it. as a social democracy, we try and keep everybody between the poverty limit and whatever that high point we set through regulation and taxation. unfortunately setting these limits stifles innovation. if every country in the world followed this philosophy, innovation would seize. 

we, as well as all the other social democracies, directly benifit from the united states winner takes all mentality. we get direct access to the cool new things, yet don't have to worry about the crippling social issues (as much). we can't have it both ways, losing people who believe money is everything to a system perpetuating that belief is enevitable. thinking that suddenly we can be compeditive in the game of capitalism is silly. 

as to remain relevant, we need to be publicly funding innovation, while ensuring future conservative governments don't sell the results off for pennies on the dollar. 

if we had nationalized vaccine development and manufacturing capacity we would be ahead in the pandemic by months. 

if we had a nation-wide public transportation initiative we would have lower ghg emissions, better inter/intracity transportation and rely on personal vehicles less. 

if we had focused on building sustainable domestic manufacturing capabilities we wouldn't rely on shipments of junk from china. 

if we had nationalized energy companies, we wouldn't be funnelling \"private\" money into foreign bank accounts but instead be sitting a trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund.  

that's how we compete, we keep the money here, and use innovation to enrich the lives of canadians. if we lose a few brains along the way to hopes and dreams so be it. nationalism isn't always a bad thing. i would rather we move closer to the nordic models where everybody is well taken care of, happiness is the highest in the world, and the people are healthy.

on that note the olp definitely deserves a far worse memory than the ndp under rae does, but that's not even today's ndp. so while it's probably true that some people won't vote for the ndp based on rae's term, there are plenty of valid reasons to never vote for that party.

if you actually look at how people voted and why, [among the 3 major parties, the ndp and liberals had almost the same % of people who would never consider voting for them](https://www.campaignresearch.com/single-post/2018/02/22/analysis-of-voter-support-ceilings-for-major-ontario-parties)

also the schools have become more brazen than ever during that time in allowing teachers to impose their agenda on students not just through the curriculum but in  the complete absence of accountability for doing so. this is unethical regardless of who does it.

this borders on a government-backed cultural shift, in my opinion.

they also dramatically increased the number of people living on government subsidy and assistance. for example, odsp went from about 280,000 in 2003 to over 475,000 in late 2016. you think those people are ever going to vote for a conservative?

&gt; **tories vow to protect rights of doctors with moral objections to abortion, maid**

&gt; ottawa -- conservative leader erin o'toole is promising to protect the right of health care professionals to refuse to provide or even refer patients for medical services to which they have moral or religious objections.

&gt; the promise to protect conscience rights -- a measure championed by social conservatives who maintain doctors and nurses should not have to refer patients for services like abortion, medical assistance in dying or gender re-assignment surgery -- is included in the conservatives' election platform.

&gt; the platform was released this week by o'toole even as he tries to differentiate himself from his predecessor, andrew scheer, whose socially conservative views on abortion and lgbtq rights arguably cost the conservatives the 2019 election.

&gt; \"the conservative party has not always been clear about its position on social issues,\" o'toole acknowledged in a speech wednesday evening in quebec, where suspicion of social conservatism runs high.

&gt; \"i want to be very clear with you. i am pro-choice and i've always been pro-choice.\"

&gt; but the platform's promise to protect conscience rights reflects the circle o'toole is attempting to square as he tries to broaden his party's appeal without losing the support of social conservatives, who were crucial to his winning leadership bid and who make up a significant chunk of his caucus and his party's base.

&gt; it states simply: \"we will protect the conscience rights of health care professionals.\"

&gt; it offers no details but appears to suggest the measure is needed to prevent doctors who have objections to medical assistance in dying from quitting the profession or leaving canada, as some have threatened to do.

&gt; \"the challenges of dealing with covid-19 have reminded us of the vital importance of health care professions -- the last thing canada can afford to do is drive any of these professionals out of their profession,\" the platform says. \"we will also encourage faith-based and other community organizations to expand their provision of palliative and long-term care.\"

&gt; however, social conservatives have been clear they see protection of conscience rights applying to a broad range of medical services, not just assisted dying.

&gt; during a 2019 ontario court case, services to which various doctors' groups and individual physicians said they would object included abortion, contraception, tubal ligations, vasectomies, infertility treatment, prescription of erectile dysfunction medication and gender re-assignment surgery, as well as assisted dying.

&gt; the case involved a constitutional challenge to the ontario college of physicians and surgeons requirement that doctors who morally object to a service must provide patients with an \"effective referral\" to another doctor who does not have such qualms. the challenge was spearheaded by the christian medical and dental society of canada, canadian physicians for life and the canadian federation of catholic physicians societies, who were joined by a number of individual doctors and intervener groups.

&gt; they argued that the college's policy violated doctors' right to freedom of conscience and religion, forcing them to be complicit in providing services they believe to be morally wrong. they lost the initial 2017 case but appealed. the ontario court of appeal upheld the lower court ruling in 2019.

&gt; \"it is impossible to conceive of more private, emotional or challenging issues for any patient,\" ontario's chief justice, george strathy, wrote in the unanimous appeal court ruling after enumerating all the services to which the appellants objected.

&gt; allowing doctors to refuse to provide referrals for those services would stigmatize already vulnerable patients, leave them to navigate the complex health system on their own and restrict their access to medical services, he said.

&gt; \"given the importance of family physicians as 'gatekeepers' and 'patient navigators' in the health care system, there is compelling evidence that patients will suffer harm in the absence of an effective referral,\" strathy wrote.

&gt; in the case of assisted dying, abortion and emergency contraception, he said, \"delay in accessing these procedures can prevent access to them altogether.\"

&gt; moreover, strathy added: \"one can reasonably anticipate that the loss of the personal support of a trusted physician would leave the patient with feelings of rejection, shame and stigma.\"

&gt; regardless of that ruling, o'toole courted social conservatives in last year's conservative leadership race with a promise to protect \"the conscience rights of all health care professionals whose beliefs, religious or otherwise, prevent them from carrying out or referring patients for services that violate their conscience.\"

&gt; the platform promise is not as precise about protecting health care professionals' right to refuse to make referrals. a party spokesman refused to \"speculate\" about the change in wording, saying only that \"our platform language stands.\"

&gt; the platform also promises that a conservative government \"will not support any legislation to regulate abortion.\"

&gt; however, o'toole has been clear that he won't try to stop conservative mps from proposing their own private member's bills to restrict abortion and can vote as they please on them. in june, a majority of his caucus supported such a bill to ban sex-selective abortions.

&gt; the platform also promises to outlaw conversion therapy, the discredited practice of forcing children or adults to undergo therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation or gender identity.

&gt; unlike a liberal bill to ban the practice which over half the conservative caucus voted against in june, the platform says the tories would clarify that \"non-coercive conversations\" about a person's sexual identity would not be criminalized, \"giving comfort to parents and others\" who counsel them.

&gt; the liberal bill was passed by the house of commons in june, after months of conservative delaying tactics. the senate did not have time to deal with it before adjourning for the summer and the bill died once the election was called.",conservatives

not whatsoever. i'll let others here be the judge of who is arguing in bad faith when such a obvious strawman gets used almost immediately.

how is asking for a consistent and objective definition for the term \"assault weapon\" muddying the waters or arguing in bad faith? again, it's thrown around so casually i would hope that people could at least agree on what \"assault weapon\" means so we're all talking about the same thing when we speak of banning them.

&gt;onto your comment about playing games with definitions. first, it’s irrelevant when (as i mentioned above) these things are clearly listed and itemized.

when you look up a definition of something in a dictionary, it doesn't give you a list of all of the things that fit that definition. don't you think it's important to be able to agree on common terminology in a consistent manner in order to have a constructive discussion? 

&gt; second, it’s incredibly disingenuous to suggest it’s “the other side” is playing this game. it’s pro-gun people and gun manufacturers that have caused the confusion and now attempt to leverage that confusion and point (still irrelevant) fingers.

that's a rather outstanding claim. how do pro-gun people benefit from creating confusion amongst those who are against private firearms ownership? most pro-gun folks in canada want everyone to learn more about our laws, because if they did they would realize that we already have a very robust system for controlling who has access to firearms.

i feel that i was being quite reasonable in asking the questions i did. do you not agree that if we can arrive at a consistent definition for what constitutes an \"assault weapon\" or, in other terms, a firearm that is unsuitable for private ownership, we would be better able to regulate them?

here's my greater theory, and sorry if it sounds a little conspiratorial: we know that canadian conservatives have been working with american republicans. canada's existence in its current form puts pressure on america to end the current screwjob that its citizens endure (health care, unnecessary police hassle through the criminalization of marijuana, abject lack of social safety nets, and so on). the republicans have shown themselves as having one true goal: ripping off the american public in the most contemptuous way possible. there's no way that they don't want to make that a north american movement.",conservatives

at second glance, the polls did better than what i analyzed them last night as, with mainstreet actually managing to capture all three major parties within their moe-- but only just barely for the pcs. even the forum failed at this. 

right now, with 338's current numbers (it hasn't updated for the 18th just yet), the lpc has roughly a 9 in 10 chance of winning the most seats, with the cpc having a 1 in 10 chance. this isn't so far off from the predictions we saw for the ns election, and i'd be worried, if i was trudeau, that any cpc numbers are actually at the upper bounds of any particular poll, if not exceeding them, and the lpc are down much lower than the means suggest. 

i'll grant that the election has literally just started, and a lot can change over the course of it. i actually suspect this is a major contributing factor to what we saw in the ns election; a couple of days ago a man died because the ambulance took something like 3 hours to show up, and on monday another man died in the er from diabetes. so there was actually a lot of very recent failures on the part of the liberal government here. 

but that said, i worry that trudeau is intending to run more of his pandemic management and proposed recovery from the pandemic, when people are more interesting in other issues. it wouldn't surprise me if the lpc warroom is rethinking and reassessing what they're going to prioritize about the election, and a lack of time might ultimately hurt them.",liberals

h48uj17,2021-07-06T01:19:24.000-07:00,"mary simon named as canada's first indigenous governor general it can give us the opportunity for a great deal of clarity when we bother to face our fears and open this constitution. parties have said for months they are speculating about an election at any time, even though a motion of no confidence is nowhere close to being passed. there shouldn´t be this kind of speculation that paralyzes a parliament we already elected for so long. a useful president who has the spine to resist a prime minister, currently their only source of democratic legitimacy, could refuse to call a snap election where nobody passed a vote of no confidence yet or could get the other parties to see if they could do better.

presidents also have the legitimacy to apply some vetoes to bills when they are truly independent, with the ability to make parliament say again they support it, not necessarily by a supermajority but simply reaffirming that they want to pass it, potentially the president could highlight a specific clause to be sent back and voted as a specific line item and not the whole bill take it or leave it. they can also send it to court to see if it is constitutional. nine times in the last 72 years, more than once per decade, german presidents have vetoed bills this way, and everyone knows that passing a bill that is unconstitutional has this president willing to stand in their way and so has a chilling effect we don´t see. our governors general have literally never used their veto power because they have no spine. 

they can also refuse to appoint illegal appointments, or to dismiss someone it would be illegal to dismiss, where the governor generals of today have no such ability to do so in practice. the italian president a couple years ago prohibited the appointment of someone who was going to illegally violate a binding treaty. if they had disagreed with that interpretation they could have taken the president to court but they didn´t because they knew it was a waste of time, but had such an appointment been made and only contested in the interim, damage could have been done. 

they can actually refuse to prorogue parliament, which erased all the progress elected mps made last year on bills like banning conversion therapy which is now virtually impossible to pass in this 43rd parliament and so people need to wait even longer. reform of this gives more power to the backbench and the opposition to do things and to unite to pass bills, and ensures that they meet frequently to interrogate the prime minister and cabinet and meet in committees. same with calling them into session, which trudeau delayed for months wasting precious time before a parliament that could realistically challenge him. 

they would also be the one person elected across all of canada, directly, and likely with a majority vote required. given the turnout last election, assuming the same figure, that would be one person with almost nine and a half million votes, three million more than the prime minister got last time for his party. it would give some truth that at least one person is more prestigious than the prime minister and they have to comply with statutes if they want to do things.  it would mean something when someone gets some award from the head of state, where today it is meaningless to get such an award from someone so impotent and politically irrelevant like the governor general or queen. at least the queen is famous; the governor general is not unless they are in a scandal where even fewer people want an award from them.

this is why i cannot believe in the utility of a governor general not elected by at least a parliament if not the people.",liberals

i'd say they're primarily slowly, painfully, pulled in two separate directions by their two eco-capitalist and eco-socialist divisions which are roughly 60%\\~ and \\~40% respectively. the former group includes may and paul, and is why they get the 'neoliberals on bikes' stereotype.

edit: expanding a bit. the left-right spectrum generally refers to economic policy. someone (like myself) who identifies as a leftist wants workers to control and own the means of production, someone who wants capital to control and own it goes on the right. the spectrum is formed by all the positions in between like being pro-union and still supporting capitalism (weird but okay), or wanting laws like germany's mitbestimmung.

the greens are considered centrist (like actually centrist, not right wing like the lpc, cpc, or people that can flip between those two parties) because their platform generally doesn't strengthen labour or capital's position over the economy. i would consider them slightly left of center. their 2019 platform includes these small (but important) things:

* legalizing sex work
* rejecting back-to-work laws

if they were really leftist i would expect to see full-throated support for unions and further (or full!) unionization of the workforce, laws like the mitbestimmung so that half (or more!) of all board-members were delegates of the workers, and so on.",liberals

allegation of non-confidence in the leadership of annamie paul

whereas:

the gpc constitution, appendix a, participatory democracy, requires “that all elected representatives are committed to transparency, truthfulness and accountability in governance”; and

the gpc constitution requires that the party leader act as an active, contributing member of federal council, equal to other members of federal council; and

the gpc federal council code of conduct requires that councillors, including the leader, are required to hold the party’s interests above their individual self-interest, to not use insulting, harassing or offensive behaviour, to not act in a way that brings the party into disrepute, to always act to the highest ethical standards and to conduct themselves honestly and in a spirit of collegiality, valuing the opinions of other councillors and seeking common ground; and

the gpc member code of conduct prohibits any member, including the leader or their staff, from degrading, undermining, working against or permitting attacks on party mps.

and whereas:

since her election as leader, annamie paul has acted with an autocratic attitude of hostility, superiority and rejection, failing to assume her duty to be an active, contributing, respectful, attentive member of federal council, failing to develop a collaborative working relationship, failing to engage in respectful discussions, and failing to use dialogue and compromise. she has attended few council meetings, and when in attendance, has displayed anger in long, repetitive, aggressive monologues and has failed to recognize the value of any ideas except her own, acting in a manner not in compliance with the leader’s role and responsibilities as outlined in the constitution, bylaws, and codes of conduct of the green party of canada; and

annamie paul has rejected transparency stating that “transparency is not the way to go” to a staff meeting on june 11; and

annamie paul misrepresented her relationship with caucus to the media, claiming that there was a good relationship when in fact annamie’s relationship with caucus is hostile, autocratic and dismissive. she has ignored caucus efforts to communicate, placed a gag order on caucus, preventing them from talking to the media and from correcting false information, stated to staff on june 11 that mp jenica atwin’s statement of approved policy was an “attack on the authority of the leader”, ignored caucus concerns, and treated caucus in ways that any reasonable person would know to be unwelcome; and

annamie specifically placed a gag order on the mps, but allowed her senior advisor to talk freely and repeatedly to the media, publishing false information that degraded and undermined the mps; and

annamie paul has failed to protect and support gpc mps. she has brought the party into disrepute and degraded, undermined and worked against its mps by issuing an incorrect press statement against the advice of gpc mps and permitting her chief advisor, noah zatzman, to then engage in character assassination of gpc mps in the media. subsequently annamie paul:

- failed to intervene,

- failed to stop her advisor's further attacks,

- failed to refute her advisor's words to the media or to party members,

- failed to apologize to mps for the damage done to their reputations and their ability to serve their constituents,

- stated that green mp jenica atwin was \"not worth a phone call from me\",

- stated that “zatzman is my friend” (june 11),

- not admitted her part in mp jenica atwin's departure from the gpc; and

annamie paul misrepresented her actions to the media, failing to admit that her own failure to stop her staff from attacking mps was the direct cause of all actions by mp jenica atwin; and that she herself had plenty of time to respond to mp jenica atwin before taking her own personal leave of absence but chose not to respond; and that she failed to attend all caucus meetings except one during the zatzman crisis; and that when mp jenica atwin asked why her messages had not been answered, annamie paul replied “i got your messages; i just did not want to talk to you.”

and whereas:

annamie paul has developed a personal reputation for dishonesty which gives opposition parties the ability to compromise her election and which harms the reputation of the gpc and the gpc's ability to elect candidates and to re-elect mps; and

members are openly calling for the leader, annamie paul, to step down, citing a failure of the leader to lead; and

federal councillors have been inundated by calls to take action on this immediately. over 2000 letters have been received from gpc members concerned about her actions or demanding the resignation or removal of leader; and

general donations have declined, and significant numbers of monthly donors have cancelled their donations citing the leader’s recent behaviour as the reason; and

candidates and eda officers have resigned, citing the leader’s actions and behaviour as the reason.

therefore be it resolved that since annamie paul has damaged the interests of the gpc, brought the party into disrepute, and is in violation of the gpc constitution, bylaws, members code of conduct and the federal council code of conduct, this federal council has lost confidence in annamie paul’s leadership of the gpc and puts a motion of non-confidence to the members in general meeting and through a leadership review.

chronology of the character assassination of green mps

they have never taken attacks on marginalized groups seriously enough.

i was mistaken when i said you were incorrect about the ns shooter not using a mini 14. i somehow thought he used a different weapon. i apologize for leading us down a useless path.

with that being said, we should take these things in context. there have been millions of mini 14s produced worldwide in multiple variations . one of its variants was touted as a cheap and reliable firearm for pest control and was marketed towards ranchers. there are an estimated 6000 restricted mini 14 rifles, and an untold amount of non-restricted variants in canada. with all those rifles, only two have been used to comit mass murder in canada. it is far more likely that the mini 14 was chosen is because of its availability and not anything specific to do with its design. 

our gun control laws are not 100% effective, and i do believe there are areas that could be improved to make it more difficult for deranged people to get a gun license and purchase a firearm, but let's not decieve ourselves into thinking that banning certain rifles will stop mass murder. all it will do is make us feel safer while the root cause festers and lashes out in another way.

you only need to look at list of [massacres that occurred in the uk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_great_britain?wprov=sfla1)  and compare the rate of massacres before and after their 1997 gun ban. it's clear that the frequency didn't change, only the means.

the cold hard fact is that some people in our country are mentally unstable. if you want to be effective in stopping their tragedies before they happen, you need to create an environment where they feel safe, included, and validated. that is where the journey to stable mental health begins.

on the other hand the anti-gun lobby tends to paint the other side with the same villainous brush. what this does is take someone who is on the fringes of radicalization and push them further away from society, making them feel less safe, included and validated.

netflix, etc. also already fund canadian programming, have points systems, etc.

this is a canada that just promotes larger established services over smaller ones.

looking back at the april 23rd meeting's minutes, it kind of looks like the motion to remove that language from the bill was agreed to without a vote because no one thought it was actually a problem. 

actually, going through the evidence on [ourcommons.ca](https://www.ourcommons.ca/documentviewer/en/43-2/chpc/meeting-26/evidence) provides a bit of insight into what appears to be going on. at one point, kevin waugh, cpc mp says:
&gt;**mr. kevin waugh:**

&gt;    thank you, mr. chair.

&gt;    this was one of the main things i brought up during testimony. we are seeing a lot of non-broadcasters going on facebook and so on. even now youtube has major league baseball and yesterday offered a game with the houston astros on youtube.

&gt;    could i get a ruling from the department on this, as we are actually seeing more and more former broadcasters going on facebook. i think cpc-5 is a very important amendment i see going forth with this broadcasting act.

a moment later, thomas ripley responds:
&gt;**mr. thomas owen ripley:**

&gt;    right now, as bill c-10 currently stands—and as the committee is aware—it excludes social media services from the ambit of the act, unless there's a situation of an affiliation contract or a mandatary relationship in place.

&gt;    **cpc-5, if it was adopted—if i understand correctly the spirit of the amendment—would impose certain limitations on that to the effect that if a social media service crossed a certain threshold in terms of the users of the service, the subscribers in canada, etc., then suddenly it would get pulled into the ambit of the act and would be subject to the act like any other broadcasters. in other words, the social media exclusion would not apply to them.**

&gt;    if i understand correctly from the debate that's currently taking place, as ms. dabrusin has signalled, the government intends to suggest the repeal of proposed section 4.1 altogether, meaning that there would no longer be any exclusion for social media services at all.

&gt;    just maybe for the benefit of the committee, in our previous sessions the committee upheld the exclusion for individual users of social media companies. in other words, when you or i upload something to youtube or some other sharing service, we will not be considered broadcasters for the purposes of the act. in other words, the crtc couldn't call us before them, and we couldn't be subject to crtc hearings and whatnot.

&gt;    however, if the exclusion here is removed and 4.1 is struck down, the programming we upload onto youtube, the programming we place on that service, would be subject to regulation moving forward but would be the responsibility of youtube or whatever the sharing service is. that programming that is uploaded, then, could be subject to things like discoverability requirements or certain obligations like that.

&gt;    again, if the way forward ultimately is to maintain the exclusion for individual users but to strike down the exclusion for social media companies, it means that all the programming that is on those services would be subject to the act, regardless of whether it's put there by an affiliate or a mandatary of the company.

&gt;    i hope that helps clarify.

i get the impression that the problem the committee is trying to tackle here is that many broadcasters have been moving into an online space-- but specifically they've been moving onto places like youtube rather than a streaming service. both youtube and netflix can be considered streaming services, *but*, because of how section 4.1 is worded, if you're a broadcaster and chose to just upload everything to youtube, you'd be outside of crtc regulations because it would be \"user generated content\" (despite being a real life baseball game or whatever). the cpc proposed an amendment that would rope in people who reached a certain threshold of subscribers and revenue (250k+ and 50 million or more in advertising/sponsership/etc in canada), but that amendment to the section was voted down in favor of just removing the exception all together. i assume it was partly voted down because the amendment seems to be really easy to game. 

and to be fair, when put into this context, it really does seem like a massive loophole in the bill that a broadcaster (like, and actual legit broadcaster) could just sidestep crtc rules by pretending to be a user of a social media site to stream its programs.",liberals

first generation canadians from minority communities who immigrated to canada under trudeau sr's regime credit his administration for expanding canada's europe-centric economic immigration programs, and giving them \"a shot\" at a better life in canada for them and their families.  they were very loyal to the liberals... so i guess the outcome was like their votes were bought? 

the cp under harper was right to question this loyalty and try to articulate in what ways the values of first generation canadians aligns with the cp.

i think what's missing in their strategy is the second and third generations (now gen-xers and millennials). party loyalty can be inherited, and i feel like the liberals are trying to secure the loyalty of subsequent generations through lame ass superficial binary discourse about matters of race. 

what i'd want the cp to recognize is that these subsequent generations are urbanized, likely socially moderate, but have also likely inherited values about wealth-building and pursuing prosperity and prestigious careers and the cp is missing an opportunity to appear relevant to them if their strategy for the 'visible minority' vote is advertising social conservatism.

i guess my point is, if minority voters tend to vote liberal, then the cp needs to do a better job at convincing them that the cp is relevant to them. sometimes i think the cp is actively trying to limit their audience to disgruntled steel workers, small prairie town residents, and baby boomer south asians.",liberals

a lot of people politize this in terms whos at fault (liberal or conservative). however, not to look back and assign blame but look at the current things trudeau has been severely lacking.

we simply even today havnt put the investment or urgency into building longterm capacity of  vaccine manufacturing.

sure he spent a few millions on building facilities to produce yet to be approved vaccines that are years away. there is no urgency to his actions and he prefers to ask around the world and beg for vaccines.

canada must secure its own  domestic supply! uk spent billions and didnt sprinkle millions here or there and we already have an idea of the vaccines that work the best. we know the other vaccines have harder time with booster shots (the way the body interacts with the dead virus and its memory from the previous vaccine)

he should be on the phone doing whatever it takes for mrna vaccine (pfizer or moderna)  to build a facility in canada. yes it will take time. no it wont happen over night. but we know with the slow rollout and the booster shots alot of nations need vaccines too not just canada.

however we can do more, in terms of ensuring we have supply of booster shots for variants and also to be apart of the global effort to get people vaccinated.

we should not be giving countries money to ship to canada and then ship to other nations we are one of most advanced nations on earth and can make it at home.

we need to mobilize like the second world war and all do whatever we can to end this pandemic globally. these double mutations in india threaten to destroy the vaccine effectiveness. the longer the world stays unvaccinated the more mutations will happen and the less effective the vaccine will become.

think of all the economic harm in the shutdown. we need to be more serious about this and stop waiting and begging  other nations for supply. we should be doing more for ourselves but also the world to end this pandemic we need stronger leadership.

ha7hazf,2021-08-24T06:36:06.000-07:00,"liberals will take aim at real-estate speculation, propose homebuyers’ ‘bill of rights’ in ambitious housing policy definitely. supply is a serious issue, but asset inflation is the real problem too. i believe theres two side to that equation:

1) money chasing housing
2) houses on the market

supply and asset inflation are both inter-related. so, they can either add houses to the market or reduce money in the market. 

i think it get a little complicated because any policy needs to consider the long term effect. severely limiting money in the market can reduce investment, preventing more houses from being built. this is partly how we got here, after 2008 enough money fled the market that no one wanted to build. loss of home builders can be tough to reverse.

as for reducing money in the market, it can either be through restrictions (foreign buyers, domestic investors), or through monetary policy (raise interest rates, reduce leverage). restrictions will help, but it's a short term solution.

the other problem is most monetary policies that reduce money in the market are deflationary. such as raising interest rates, fees, capital gains, etc. they are kind of like \"austerity measures\" for homeowners. nobody likes to see that their mortgage interest is higher, even if it's better for the overall economy.
