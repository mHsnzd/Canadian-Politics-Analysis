my examples were hydrogen, manufactured gasoline.

also, it might become the case that energy needs to be gathered (and stored) closer to the end users more than gathered in selected regions of the world and then transported 'half way' round the world to end users as it tends to be today.  that will create business opportunities to design, build and operate those facilities.  who better to do that than people who already have extensive experience in working with energy facilities.

&gt; you're also not juxtaposing your claim that the world's \"moving on\" while canada exports record crude oil volumes - during a pandemic.

sure?

if i look around on the interweb, i'm confident i can find a chart or graph or table that shows that renewables are displacing fossil fuels, certainly that coal is losing market share.  it seems that i could also find a chart or graph or table that shows that canada has exported record volumes of crude oil (during a pandemic) and other similar indicators that nothing is really changing.  if there really is going to be a transition, we are surely still in the early days.

it will be decades before we can look back and say \"yes, a transition did occur, and it clearly began in this year and was largely complete in this other year.\"  it will also be decades before we can look back and say 2020 would have been the ideal time for canada to jump on this or that trend.

i can even allow that there is a chance that all of this will 'blow over' and that the kxl project will rise from the grave and actually get built and that production from the oil sands will double.  it just doesn't seem that this is the most likely outcome, and so maybe canada should start making some plans that leverage the skills and abilities that today's energy workers do have.

and what is your stance here.  is climate change a thing, or more of a hoax, or other?  are ghg emissions a concern, or not really much of a problem at all, or other?  fifty years from now will energy production and consumption patterns be surprisingly similar to today, or very different, or other?  i'm interested.",liberals

wrong, the actual absence of such weapons in any canadian arsenal speaks to that desire perfectly fine, a nuclear weapon ban by canada is actually the incoherent part in the current global geopolitical context.

new start remains in place though it's hard to tell exactly how the 2021 renewal negotiations will go, relations between the us and russia have taken quite the dive since ~2009. around the edges though treaties are falling all over the place. the us pulled out of the abm treaty, russia pulled out of start ii ( this  put constraints on mirv warheads ), the inf treaty has fallen apart in the wake of us accusations that russia was violating it. on top of that while the roots of these treaties can be found in the cold war where the ussr and us were such dominant holders of such weapons china remains outside of this treaty framework.

with this a canadian signing or no signing is irrelevant, indeed the tpnw is irrelevant as it holds no sway over those who have nuclear weapons, it's a laudable goal but only really something that can be taken seriously in a radically different geopolitical context. the near-term options for making the nuclear weapons situation safer would be getting china signed up ( probably india and pakistan as well ) and getting the abm, inf and start ii treaties restored in limiting some of the more dangerous forms of nuclear weapons.",liberals

&gt; who gets to decide that?

obviously the countries with nuclear weapons

&gt; consider making the argument for biological or chemical weapons to be used against civilians. how many would be acceptable to have in one's armament?

from a theoretical perspective it seems clear that nuclear weapons have produced relative peace in the 20th century, but that they do increase existential risk.  from a practical perspective no single nation, group of nations, or international organization can force the nuclear armed nations to give up their nuclear arms.  i would also argue that biological weapons are far less targetable than nuclear weapons and don't really make sense militarily in basically any circumstance.  nuclear weapons can be targeted at military targets and a limited nuclear war is at least possible",liberals

as for nuclear weapons, your views are dangerously naive. have nuclear weapons decreased the chance of conventional warfare? probably, but this will only be true until it's not: the longer many countries hold onto their nuclear weapons, the more likely terminal nuclear war eliminates the species. the only logical course is to completely disarm nuclear weapons internationally which of course countries like the us are already obligated to do under the nuclear proliferation treaty, namely, \"pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals.\"

what one learns from reading experts like daniel ellsberg is that we have been very close to terminal nuclear war already, where systems have given false alarms, or where commands to launch nuclear armed weapons have been refused by the receiving officers. it is by sheer luck that we are not already living in a post-nuclear-apocalyptic world.

gjuhtmn,2021-01-19T00:57:24.000-08:00,"noam chomsky calls on justin trudeau to sign january 22's un nuclear ban treaty &gt;you views on chomsky are misguided. if you read or followed his work you would know his niche is exactly nuance

chomsky has a habit of making the things he agrees with synonymous with each other and creating universal boogiemen/arguments that simplify more complex issues. for instance he has a bad habit of conflating, capitalism, imperialisms and neoliberalism as being synonymous with one another and occasionally will utilize apologetic stances when addressing a state/group that happens to be opposed to the united states. (worst examples of this being his comments on pol pot and milosevic). in this regard, he cuts out the nuance and replaces it with an ideological slant that easily assigns blame for various socio-economic issues to an easy to identify source. often using the evidence to confirm his bias rather than basing his opinion off the evidence. this doesn't meant that he doesn't occasionally make points worth making, but his views are also deeply flawed in many cases.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the only logical course is to completely disarm nuclear weapons internationally which of course countries like the us are already obligated to do under the nuclear proliferation treaty, namely, \"pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of their nuclear arsenals.\"

that's not really logical at all. if were logical, it would already have occurred.  likewise, you're misrepresenting the proliferation treaty by ignoring that [it's designed to limit/stop the spread of nuclear arms proliferation](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) to npt countries, not end it in it's entirety (at least not legally speaking) .  the united states is considered one of the five nuclear weapons states in the agreement. all other signatories outside of those five are non-nw states and prohibited from acquiring them.

&gt;this will be true until it's not: \"peace\" until terminal nuclear war eliminates the species.

hypothetical speculation is not a logical retort to the evidence. fear that something will happen is not a guaranteed assurance.  particularly when the evidence shows that nuclear war is increasingly unlikely. particularly to the extent you're alluding it to be.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;what one learns from reading experts like daniel ellsberg is that we have been very close to terminal nuclear war already, where systems have given false alarms, or where commands to launch nuclear armed weapons have been refused by the receiving officers.

that evidence tends to invalidate the actually likelihood of nuclear war happening though  since the involved parties in each case did everything in their power during those situations to prevent that from happening. the odds also become increasingly unlikely in a post-cold war/post arms race  environment.

&gt;thus it is truly utopian thinking that we can have nuclear arms indefinitely and also not use them indefinitely

this reasoning doesn't follow because it's based on personal conjecture rather than evidence or logic.  in the past 75 years, only two nuclear weapons have been used in conventional conflict (with those two occurrences being enough to dissuade their use by any country in warfare since). between then and now, the global nuclear stockpile declined from over 70,000 at the height of the arms race to little more than 3,7000 presently (with [historical trends](https://ourworldindata.org/exports/number-of-nuclear-warheads-in-the-inventory-of-the-nuclear-powers_v2_850x600.svg) suggesting even more significant declines in global nuclear stockpiles in the coming decades).",liberals

hdo5vxq,2021-09-20T12:22:33.000-07:00,"discussion thread - the 44th canadian general election &gt;because the government’s idea of “incentives” for wind and solar producers was 20-year contracts at as much as triple the market rate for power. a report last year by the provincial auditor general, bonnie lysyk, found that ontarians shovelled out $9.2 billion more than necessary because of those deals. between 2006 and 2014, she found, consumers and businesses paid $37 billion above the market price of electricity (experts later noted some of that reflects the cost of upgrading infrastructure).  
  
worse, it must pay the green producers whether it needs the power or not. 

(some plants are not built and they are being paid. revenue amounts were guaranteed, so if ontarians consumed less, the \"world green tax\" would increase to compensate. they also cancelled a contract for power plants in oakville to hold on to seats. they had to pay 1 billion because someone in the liberals said they'd have to after the company had publicly stated they were not expecting anything.)

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;effectively, ontario pays to export electricity. because it has little capacity to store power, the province has been forced to pay generators hundreds of millions to reduce production, while dumping surplus electricity to neighbouring provinces and u.s. states for much less than what ratepayers shell out to have it generated (the difference in 2014 totalled almost $800 million). in extreme cases they actually had to pay others to take it. here’s the auditor general in 2014: “there were 1,952 hours in which the hourly ontario electricity market price was negative and ontario paid other exporters a net total of $32.6 million to take our power.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;having promised to balance the provincial budget while spending $29-billion on infrastructure, the liberals needed to find money, and fast. so they decided to sell off 60 per cent of hydro one, the crown corporation that transmits electricity throughout the province and distributes to 1.4 million households.  
  
that should raise about $9 billion, but it carries questions about whose interest will come first under the new model: the captive customers’ of hydro one? or the shareholders’? what recourse will ratepayers have if something goes wrong?",liberals

gt6ln8c,2021-04-02T07:36:14.000-07:00,"undrip will be implemented no matter political party in power: analyst the undrip was adopted by the un general assembly in [2007](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html). there were 144 countries in favour, 4 countries who voted against it, including canada, and 11 countries who abstained.

in 2016, ndp mp rameo saganash introduced a private members bill to adopt the undrip in canada. it [passed 3rd reading in 2018](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/votes/42/1/684?view=party), with all but the tories in favour. 

unfortunately it got stalled in the senate and thus died when the election was called. 

last year, in december 2020, it was reintroduced [in the house](https://ipolitics.ca/2020/12/03/proposed-bill-would-bring-canadian-law-in-line-with-undrip/) by the justice minister. i am not sure how the new bill compares to the one tabled by the ndp previously. 

~~to date, as far as i know, it has not even been debated in parliament or passed the first reading.~~ currently the bill is at second reading in the house. i suspect it is unlikely to go through the house and senate before trudeau calls the election. i would assume he will promise, yet again for the 3rd time, to implement it if elected.

edit: another user has pointed out it is at second reading actually. my mistake.",liberals

they just never caught the incidents in the us, and never asked previous work places.

cra and one other agency never did the background checks, but pco even now says they were thorough.

trudeau never spoke with garneau. of course, that is not a huge thing as it probably wouldn't have come up.

trudeau made an error by listening to the pmo.

seeing the ipolitics article and looking at the g&amp;m one, it can be very easy to know from piecing today's article with that that definitely vetting to the standard done with that committee was never truly done. yes, pco and trudeau says it was proper, but not on a high enough level, for a gg.

trudeau's answers today confirm what the pco and other agencies said back in 2017-18 that all procedures were followed and it was thorough.

so therefore what trudeau said today was carefully crafted knowing this information was going to come out, but again the government is committed to reforming the vetting process. i doubt it was intentional.

i still don't believe there is enough out there to cause a scandal because she is gone and they conducted that investigation, and the government is committed to bringing in a gg in a better process and making sure it is a person of high standards.",liberals

i will start by saying that i probably qualify as a \"tough on crime\" person.   i strongly disagree with the belief that the justice system should only be concerned with rehabilitation.  that is essential, but i firmly believe that punishment is an essential component of justice.   

the fact remains however that when we put someone in prison we make ourselves responsible for the health, safety and security far more than we are for people who we do not put in prison precisely because putting them in prison takes away much of their ability to look after that for themselves.   we can (and should) put them in prison for committing crimes and when we do we inescapably take on greater responsibility for their well being.

that means they should be given vaccines exactly the same way that canadians are and right now we're doing that on the basis of risk and exposure.   and since prisons are confined places where the prisoners can't just leave, that means living in a prison puts you at greater risk than a great many canadians.   

now we don't have to distribute vaccines on the basis of risk.  we could do it on first come, first serve.   we could do it by random lottery.   we could do it by who can pay the most for a dose.   we have all sorts of choices.   we seem to have chosen risk and exposure as our criteria. 

and that puts some criminals ahead of me.   i'm not thrilled by that.    [the guy who committed these horrendous rapes and murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wells_gray_provincial_park_murders) will almost certainly get the vaccine ahead of me.  he should have been executed years ago.   he shouldn't be alive.  read the wikipedia secton on his capture to make it very, very obvious why that man should have been executed and why it's a grave injustice that he was not and the friends and families of his victims still have to regularly convince the parole board not to let him out of prison.  (edit: he's coming up for parole again soon if anyone wants to pm me about when so you can sign a petition against it.)    but that's not relevant.   we pick a method, (risk and exposure), and follow that to it's conclusion.

this can obviously set a precedent that many conservatives of different persuasions may not like. 

certainly some would say that it sets a precedent for the federal government to try to intervene in quebec's bill 21, the prohibition on public sector workers wearing religious symbols. that is after all a violation of their freedom of religion. bill 21 directly invoked the notwithstanding clause to prevent it being overturned on this basis.

others would argue that the collective economic and environmental damage of climate change  would  justify any federal intervention in areas provincial authority to decrease carbon emissions.

what i'm trying to say here is that we should be careful when we call for the federal government to exceed it's due constitutional authority. it sets a bad precedent. conservatives traditionally stand for greater provincial autonomy. challenging the public health restrictions imposed by the provinces is likely a matter best left to the courts.

yes, that's true, but i would strongly argue this is just as true of mr. sloan just as it was true of mr. bernier.   (the [federal election results for the ppc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/people%27s_party_of_canada#federal_elections) were abysmal.)

mr. sloan likely thinks he can take a subset of the party with him.  i think he's wrong for a few reasons.

1. more popular men than him have tried and failed.  in the 2017 leadership race, mr. bernier got 29% of the vote, the most of any candidate.   he was still leading in the penultimate round only eventually losing with 49% of the vote.   compare that with derek sloan's leadership race which in retrospect, never had a chance.   given how badly mr. bernier failed in his attempt, there's not a chance that the incredibly less popular derek sloan will succeed.
2. conservatives know very well that a split conservative party guarantees permanent lpc majority government.  they haven't forgotten their time in the wilderness.
3. social conservatives can see that derek sloan's complaint that the conservative party has become hostile to social conservatives is demonstrably false given the star candidacy of leslyn lewis who trounced derek sloan in the leadership race despite not even having been elected as an mp.   

no one is following derek sloan out the door.   he's no more a risk to the conservative party than the communist party of canada is a threat to the ndp.",conservatives

i watched his vid on facebook, and he actually did make some pretty reasonable points. it is true that we delayed closing our borders. i was saying back in january we should do this, and i'm just an armchair health expert. and he's exactly right that anyone who talked about border closures back then was called racist. i know if anyone suggested that on this sub back then, they got down voted to oblivion. yes, it's true that we needed to be careful about chinese canadians experiencing racism, but we went overboard and conflated that with any discussions around border closures. we need to start looking more for nuance, rather than just baseline knee jerk emotional responses.

it was clearly our government's choice to delay action, following tam's advice, who followed who. people say nobody knew enough about it back then, but that's simply not true. we could have followed the example of countries like s korea, who recently had experience with mers. they were already in strict lock down and employing rapid testing at the time.

the key question then is why do politicians espouse these contra-factual policy positions? it would seem that politicians, at least on the conservative/republican side, **believe what they're paid to believe**, *i.e.* their financial backers are giving them money in order to have them espouse these contra-factual policies. and in turn, you probably have politicians changing their positions in order to maximize financial return. 

if that's the case, then our priority for reforming the system should be to eliminate private money from politics, whether that be through public financing, or a combination of public financing with a very low cap on individual donations and a ban on corporate donations. 

the current maximum that an individual in canada can donate in support of political causes is quite out of reach of ordinary canadians:

polls are done online within the echo chamber of the pollsters' members. it is not a representative sample of canadians at all. these are people who purposely fill in surveys online in order to get reward points, and then get gift cards. pollsters who do this for example include [angus-reid](https://www.angusreidforum.com/en-ca/sign-in?returnurl=%2fen-ca%2f),  [leger](https://www.legeropinion.com/en/?affcode=gn34yy6&amp;utm_source=site-web-leger360&amp;utm_medium=pageleo&amp;utm_campaign=sitewebleger360) and [ipsos](https://social.i-say.com/), among many others.

there is a specific demographic this type of polling targets, and its not the \"average\" canadian. bored housewives, low income, the unemployed, etc. dual income families who are typically too busy at work, raising kids, etc. and don't have the time to sign up to fill in surveys to make a quick few cents. there is no random phone call. 

could you make it look like a representative sample of people are polled?(different regions, ages etc.)  most certainly, but the reality is, they are not. it is the same sub-group echo chamber. if you never sign up, there is a zero chance you will ever get asked.

these polls get the same results because they ask the same people. you can create a poll, email it out, and have results in a day for a couple hundred dollars.

in addition, they do not have a margin of error instead say something like:
&gt;for comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would
carry a margin of error of +/- 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

in other words, *if* this was a real sample of random people, *then* that is what the margin of error would be.",conservatives

&gt;for example, as noted in our new fraser institute study, the chrétien government famously balanced the federal budget in 1997-98, largely due to spending cuts that saw federal spending (excluding interest costs) reduced by 9.7 per cent over two years. (if you adjust for inflation and population, the chrétien government actually reduced per-person federal spending by 16.5 per cent.)

aren't those cuts that chretien made now generally considered, by actual credible economists and not the fraser institute, to have been a bad idea? how is austerity right now a good idea? i think even the bank of canada and most economists right now agree it isn't.

gas is on the way out. electricity will become likely the dominant choice of consumers by the end of 15 years. density at the will only increase by 25% (using past growth rates) which would mean that we still won't have anything near even the population even acela has and still well below that of the french tgv currently.

&gt;we can and should be improving municipal transit as well. one of the reasons the european system works so well is it is a fully integrated system.

i don't disagree. i would love it. that being said, i cannot justify the $20b to build a line which would shave 1 hour off of what we currently have if it were just optimized. an express mtl-to train can make it 3 hours right now if it could maintain the 160kmh they're designed to. having the equivalent of a tgv here would make it 1h50mins. sure its nice, but is it really a priority if we have finite funds? sure we could do some deficit spending, but deficit spending for marginal gains for a project which we can't prove will have massive widespread adoption is not sound fiscal policy. that $20b can solve much more pressing issues.

my argument is that frequency is key, so electrification is a more reasonable proposition. even then, it wouldn't be worth it until we could prove demand. if it were my call, i'd let cp and cn keep their track, but pay to electrify it but give via priority and let them (for a fee) run electric freight trains on that route. that would give the required usage to justify that cost as municipalities that also run on this track would also be electrified, saving money for freight, commuter and intercity companies. bonus, it reduces cost for hsr should we get there.",liberals

&gt; a step forward yesterday, and a giant leap backward today. if canadian conservatives can’t defenestrate this merry band they’re not going far. 

if you replace \"defenestrate\" with \"commit arson against\" (which i think is a fair substitution in light of the point you're trying to make) it absolutely comes across as a call to violence. what prevents me from seeing butts' comments that way is (a) the absurdity of \"defenestration\" as a word and concept in modern times, (b) the fact that his comment is directed at people unlikely to heed any call to violence from him, and (c) the phrasing actually *does* make it clear he's using the metaphorical meaning 

don't get me wrong, i think both gerry and andy come across badly here. gerry for not realizing using language rooted in the violent overthrow of political leaders would get this reaction this week. andy for trying to sell it as something that might actually cause violence.

gj31ww2,2021-01-12T13:21:38.000-08:00,"brantford police investigate billboard depicting justin trudeau beside image of hitler &gt;\"freedom of speech\" is an american term. in canada, section 2 of the charter protects \"freedom of expression\"

aside from the fact that speech is a form of expression and courts frequently use \"freedom of speech\" and \"freedom of expression\", the canadian bill of rights 1960 protects \"freedom of speech\" - so no, it's not \"an american term\", it's a right protected by *canadian* law.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;whether or not comparing trudeau to hitler would be considered defamation

it is not defamatory libel. that is, quite frankly, a ridiculous suggestion. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;or hate speech is unclear,

no, it's not unclear, because it's speech targeting a specific individual, not a group. it is impossible to commit an offence under s. 318 or 319 of the criminal code by way of speech targeting a lone person.",liberals
