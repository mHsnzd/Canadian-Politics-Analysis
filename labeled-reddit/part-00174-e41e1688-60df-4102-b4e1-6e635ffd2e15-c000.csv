i'll also point out that early in harper's tenure we had the global financial crisis, so most of the rest of his time in power was a guided descent back to balance from a burst of keynesian stimulus. it was along the lines of what mulroney had been doing.

where as no significant shocks of that nature hit canada as hard during chretien/martin. and they had also just succeeded the mulroney government which had been reining in public spending for most of the decade prior and had installed the gst. and speaking of the gst harper did it all with a 5% gst not a 7% gst.

edit: let's also give the liberals the credit where it was due, the balanced budget was martin's doing, not chretien. he actually wanted to go back on what mulroney had accomplished. but the ratings agencies and the success of klein's cuts in alberta gave martin the political cover and impetus to do what he did. in spite of his boss.",liberals

but it faced a divided right and no real threat at the polls. so chretien saw no reason to spend money when he could horde it and use it in the event he needed it. he didn't restore the spending he'd taken. which left martin looking for what to do with the money. thankfully, he just paid off the debt.

the thought was that when the right united the liberals would be able to offer a huge raft of new social spending to entice voters. then martin basically forced chretien to leave, but before he left chretien stabbed martin and the party in the back by bringing in a host of new programs which ate up the surplus and would leave martin little room to offer up grandiose new programs against a united right. he even changed the rules about political donations, banning big donations and corporate donations - the mainstay of the liberal party.

why do these corpses deserve greater compassion and self-determination than a live woman?   


also, the doomsday deadline doesn't keep getting pushed farther back, we keep \\*reaching them\\*. sure there's some back and forth about the exact dates, because the climate is an incredibly complex system and different models are going to arrive at slightly different dates. but that's not the effect you're describing. politicians keep dragging their heels on climate change, so carbon keeps getting pumped into the air and the amount of warming goes up. at first we wanted to stop it completely, and when that became impossible we tried to limit it to one degree, 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees...  


the more apathetic the general population is about this matter, the less will be done and the worse the effects will be. there is \\*literally\\* no way that the warming we are seeing now is natural to any great extent, and describing our actions as \"natural\" is a bs distraction at best. we are thinking beings, able to make conscious decisions, and unfortunately we have reached the point where our actions affect the entire global ecosystem. doing nothing because it's \"nature\" is unacceptable when that course will lead to human suffering and death on an incredible scale, not to mention the devastation of the rest of the biosphere.",conservatives

hq3ppjg,2021-12-26T11:13:18.000-08:00,"canada‚Äôs immigration boost could fuel hot housing market: experts &gt;in the 1931 census,  
&gt;  
&gt;  (pg 214)roughly eight million of canada's population of ten million were born here.

so 20 percent of the population was not born here. which is pretty close to the average through our history, and pretty close to what it is now. 

british 'possessions' is meaningless.  those are their own cultures and language, britian just controls them. would you say that \"india\" which was a british possession is the same as england? no?  hmmmm. 

btw - at the time newfoundland wasn't officially part of canada and is listed as an  'immigrant' nation that's part of britian's  'possessions'. i think we can both agree that' not really an 'immigrant nation'. 

so - just over half of the immigrants in canada were not from britain or it's isles. 

thank you for proving my point. 

&gt;there is no evidence our immigration system over the past fifty years has been a success. 

there is in fact. but i think we have to face the fact that you're not coming at this from a point of view of honest research, but rather confirmation bias. or you wouldn't have made that mistake on the census i just pointed out. 

i suppose you could move the goalposts around to try to redefine 'success' till you found something to your liking but that'd be cheezy. 

&gt;because the canadian government does not set out any goals for our immigration system to accomplish. 

they have frequently. here's just one:

https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/research/documents/pdf/r33-2013-econ-social.pdf

it was a re-examination of the goals that lead to the changes of 2006, and the goals were frequently re-evaluated. i haven't seen a similar doc since trudeau got in but i haven't really looked either. 

so what you've stated is incorrect. 

&gt;the government has done no studies of the immigration system which would suggest its purpose or goals or how best to accomplish that purpose or goals.

they have done many. i suspect you havent' looked, they're very easy to find for those who actually care about the subject. there are ones that focus on pre-06 and post-06. i don't feel like wasting time looking up anything else to prove you're wrong, you can do that yourself this time instead of seeking to prove your confirmation bias, 

sorry - as i have shown you're badly misinformed on this. to the point of delusion. 

no, the \"majority' of immigrants in the past weren't from england. 

yes, we have traditionally had a plan for immigration and a reason. even more so in current times. 

yes, since 2006 immigrants have a small benefit to the economy, and sorry but the data actually does point to a benefit with the aging population. it's not huge, but it's there.  their children however have a much larger benefit to us. 

keep reading. and if i could offer some advice, it's never a bad practice to try to prove yourself wrong by taking up the counter- argument and trying to prove that.if you can't succeed then you probably have a more solid base.",liberals

he can't possibly be criticised on the thought behind the work, because he can't make it public. since he's presented this as an argument from authority, he's left the ndp with no way of defending themselves besides attacking his authority.

&gt; his third agenda item is the proposal to force social media giants ‚Äî facebook and google ‚Äî to share ad revenues with news publishers from content posted on their sites.

this seems completely backwards. so if i, a user, post a link to (say) a toronto star article on facebook, to promote it to my network of friends ... facebook should *pay them a fee for being advertised*? 

if i post a link to a *star* article, and some of my friends like it and enjoy the quality journalism, they're more likely to buy a subscription in the future. that act *promotes* the star as a media source, it's the opposite of an injustice done to the star. the likely result of forcing facebook to pay a fee every time a canadian newspaper article is posted, is for fb to ban links to canadian news in order to avoid the fee. thus the star ends up getting even *less* exposure.

yes, facebook and google have replaced newspapers and television as the most cost-efficient way to market to a particular group of people, because they have been able to gather large amounts of data not available to media organizations. which is why the ad dollars have went there. no, it's not because they're stealing content or anything like that.

if the death of journalism is a major concern, surely the right approach is to tax the tech giants more and use it to subsidize the media. this weird \"the more often your media organization gets exposure from people, the more a 3rd party has to pay them\" has all the wrong incentives, and it's about as good a policy design as o'toole's carbon savings account.",conservatives

it used to be that conservative platforms offered an assortment of decent, and often novel, policy ideas. the tfsa? great idea. thanks jim. carbon credits? not how i'd do it, but a workable idea if implemented correctly, and evidence of a novel, good-faith effort to pro-actively tackle a major issue.

today? following your example of saying something nice, i tried to recall something from the 2021 cpc platform that i found inspiring. ideally something bit bigger than some sticker that i'm going to read once, after i've already decided where to refuel my car, and never notice again.

i didn't have much luck, so i dug up their platform document. lots of the *aims* listed are well and good, but the details are either sparse, or missing entirely. in all fairness, that applies to all party platforms, but two things really stuck out... 

first was the overwhelming emphasis on small-government, public-private partnerships, and tax rebates as the path to prosperity, as if we don't have 40+ years of evidence that the tired neoliberal playbook isn't some guaranteed, automatic path to universal prosperity. as a well-educated, gainfully employed 30-something small business owner, i'll tell you for free that there's a hell of a lot more than a couple grand worth of tax rebates standing between me and home-ownership, or me and starting a family.  

second thing i noticed was that the section on climate policy repeatedly emphasized that while a conservative government wouldn't stand in the way of the development of clean energy projects, they also absolutely would not, under any circumstances, jeopardize jobs in canada's oil and gas sector. hell, *two* of the five points in their \"national clean energy strategy\" strategy section involved *increasing* government support for lng! they couldn't have done more to suggest that they either don't understand the problems caused by greenhouse gas emission, or just don't care, if they'd have just came out and said it.

this just isn't a party with any fresh ideas, or any capacity to make a good case for conservatism offering a superior solutions any to our current problems.",conservatives

in canadian foreign policy there's a tendency to focus on our relationship with china. i think it's actually more important to focus on our relationship with japan, for geographic reasons: basically, japan is closer. having a friendly japan and a hostile china is preferable to having a hostile japan and a friendly china.",liberals

objectivism is made up of three parts according to the wikipedia article. one of it being ***\"individual rights and capitalism\"***

libertarians and classical liberals supported these ideas as part of their ideology wayyy before rand even existed. ludwig von mises for example was arguing for free-market capitalism wayyy before rand existed.

the rest of your comments mid section is some delusional reasoning about national policy economic program not being a progressive spending plan. this argument might have worked, if the liberals didn't oppose his program lol. when william louis and mackenzie king and came into power they slowly dismantled the national policy. so the liberals were the small-government party, that also loved free trade.

&gt;***\"well you are describing exactly what neo liberal conservatism is, that i mentioned yesterday.\"***

only to a moron who doesn't understand what he's talking about and thinks that entire political ideologies can be described in a single sentence. seriously - fuck no.

i don't know what your comment has to do with the comment you quoted of mine(in bold). but everyone knows that, if you cant describe an ideology simply given the context. then you don't have an understanding of that political ideology or concept.

&gt;it would be pointless to explain to you. explaining would require more than three sentances and apperently your brain can't cope with the idea that any political party or ideology might be more complicated than that.  
&gt;  
&gt;sorry kid but you're just not at a level where we can discuss this stuff in any detail.  
&gt;  
&gt;here's some advice -first off, stop thinking of ideologies as absolute 'cast in stone' things that are the same for all people. they're more of a spectrum.  
&gt;  
&gt;and stop trying to define them in simple policy terms. that's not how they work. you can't say \"oh, these three policies are also policies that this party likes so this person must be of that party\". it's way more nuanced than that. just like anglicans are not catholics but they both believe in god.
