gmh5czi,2021-02-07T01:21:21.000-08:00,"opinion: the sunk costs fallacy is killing us in the struggle to contain covid-19 i always enjoy reading pieces on politics written by people coming from a non-politics perspective, in this case a doctor's perspective. it breaks up the myopia one can develop when listening to nothing but wonks and pundits.

with that being said, i feel the author has missed the mark on her diagnosis of the issue. 

&gt;...the sunk cost is the too-late, too-light, half-baked lockdowns that have allowed covid-19 to spread beyond the point of control in most of our provinces, with the notable exceptions of nova scotia and pei. the rest of our lockdowns have generally been associated with high loss of life because of our premiers’ attachments to their original choices, including slow closings, premature openings and delayed reactions to rising case counts. and because they had invested so much of their political and leadership capital in those decisions, they struggled to separate the cost of correcting those errors with what they had already lost.

drawing from her experience as a doctor (as she explicitly does in the article) this isn't an unreasonable conclusion. a doctor who insists on continuing a treatment plan that isn't working/despite better options being available likely is doing so out of ego or the sunk cost fallacy. rarely is it that the doctor in question simply believes the better option shouldn't be used or that doctors shouldn't be the one's to do it. you don't get many doctors refusing to use radiation therapy for cancer patients, if all signs indicate that would be the best course of action, because \"well doctors shouldn't be irradiating people so let's do something less effective and hope for the best.\"

however this dynamic is exactly what has fumbled our covid response and the response of other jurisdictions. effective measures are being un/underused because many governments are run by those who, on an ideological level, don't believe the government should *do things*. looking at you ford/kenney.

the aggressive lockdown measures required to stamp out cases? \"can't do it, it'll kill the economy.\"

okay, then aggressive lockdown while providing sufficient financial support for affected businesses? \"can't. costs too much. we'll just do a half-assed lockdown.\"

alright well can we at least get paid sick days so people aren't spreading covid at work because they have to decide between staying home when sick or making rent? \"not the place of the government to impose.\" 

it is the penny wise, pound foolish, brand of 'fiscal responsibility' embraced by modern conservatives (or at the very least embraced by modern conservative governments) that has been the main impediment to getting the pandemic under control. not just here but globally.",conservatives

hcrphbb,2021-09-13T12:02:26.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - monday, september 13, 2021 it speaks to the untenability of the \"base\" conservative perspective in a canadian context. all of our parties are big tents, but the size of the conservative big tent is truly awesome. i was actually thinking a couple of months ago about the following. on the topic of poverty, consider the following three positions:

1. people in poverty deserve to be helped out of their position, and the best way to help them is through public programmes funded through taxes.
2. people in poverty deserve to be helped out of their position, and the best way to help them is through private charities and personal donations.
3. people in poverty do not deserve help. poverty is a result of their own moral failings, and it is morally and ethically right that they stay poor.

superficially, 1 and 2 seem pretty similar while 3 seems completely different. but we consider 1 to be a progressive position while we consider *both* 2 *and* 3 to be different flavours of conservative. speaking personally, if i believed in number 2 (and i don't), i'd be horrified to be sharing a tent with number 3, but political expediency declares it so.

harper managed to hold these disparate forces together, but it was a miracle that he could. take abortion: harper's position was essentially \"i will do nothing to change the status quo on abortion, but i will not say anything *bad* about pro-lifers\". how that was enough for pro-life activists to continue to fund and support the cpc, i have no idea. but a party that actually tosses pro-lifers a policy bone is a party that cannot get elected in canada.

i believe that o'toole actually is a moderate. but i also believe that that doesn't matter because (a) his currently espoused positions are clearly focus-group feedback as opposed to convictions, and (b) his *party* is much less moderate than he is, and he doesn't have the strength of personality that harper had to quell those forces.

he's done well so far, but if he loses, the post-mortem will be ugly. and the *next* cpc leader and the one after that will continue to face an increasingly giant gulf between what the base wants and what they need to do to get elected.",conservatives

hcrrf0u,2021-09-13T12:17:21.000-07:00,"o'toole makes pitch to women voters, vows to hike benefits for grieving parents i've read all the points you have made, and i can't help but think how short sighted you are? are you planning on becoming elderly, or will you die before you retire. cause if you want to be elderly, you will be a burden on society that the youth will have to accommodate, in healthcare burdens and taxes amongst other things.

the difference in childcare and eldercare though, is that eldercare never pays itself off, childcare does. people have provided the numbers (which you never disputed), childcare leads to more productive mothers, high quality care can have some improvements on the development and socialization of children, it is tax negative if mothers can find employment, etc.

economists submitted a report to the commons on the effects of quebec's childcare which i will link: https://www.ourcommons.ca/content/committee/421/fewo/brief/br8806290/br-external/fortinpierre-e.pdf 

if you choose not to read it, i will include some quotes from the text:

\"(the chart) underlines two developments. the first is that from 1998 to 2014 the participation rate differential between mothers of young children and other women 20-44 was reduced in all parts of the country, but by twice as much in quebec (8 percentage points) as elsewhere (4 points).\"

\"the second development is that the labour market behaviour of young women in quebec underwent radical change between 1998 and 2014. on one hand, while the labour force participation rate of mothers of young children rose by a modest 4 points outside of quebec, it increased by a whopping 13 points in quebec. on the other hand, while, outside of quebec, the participation rate of women who were not mothers of 0-to-5 year olds remained unchanged in 2014 from 1998, it increased by 5 points in quebec. this raises the possibility that the quebec program has had a long-term impact: using childcare while working before kindergarten begins may have increased the chances of being at work later, after the child has entered school.\"

\"summarizes overall trends in labour force participation of canadian women of  
childbearing age. over the 19-year span 1997-2016, the rate for quebec women rose from 2 points below to 5 points above that for women in other parts of canada.\"

\"furthermore, uqam researchers found that the effect was indeed long-term, as  
suggested by the picture in chart 8 above. if a mother uses childcare while working before her child begins school, then she is more likely to be at work later, once the child has entered school. this is particularly so for middle- to low-income mothers\"

\"based on all these results, university of sherbrooke colleagues and i estimated that in 2008 there were 70,000, or 3.8 per cent, more quebec mothers in employment than there would have been without the reform, and that the **long-term impact on provincial gross domestic income (gdp) was an increase of around 5 billion dollars, or 1.7 per cent (fortin et al. 2013). these are very**  
**large effects**\"

\"modest, but significant, contribution to the **60 per cent decline** in the number of single-parent families who received social assistance benefits in quebec after 1997\"

so the economy grows and you pay less taxes for other peoples social security huh.",conservatives

in china, they have the strictest gun laws in the world... basically nobody can own a gun. still, there crazy people use knifes and hammers to commit mass murder. unfortunately a common target is to randomly kill young children.

we don't hear about this in the west but it's important to at least look at what the world might be like if all guns were banned by looking at a place where they are.

gun bans also don't prevent crazy people from renting vans. vans have enable mass murder in canada and the uk. so do we outlaw vehicles?

while we had a gun registry, gun violence didn't go down. in my own town, murders went way up. none of the guns used were registered. in ontario, now untraceable home made guns have become a problem.

i grew up in a town where i rode my bike down to watch skeet shooting. thought nothing of it. it was a safe place. no crazies.

long and short of it is, banning guns will be ineffective. bad or crazy people will always have a way to do harm.

a better question is how can spot and deal with crazy or bad people; ideally when they are still young and respond to intervention but at minimum when they get in trouble with the law. ironically, it's the liberals that have often be soft on criminals.",liberals

the ace in harper's pocket was his gradual journey from opposition leader to minority pm to majority pm. every step of the way, people could be frightened away by stories of harper's 'hidden agenda'. but by 2011, he had developed enough of a record of relatively moderate governance that he could say, 'what hidden agenda?' and get the 905 to believe him.

untrue. conservatives typically seek to maintain some specific aspect of a social order, but are often also interested in altering a different aspect of it if they think it will result in a more stable or powerful society.

the childcare issue is really regional, impacting urban, suburban and rural differently depending where you live.  so essentially i think its the provinces and municipalities that should be dealing with childcare space issues that are specific to where the problems are, and the federal government just be helping out with funding - and giving funding to families directly makes the most sense to me as it allows for more choice.

i get that the daycare institutions are really pushing for $10/day solution because it benefits their business plan, but it simply doesn't benefit all canadians families equally and equitably.  if what happened in quebec happens across canada it will push home daycares out of business, which again only serves the institutional care.   are your kids better off at home with you, with a relative, with a home daycare with 4-5 other kids, or an institution with 20+ kids?  personally i think i just listed what's best for kids in order.   the $10/day plans has been shown to push kids to the last option.",conservatives

with those improvements to the grid, mandate that new homes must be electrically heated. 30+% of canada's emissions come from heating, which is why canada is in the top 20 for per capita emissions. implement aggressive incentives to retrofit existing homes with electric heaters.

next, habitat level conservation. any construction in a wetland is banned. they're super valuable carbon sinks. also, massively scale back cattle grazing in the prairies. expropriate the land if necessary and convert that back to grassland. same reasoning.

next, agriculture. it also makes up a significant chunk of emissions. remember the biofuel from earlier? once that's set in place, manufacture of agricultural diesel is banned. use the biofuel instead. it's literally exactly the same except its made from algae. place a hard cap on the amount of fertilizer a farmer is allowed to use. same with pesticides. use tax breaks to encourage mixed permaculture over cash crop agriculture, ideally eliminating the need for fertilizer and pesticides altogether. it'll take some retooling, but that's what ecologists are for.

h96xi9p,2021-08-16T04:58:35.000-07:00,"2021 conservative party platform: \"canada's recovery plan\" yes and no. if i'm reading correctly, the key is that it's not really an incentive, it's a requirement to set aside some money. if you buy 1 tonnesworth of gas, you are required to contribute $20 (up to 50 in the future) into your savings account. it's not a free $20, it's your $20, and you aren't allowed to spend it on things that aren't clean. essentially, it is a carbon tax, but rather than the tax revenue going to the government it goes into a savings account which can only be spent on certain things. in theory, this would reduce the government incentive to adjust tax levels based on desired revenue and force them to focus on appropriately discouraging emissions. note that from what i understand, the consensus is that an ideal price would be at least 100usd/tn.

of course, tax incidence might dick around with this a bit. when you add a consumer-payable tax like this, suppliers will lower their price somewhat to keep consumers interested. so let's say my flight from toronto to vancouver produces one quarter-tonne of co2. that means when i buy it, there's an extra $5-$12.50 (say $10) tax attached to the ticket, but to keep my interest, the airline knocks off like $2. if flights are price elastic (demand is very responsive to changes in price) they will knock off almost the whole amount of the tax, if they're price-inelastic, they would knock off not very much.

for most people, that's going to discourage them from flying, at least a little bit. however, i personally spend a lot of money on transit passes and not very much on gas. so for me, flying actually becomes cheaper, since i get the $2 off, and i just have to spend $10 on something i would spend it on anyway.

it works as long as you assume that people's green spending would normally be less than what accumulates in their green savings account. if someone would normally be a big green spender, they would be encouraged to buy price elastic goods that produce emissions.

fortunately for this plan (but unfortunately for the world), conventional wisdom is that gasoline is typically fairly price inelastic.

note - the sticker price of this tax isn't true! if you're forced to save $50/tn, that's not a $50/tn tax. it's $50 minus the value (to you) of whatever you spend it on. so if every time you emit a tonne you have to buy a $50 bicycle that you only value at $40, that's a $10/tn tax, not $50/tn. you can't put a price on carbon to disincentivize its use without making people worse off, making people worse off *is the whole point*. people have to stop trying to find loopholes in here.",conservatives

before you say that the pandemic has caused increased spending because it was an emergency, none of the big three parties have suggested they plan to turn off the money printer any time soon. the conservatives have said they want to balance the budget within a decade. aside from a ten-year plan being stupid in a political system with an election every two-four years, this also might as well just say, \"we aren't going to balance the budget.\"

honestly, i think the most likely way it gets scrapped is that, during one of the required every-five-years renewals of the use of the notwithstanding clause, a party like the quebec liberals is in power which does not want to invoke that clause, rendering the bill vulnerable to being struck down by the courts as a violation of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms. and then they might say quebec has argued about the issue for too many years and they want to focus on other topics.

the second most likely way it would get scrapped is if one of the currently ongoing court cases finds that it violates some part of the canadian constitution which is not subject to the notwithstanding clause, of which there are several potentially relevant examples (see the court cases for details). as in the above scenario, i think neither the caq nor the plq would want to expend much more political capital on relegislating this issue now that they both fulfilled their campaign promises and passed legislation, following more than a decade of quebec focusing political energy on this issue.",liberals

imagine you have a small forest fire (covid).  at first, you have no idea it exists so you do nothing about it.  over time, the fire spreads and grows.  you finally detect the fire and decide to do something about it.

now then, you could attack the fire directly (a lockdown), however, it's impossible to contain the entire thing immediately as it's too large, however, over time, you can get around it and get it under control.  the problem is though, that sparks fly off the fire (contact tracers being lied to) and the fire spreads beyond the borders that were created to contain it (contact tracing).  yes, that will help solve the problem, but only when the fire is small.

but!  while getting that fire under control more fires start (trudeau's piss-poor international border control).  unfortunately, more fires pop up, seemingly out of nowhere and begin the same spread as the original fire.  so, now, you have to stomp out all the new fires as well.  these new fires continue to be started on a daily basis, in random locations.  it cannot be ascertained that they actually started until it's too late.

but!  it gets worse than that.  the new fires that were being randomly created now throw off 10x the number of sparks the original fire tossed out.  (variants).  they are able to pass through the fire control (lockdowns/masking) and spread the fire 10x more rapidly than before.  

so, at that point what exactly can you do?  you lockdown the province for 4 weeks and slow the spread, meanwhile new cases are coming in internationally on a daily basis, starting new covid infection chains.  so, essentially after that 4 week lockdown, the entire process begins anew, over and over again.

what i'm saying here is that a 4 week lockdown (including shutting down all essential services except grocery) would have helped, however, due to international travel continuing (with little to no control over it), new cases come in, they spread and the process renews it's self.  essentially, while the borders are open, the only choice would be to keep the lockdown running, 100% of the time...until the pandemic comes to an end, or, for about 1.5 years.

do not discount the problems the federal governments have caused by not implementing strict border controls.  even now, they completely and utterly suck.",liberals

gvcaal3,2021-04-21T02:39:42.000-07:00,"opinion: the conservatives’ carbon pricing plan: a tax that wouldn’t even reduce carbon consumption to play devils advocate. in my province gas just went up 20 cents due to a provincial carbon tax mixed with the federal one. i try to like as renewable heavy as i can, and i was saving up for an electric vehicle slowly as i am a full time student and worker and drive about 50km a day. most of my wage goes to tuition and rent, the rest to food and utilities, and then the tiny bit i have left is for my savings to buy an electric vehicle. now however, due to the higher gas prices my savings have been eaten into every week for gas due to the increased price. so quite literally, the carbon tax is making it impossible for me to become more green.

many young people cannot afford a vehicle over $5-7k, many are renting and cannot install or afford solar panels, not everyone can take a bus. many rely on their old beaters of vehicles to get places to simply survive, to work, to learn, and to come home. with gas prices so high it just eats more and more into the smaller incomes of many young people, making it even more difficult to turn to renewables. 

i think the carbon tax should be scrapped completely for the average person, that big corporations/businesses should have to pay them at a higher percentage, nuclear energy should be at the forefront of the fight against climate change, and even cut taxes significantly for several years for companies who decide to build nuclear or green/renewable power plants. take the tax money from the corporate carbon tax and invest it into making electric vehicles cheaper for the average person. 

heck, i would be fine with the carbon tax if the money was invested into grants for people who want to buy electric vehicles but cannot afford them. 

tl;dr if i only make enough money to put myself through school and survive, the carbon tax hurts me alot and makes it even more difficult for me and many young people to switch to renewables.",conservatives

when election season actually comes, it then becomes the burden of the ndp to convince the voters who are sick of ford that they're the right choice to replace him. one election where they came second isn't going to change the nature of ontario politics to the point that the ndp will get the protest vote by default, it would overly optimistic to think so.",liberals

now one can argue that the lpc is a lot more pro-choice than the cpc, and that is a decent argument if there are good numbers to back it (which i believe there are), but saying the personal positions of the leader matter utmost would be wrong as shown here.

awesome yeah sure:

murder is wrong and should be prevented and punished by law.
the right to live and not be killed by others is extended to all humans no matter their age, race, social class, health, sex, dependence on others, physical or mental ability, value to society, value to the economy, or if they are loved or unloved. no one has the right to redefine a person as a killable thing with no rights, based on their physical characteristics. no physical characteristic makes a person not a person.

that's pretty good i think. just from my head like this. i don't mention the kid specifically because that is really what we are going for. we think killing a baby a day before birth and killing a baby a day after birth is not different for anything that is actually relative to a person's rights like their ability or age or something. same with 8.5 months before or after. nothing changes that is actually relevant to rights. that is the point we are trying to get to in society and what we are trying to convince you to do to. the rest of the discussion arises because the pro-abortion sides arguments to deny the right that is by default given. the pro abortion version of that paragraph has a bunch of asterisks after each line. so then depending on whatever of those reasons you believe in i would continue why i reject that reason. 

and regarding the term pro abortionist. like what more do you want from me? you are supporting an argument that advocates that babies can be killed, against a person advocating we should save the baby. i think that position is sociopathicly devoid of compassion, all the weak reasons come down to selfishness, cowardic, or apathy, and it's as comparable a moral horror as every other genocide currently happening. what do you want me to call you? \"pro abortionist\" is the least inflammatory term i could use. how about pro-death, pro-murder, or anti-right to life? i could honestly with no exaggerating approximate the abortion movement in those terms. i don't know how i can coddle my opponents any further than call them pro abortionist. its pretty tame and matter of fact. i know you guys don't want every baby aborted or something. a person would be stupid to think pro-abortion meant every baby. you are the ones defending the current practice of abortion. so i think that's reasonable. i am fine being called anti abortion, even though i think the case of life of the mother is acceptable. pro life is acturate as well since we talk about right to life so much. i'm not going to use pro choice because it's a weak distraction argument to which no one is arguing against, which doesn't even address the pro life points, is irrelevant if indeed the baby has rights, and so is useless to contribute to the argument and is only good as an echo chamber point among themselves. 

then i have heard this before... people say it's horrible but it's necessary... like do you guys not  know how many abortions there are?? we have about 100000 a year! that is not all ectopic pregnancies. what abortion is is for any reason and then with a little tiny bit of life-of-the-mother on the side. people have this naive idea that people only get abortions when they've tried all we can and with a heavy heart surrender to inevitable fate. that is not what it is. we have non hospital clinics for your convenience! its so frustrating to keep hearing people think that because if thats is what you think it should be, then that is exactly what we are trying to do and you should be on our side until we get it down to health/life of the mother and then if people want to take it further bail then. people today primarily kill their own children because they don't want to raise a kid. \"kill it because it will be in a poor family\" is psycho to me. \"kill them because the baby is sick\" is psycho and the nazis would love that argument. \"kill it because we didn't use protection or it failed\" is horrifyingly irresponsible.
kill one life of a baby that will die so that the mother does not die too is a tragedy but is a sane argument that does the least harm. the state of our abortion law is terrible. we need to limit it to life of the mother. if we did, abortion would drop massively. probably more than 90%.

this is really long but yeah like, see i haven't needed to use religion yet. i can use the general human rights language that we all claim to believe in.",conservatives

i'm a liberal voter previously and for the near future, there's little doubt about that, but this internet regulation stuff is where myself and the lpc don't see eye to eye. 

i strongly believe that even if many major countries all enact similar legislation to regulate the internet in different ways, whether it means censoring bad websites, or removing hateful content without review, or taxing the crap out of all the major streaming sites, it will end the same way. in failure. 

we have vpns that allow us to get around these blocks with relative ease and if we have to resort to such thing because the canadian government can't handle regular canadians having free expression on the internet anylonger, well i would expect myself to at least reconsider where my support for this government is. it would remind me a lot of china where they have strongly regulated the internet in every single possible way.  


a scenario i'll briefly get into here will be how 5 years ago before crypto currency really became mainstream, it was relatively easy to buy and sell bitcoin as well as different crypto currencies without having to go through a ton of kyc. today it could not be harder they want your full name, they want a copy of your id, they want your sin, etc. which yeah i understand why, it's needed to prevent money laundering and terrorism and us regular taxpaying canadians should have no issue with it. but it's the regulation that i take issue with. it's a failure because i as a canadian can still find tons of websites to buy and sell crypto currencies on without said kyc. without the regulation. it is still out there, and it always will be.

 a) develop domestic production which was entirely possible, providence put a very good proposal in front of them, this was the choice britan went with to build something from scratch and it worked great for them. 

b) work a deal with a reputable foreign supplier like pfizer and do what was necessary to be at the front of the line. isreal did this and it worked great for them. 

c) do a deal with a chinese firm who had montreal ties despite the fact that we've been in a bitter dispute with the chinese for years now, which nobody did because it's stupid.

go5weu7,2021-02-20T06:15:39.000-08:00,"majority of canadians think royal family 'no longer relevant' 

actually, that's the conventional thinking. we may not need an overhaul of the constitution or a coalition or whatever. 

http://canadian-republic.ca/faq.html

&gt;there are many areas of contention that a parliamentary committee could help clarify. for one: section 41(a) of the constitution actually refers to amendments to \"the office of the queen,\" not the institution of the monarchy. so it may be possible to keep the integrity of \"the office of the queen\" unchanged, with an elected canadian as the office holder.
&gt; 
&gt; it's not certain that provincial approval would be needed to do this anyway. with only parliamentary approval, the succession to the throne act, 2013 (bill c-53) appears to have already changed who can occupy the office of the queen - without provincial approval. cementing its legitimacy, and possibly creating an ironclad precedent, the act was upheld in ontario and quebec courts.
&gt; 
&gt; even if the provinces do have to agree in unison, the degree of difficulty in obtaining that approval is overrated. what if the selection process for a future canadian head of state was delegated to the provinces? if the vast majority of canadians desired an end to the monarchy, the provinces could find this a very attractive option.
&gt; 
&gt; constitutional scholar edward mcwhinney also theorizes that a future government of canada could, after the queen ends her reign, cut ties to the monarchy \"quietly and without fanfare by simply failing legally to proclaim any successor to the queen in relation to canada,\" leaving the position of sovereign vacant.[6]  
&gt; 
&gt; there are even questions about the legitimacy of the present 1982 amending formula. in a blatant example of foreign interference in canada's internal affairs, british high commissioner sir john ford lobbied the premiers extensively to insist that they block approval of prime minister pierre trudeau's repatriation, unless they insisted on a tougher amending formula relating to the monarchy. his term in canada was cut short due to this meddling",liberals

i'm not sure if you're saying this because you're unaware or because you're being disingenuous. alberta and saskatchewan have recently exercised their authority under the current framework to select their own cfo instead of a federally-appointed one. it's been very much anticipated that those provinces would use this authority to expand atc permits to some extent. 

the provincially-relevant part of this bill isn't to \"spare the provincial governments of having to make that decision themselves.\" it's to do an end-run around those provinces because they likely plan to exercise their current amount of local discretion in a way that the trudeau government doesn't like. it's the exact opposite of the ethos being argued for \"giving communities more local control.\"

now that you've been brought up to speed that removing power from provincial authorities *isn't* welcome or being done as a *favour*, i'll put the question to you again: *are you against the federal government doing the exact opposite with the provinces that they're doing with municipalities?*

that's a nice anecdote, but the data does not reflect this now or historically, as seen [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/housing-starts). the rate of immigration per year by itself has been outpacing housing starts by 100,000, and that's *total* not just sfh.

&gt; i don't feel like there is any coercion away from owning a sfh.

coercion is what you just proposed! it's a reference to your words (\"limits building sfhs\"), not existing policy, but seeing it now i did not word it accurately. 

&gt; in practice, everyone wants to live in the same areas and those areas are limited. 

the expansion of suburbs flies in the face of this.

&gt; the vast majority of land that is taken over by sfh developments is prime farmland that can never be recovered once destroyed.

all land that has been used for city development has historically been fertile. that is of no bearing. if land is within city-limits, the suitability for farmland is irrelevant. there is no shortage of suitable farmland outside of it. 

&gt; sfh are net-negative tax income for a city due to the services (water, elec, gas, etc) costing more than the property taxes from the single owner. we all benefit when cities \"stand tall\" instead of \"sprawl\".

you're referring to suburbs as economic districts, not houses in and of themselves. there's no reason we can't both increase density of city-centers (with mixed density buildings) and build more houses to boot. 

the net tax return of the city is what matters, not the case of certain districts yielding less money.

&gt; population growth is a race against the usa who will overwhelm us if we can't keep up.

there is no race. that's not even a question, they have 20 trillion gdp over us. 

it's coy to entertain the idea of catching up to the u.s. as though this would not necessitate destructive land encroachment, much less that the majority should satisfy themselves with a lower quality of life to achieve such a feat. it's like chastising people to consume less, while at the same time suggesting we need bodies to drive up the gdp (a reflection of consumption) - pick one. 

&gt; i'm all for slowing immigration, but we do need it. 

only to the end of enriching the richest among us. the gdp is not an accurate reflection of national prosperity, 99% of it goes to the top. iceland seems to be doing fine with 364,000 people.

we can't have our cake and eat it too. if land encroachment is the primary concern, then the only sensible directive is to limit growth. conversely if rapidly growing is of the essence, then be prepared for more consumption, more electricity usage, more pollutants from industry, more transportation, more land encroachment. that will be true whether people are forced to live in small dwellings or otherwise - everyone has an environmental footprint. i see no evidence that we *need* more people at all.",liberals

the democrats had a majority and didn't shove through reforms that would have saved their country from the current fiasco; the liberals had one term of majority during a prosperous economy and they basically just upheld the status quo while passing some things that are popular with canadians rather than taking that chance to enact changes (changes that isn't a good idea to enact during a crisis like the pandemic).

finally, the hilarious quote in the original star article was:

*for much of the liberals’ time in office, housing prices have climbed relentlessly, particularly in the big cities and suburbs that are home to liberal mps. expensive housing has kept young people out of the market, much to the dismay of people wanting to start families and live near work, and* ***to the bane of employers hoping to lure new people to their workplaces.***

that is a perfectly reasonable policy, just make it so the private clinics have to do x amount of public services as well. much like the private surgeries offered in trudeau's hometown of montreal have helped that province with some wait times.

in particular, this point was thought-provoking,

&gt;there's also a massive need to create affordable housing. to be honest, i don't find anyone credible on this. the bottleneck to creating affordable housing isn't so much $ (though this is needed), but it's regulatory. these projects get blocked.

it makes me think about the criticism levied at the liberal's in regards to increasing the cmhc budget [when they have only spent 49% of their current budget.](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/08/10/canadas-housing-strategy-having-limited-impact-on-housing-need-pbo-says.html)

i think it is probably the correct move to increase the cmhc fund, but it will be futile unless the hurdles blocking development are lifted. that is, the cmhc having these funds will only be of use if housing development is accessible. the fact that they have only spent half their budget is most likely indicative of this; they aren't saving the funds for a rainy day.

unfortunately most of the hurdles to this are local problems, seated in municipal/provincial politics. can the federal government mingle in these jurisdictions? indirectly. carrots and sticks are the answer here. to which, if the liberals were to steal anything from the cpc housing policy, i wish it was the promise of building transit infrastructure. this is an absolute boon, and a fantastic way to entice municipalities to zone more residential areas and fight back against nimby's. promise transit funding, but only if the municipality meets some minimum requirements for zoning residential development with some special demands for high density and low-cost housing.",liberals

&gt;our integrated north  american partner - the united states - does not yet  have a national carbon pricing system.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;rather than choosing an arbitrary carbon price in  advance, we’ll tie canada’s industrial carbon price to that  of our biggest trading partners - the european union and  the united states, starting with those regions that have  carbon markets and expanding as the u.s. creates a national market.  
&gt;  
&gt;this will ensure that we travel the path  to our paris targets together while reducing the risk that  serious climate action will just shift jobs out of canada to  competitor countries.

this is the correct approach imho. canada is a small emitter, addressing the carbon issue is one that you need everyone to be on board with. even if canada emitted 0 tons/year on the global scale that would be a drop in the bucket.

that is not an independent assessment. they were paid for results. this company works for oil companies and energy producers. if the cpc wanted evidence, they should send their plan to an actual economist and compare it to the real world instead of a stagnant artificial strawman (that other parties won’t do anything/have no other plans for the next ten years). 

the actual pdf linked reads like they are just promoting the plan. it explicitly says that the pricing will be less effective, but if you include the “flexible regulations” that have not been clearly detailed at all, then it may be better than carbon pricing alone. it doesn’t take into account that other party’s will also have more going on than just the price, either.

granted, the alternative is silly in the sense that it's less pro-market and more beaurocratic and burdensome than a carbon tax proper and isn't high enough to meet emissions targets, but the fact the cpc is finally conceding that a carbon tax is a viable climate plan and less costly/more pro-market than the alternatives is a significant improvement to where they were on climate policy beforehand.

obviously, they're still behind the other parties on climate policy, but at least they're much less farther behind than they were before this proposal. with more centrist/competent leaders building on this post o'toole, it actually makes the cpc transitioning away from their failed 5+ year anti-carbon tax crusade to a viable climate plan attainable (though that would also depend on the post o'toole leadership).",conservatives

since he couldn't get his party to buy in he had to come up with some scheme that would allow him and his mps to say \"it's not a tax.\" with a straight face. they only way he could come up with was the crazy notion that it's not a tax if the government never actually touches the money.

what you get is a tax that the government can't collect. a climate incentive program that does nothing to incentivize any to reduce their carbon use and a rebate that you can only use for a specific list of goods and services. also the rebate would be less because a portion would be siphoned off to pay whoever is contracted to handle this nutball plan.

but it's pretty much guaranteed that our 2020 and 2021 emissions have been lower - they were already expected to drop because of coal plant closures, and then covid caused a much bigger drop due to telecommuting, less travel, etc.

anyway, i think the liberals have implemented some good climate policies (e.g. carbon tax, coal phase-out, ev incentives, transit expansion, industry regulations), that should reduce emissions a lot in the coming years, but it takes time.

most of those policies took years to develop, and only started taking effect in 2019, 2020, etc.  and some ramp up over time, like the carbon tax was only $20/tonne in 2019 (which wouldn't have much impact).  but now it's $40/tonne and they've signalled that it'll keep rising until it's $170/tonne in 2030, so companies have to take it more seriously in their long term planning and investments, whether it means closing coal plants, buying cleaner equipment/vehicles, etc.

35% reduction from 2005 levels for ghgs covered under the eu emissions trading scheme seems pretty effective to me

if you prefer a country with a conservative government, let's look at the uk which has cut their emissions 38% from 1990 levels.  a huge chunk of that is due to 93% of coal power being replaced because of the carbon tax.

i think what's happening is that the people just dont want a majority, but they do want a progressive agenda in general. 

i don't like the popular vote metric because, well, it doesnt matter and it doesnt make sense to care. the cpc generally really runs up their numbers in the prairies very high. but they are one party. the ndp/lpc votes combined are ahead of the cpc by nearly 16%. 

they share a lot of the same general policy stances, so if anything, it says to me that the party that really isn't reflected in the majority is the cpc not the lpc. maybe people are voting progressive for policy and against the liberal management of it - which is fair, but thats exactly the point of confidence and minority parliament scenarios. these people expect the ndp to push the lpc and keep them in line more than anything else. 

i think they don't see the cpc as a viable opposition in their vote because they don't like the platform.

so the question is: are these ndp people voting ndp for that management concern? or because they want the lpc to push a bit further left? (in context of how minorities work for example).

likewise, both the lpc and cpc could really use some new blood for the next election. 2019 and 2021 both showed that the electorate aren't exactly that enamored with either's leadership, so both have more to gain than to lose by switching it up for 2023-2026.",conservatives

they're not «\"»experts«\"», they're experts. people can disagree with the courts all they want, but judiciary is the branch that interprets law. and the interpretation of our fundamental rights should be done by legal experts unbiased by the popular opinion of a political party elected by a minority of the population.

our judges aren't making laws, they're interpreting existing laws. the charter is one of those laws. s. 33 is part of that charter. parliament is still supreme in enacting law, including s. 33, and judges are still the ones interpreting it. the problem is that if s. 33 is going to be used every time a ruling is struck down, as ford is doing, it effectively makes s. 2-7 and s. 15 obsolete, and many people feel that is a problem since we clearly felt as a nation that s. 2-7 and s. 15 are important, else we wouldn't have included them to begin with.

this is essentially saying study of history is meaningless if you can argue anything. in reality, certain positions have more evidence than others.

just because some countries managed to achieve rights through other methods doesn't mean canada's method doesn't work. conversely, canada's working doesn't mean it's the best or only method we should or need to rely on. this doesn't change the fact that much of history involves oppression of various minority groups and viewpoints and rights are an instrument to prevent this.

nah, they're \"experts\". there is no such thing as a \"true\" answer to a legal question, law is ultimately a subjective domain, not an objective one.

&gt;people can disagree with the courts all they want, but judiciary is the branch that interprets law. 

in a democracy, people's opinion should be able to supersede judiciary interpretation of the law. that's the very definition of the word.

&gt;and the interpretation of our fundamental rights should be done by legal experts unbiased by the popular opinion of a political party elected by a minority of the population.

who names those \"experts\"? i think there is a place for professional judges in a democracy, but as the name says, in a democracy, if people disagree with the actions and opinions of those professionals, the popular will should be able to supersede them.

&gt;our judges aren't making laws, they're interpreting existing laws. 

[judge-made law is one of the foundations of common law systems.](https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-191028.pdf) the idea that judges just \"interpret\" the law is a myth told to reconcile democracy and common legal practices in canada. in practice, their \"interpretation\" often makes new laws or modify laws.

legal systems where judges do not make laws but only interpret them do exist in civil law countries where there is no such thing as case law, and judges do not have the right to refer to previous rulings to guide their own ruling, but must only apply codified laws.

&gt;this is essentially saying study of history is meaningless if you can argue anything. in reality, certain positions have more evidence than others.

perhaps, but given as you put it that the charter was adopted by elected legislators (though under threat of trudeau acting unilaterally if they didn't consent), i'm not sure the position that has more evidence is the one you think.

&gt;another way to word this is that previously enacted laws are invalidating new acts of parliament.

we’re specifically talking about the subset of the population that has legal access to firearms and the fact that they’re a) not immune to radicalization, and b) not being monitored for signs of it on the platforms that are most actively and effectively used for radicalization.",liberals

i am also willing to bet when the data is released that same age group gave him his current mandate. there is no other explanation for the correlation between his victories and the 17% increase in 18-24 voters in 2017.

it will also explain why singh is directly appealing to that age cohort with his progressive policies live tuition forgiveness and more affordable post secondary options and universal pharmacare (18-24 are rarely able to obtain coverage if not on a parent/guardian plan). or why horgan is pursing universal dental.

so you can go fly a kite with your baseless \"young people don't vote\" narrative. they elected trudeau, they elected horgan and combined with the blm crowd in the us elected biden.",liberals
