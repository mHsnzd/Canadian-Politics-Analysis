approximately 70% of people will be making money from the carbon tax (the 70% percent of lowest emitters). this is offset by the extremely high emissions of the top 30%, which brings the average up. the tax is a direct financial incentive to lower emissions by any means the market can, without shoehorning a specific method.

it feels like the most free, market based, hands off approach possible for the government to lower emissions. decades ago it was a conservative idea, and i think it still should be. the more liberal idea would be having loads of specific government programs and boutique tax breaks, enlarging government, with fewer broad market based incentives. this was essentially scheer's plan in 2019 and really rubbed me the wrong way.",conservatives

however, in practice, caretaker-like behaviour persists. cabinet hasn’t met since before the writ dropped, and won’t meet again until after the shuffle, so no new policies are rolling out, except for the essentials and stuff that can be approved by the pm and minister of finance alone. ministers (other than the pm and deputy pm) and their staff aren’t doing more than the essential minimums on their files since they don’t know where they’ll be going when the shuffle comes. and there’s no central agenda yet from pmo/pco, since that’s part of the transition process and will come after the shuffle (first informally, then formally with the new mandate letters). and departments don’t want to engage ministers on anything complex since they don’t know if they’ll have to transition in someone totally new in a couple weeks.

the result - caretaker-like behaviour which extends beyond the writ period. essentially a prolonged transition period. this isn’t unusual of course, but it is unusually long.",liberals

h8mcixo,2021-08-11T15:13:52.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] first of all, i'm not being entirely serious. but, it's hard to convey a tone of bemused false bravado that on one side says exactly how you feel about a matter while on the other side stakes out an illogical extreme of opinion that you don't ever think will come true.

second of all it's a canard to think that canada can stop alberta's exports when we're in an effective monopsony with the united states.

thirdly there are treaties that protect landlocked countries from being take advantage of by the countries that control coastlines.

fourthly, there's more that travels through alberta than oil and gas. there's electricity, the cpr and cnr mainlines, the trans-canada highway and air travel all off of the top of my head. a blocking transportation is a cut that goes both ways.

fifthly, even with in the supposedly united confines of this thing we call canada, alberta already has legislation in place that would allow it to cut fuel to exports to bc. look at the furor that michigan's attempt to terminate line 5 is causing. don't tempt be too quick to tempt fate.

sixthly, it isn't inconceivable that an attempt to box in alberta would lead other provinces to want to jump ship. namely bc (if it's going to cut a deal why not do it for itself) itself and saskatchewan (bros4lyfe). (i think we all know that if there's a separate alberta a separate québec beat us out the door.)

seventhly, it wouldn't look terribly promising to the international community if canada's reaction to the democratic will of its own people (let's pretend this went down in a orderly fashion) was to immediately try to spite them.

my guess is that the best canada would probably get in the breakup negotiations would be to get alberta to assume a certain amount of the national debt with no ongoing obligation for royalties and investment protections and market access for say the telecoms and big 6 banks. \"wexit\" (or whatever stupid name it's given) would no doubt be a tortuous multi-year long affair that would probably end in a series of mutually beneficial trade and economic agreements. and probably at least a guarantee of neutrality from canada if alberta tried to join usmca, nato, tpp, the un, etc.

and don't be so quick to assume it'll be liberals for ever either. why would canadians trust them after their fantastic management of the country chased away the richest province? ironically, i suspect a post breakup rump-canada would probably behave itself more like the kind of country alberta would have wanted to be in. a rational, self interested place that would press every advantage for the betterment of its own citizenry. cutting off the nose to spite the face would only deepen the pain, despite the temporary payoff in schadenfreude.",liberals

h5meye0,2021-07-17T22:09:25.000-07:00,"how can right-wingers organise when we're being banned online and from using services? so let me see if i can summarize what you’re saying:

1. blacks are more violent and prone to crime
2. blacks have lower iq which also leads to crime
3. blacks don’t take accountability for their situation because… we’re not a christian enough society?

alright. any conservatives on this reddit want to step in and explain how completely wrong this is? the driving factors for crime are: poverty, education and employment for youth. these are universal across the globe. race only comes into the picture because these factors tend to get clustered into race-based demographics. and it’s a different group in different countries. i’ll leave it to you to figure out why that might be the case. 

as a society built on the christian concepts of compassion and charity, we have a moral duty to alleviate the suffering of others. addressing poverty and providing strong education and employment support through all tiers of our society seems like a very christian thing to do. 

you’re right that jesus taught that we have personal accountability. but it’s personal accountability in service to god - and that’s to live a life of compassion and charity to your fellow man. nowhere did jesus preach to leave others to suffer or blame them for their shortcomings. 

now i’m of course only talking about the new testament and the specifics of christ’s sermons.",conservatives

it's well within the federal governments purview to collect taxes and give the health transfer to provinces based on whether or not they include more levels of care, including pharmaceutical (but also potentially dental, ocular, and mental health care also). it creates an incentive system that makes it advantageous for the provinces to sign on.

that's why people think the jurisdiction argument is weak - the federal government can't directly administer healthcare through the provinces, but it does set the national policy environment that can induce the provinces to act, and again given the fact we do have the healthcare system that we do, it's been successful up until this point. why not expand it?",liberals

&gt; almost half of them (46 percent) live in ontario and well over half of them (59 percent) are women. a quarter were born outside canada. their average age is 42 and the plurality are between 30 and 44 years old. if they were voting in a federal election today, 35 percent would vote liberal, 25 percent conservative, 17 percent ndp, 9 percent green — pretty similar to overall voting intentions for the entire population.

it's basically describing the average typical canadian and average typical voter. 42 is close to the average age of a canadian. 46% in ontario isn't far off from how many canadians live in ontario. the voting preference, at the time the poll was conducted, wasn't terribly far off from what voting intention polls were showing at the time. _especially_ for abacus data (who conducted this poll) which, at the same time, [released this poll](https://abacusdata.ca/election-2021-liberals-lead-by-9/) which had 37% lib, 28% cpc, 20% ndp.

the biggest outside number there to me was 59% women, but i'd bet dollars to donuts that the demographics of the vaccine \"refusers\" are the flip side favouring the men.

at any rate, the survey seems to describe the quote-unquote \"average typical canadian\", _not_ a 42 year old ontarian woman liberal.

edit: that said, i agree it's definitely plausible that the ppc has pulled support from across the spectrum that way. if they've become a party of single-issue anti-vaxxer/lockdown/covid-deniers, then i could see people coming from all political stripes that way based on a variety of reasons. still, it should still be noted that this article is providing demographics of the \"hesitant\" group that are on the fence about the vaccine, not the die-hard zealots that we see in the media representing the ppc. so i'm not sure how many \"hesitant\" people are joining the ppc vs the \"refusers.\"",liberals

i absolutely love this quote. it seems to me that governments very quickly become concerned almost exclusively with winning the next election and thus won't take on bold changes. liberals in particular are often quite open about this, arguing explicitly that they cannot do anything that may jeopardize their hold on power. yet, it seems that this is a recipe for political stagnation and perhaps it's no coincidence that there are so few major accomplishments of the past 30 years. the political turmoil of implementing medicare in saskatchewan resulted in the defeat of the ccf (ndp), but it fundamentally changed canadian politics and life.

unfortunately, it seems like governments that are here for a \"good time, not a long time\", are now those on the right. kenney's ucp may well lose the next election, but will fundamentally transform alberta. contrast this to the moderate andp. what is their legacy? this willingness to actually spend political capital, even if it risks defeat is why the right is losing battles, but winning the war. the left should take note.",liberals

hfbjk6c,2021-10-03T15:43:01.000-07:00,"will justin trudeau’s new government get serious on canada’s widening wealth inequality? the biggest cause of income inequality and inter-generation inequality in canada (and most other advanced economies) is housing inequality that stems from bad planning systems and land use regulations that both reduce the supply of housing &amp; rentals as whole as well as the variety of housing available (putting an over-emphasis on detached single family homes over multi-family housing).

particularly as the population and economic activity of cities becomes more important to wage growth &amp; improvements to living standards in a globalized economy, when those cities constrain their housing supply it makes it harder for people (especially young people and lower income earners) to live and work in those cities and areas with the higher paying jobs. as the problem gets worse, this translates to wage stagnation, less labor mobility,  less gdp growth and less social mobility which all serve to make growth less inclusive.

on top of that, zoning and land use restrictions contribute to a variety of other socioeconomic problems such as:

* higher emissions/less environmentally sustainable cites due to increased sprawl (leading to longer commute times) and reduced public transit
* obesity
* lower productivity growth
* lower fertility rates
* negatively effecting test scores/student performances based on location
* (in some areas &amp; other countries historically) serve as a tool for racial segregation and racial inequality.

it's one of those things where if the majority of canadians were more informed about the effects of nimbyism and zoning/land use regulations, there'd be overwhelming popular support for zoning &amp; land use reform across the political spectrum.

there's various ways that the government can &amp; should work on reducing income inequality (better social transfers, increased urbanization, reducing discrimination etc.), but it's housing that is the biggest issue in regards to that for advanced economies and if policymakers in all levels of government are serious about addressing inequality, they'll have to do more to listen to the expert consensus on housing policy to actually encourage positive change (particularly in the case of municipal governments).",liberals

i notice you're working very hard to avoid giving any data on that. it's almost as if you just realized i'm right and you're trying to avoid admitting it.  but hey - i can be wrong, it's happened - so show me which of those the gov't initiated and 'broght the right people in' to solve. 

&gt;the problems were solved by the liberal government investing money into the issue and getting people in to fix the problems.

ok - so show me which ones of the list you made are actually ones the feds initiaed and 'got the right people for' and funded. 

i know of only a few and they were brutally simple - just running pipe and a pump station or two in order to tie them into existing municiple lines. 

in fact - despite the fact that it's their responsiblity they've been giving far less money to the first nations than they would get if they were a municipality or community funded by the province. 

and i know a little about this. 10 years ago the community i'm in were on wells. it was decided that they wanted secure clean water, they raised money and the province kicked in, took about 2 years and 3 pump/filter stations and piping run to every home and guess what - crystal clean water. at the time it was gravity fed so there were some homes on the hill which didn't get done. new extra pump stations got put in 2 years ago, they've all got it now. 

its work, and it cost money - but pretty easy in the long run. 

so.... where's the feds? a first nations community anywhere in canada (except bc where the province handles it) would still be waiting. and if they did get green lit it would take a half a decade. 

so show me all these projects where the feds got involved and made things happen in a timely manner.

mostly short term ones. they reoccur. they put less money into the reserves that each of the provinces put into municipalities. they do next to nothing 

lifting an advisory is not the same as solving the problem. 

but sure - calling me names is pretty convincing :)

&gt;they invested over $4 billion in 535 water infrastructure projects.

how odd - they budgeted over 6 billion within 5 years. now you're saying they spent 4 over almost 2 times that. far less than even what they budgeted which was less than what the provinces spend to resolve issues in communities of similar size.  so they did some of the low hanging fruit. and much of the money is not actually 'spent' but 'committed'. which isn't spent. 

which basically means they did next to nothing. and about the same number of bands are under advisory today. 

many of their 'investments' didn't actually result in any water. for example. in attawapiskat‘s case, the government earmarked $1.5-million to repair an existing treatment plant and said there are plans for a second system. eabametoong declared a state of emergency after the water developed a “noticeable foul smell and taste,”however the community has been under a boil-water advisory for nearly two decades. despite the state of emergency, eabametoong expected the “long-term” advisory to lift in august because of a new water treatment plant.

as of late september, however, the community was still under an advisory.

they spent a little to make it look like they were making progress before an election but solved nothing. 

or how about six nations, . the government gave the community money for a treatment plant, but that was it — “no money to operate it,” . wthe community took the money, built their “state-of-the-art treatment plant and said: ‘we’ll figure it out'.’”

now, six nations has the treatment plant,but people still live without clean drinking water because almost nobody has piping into their houses that can carry in the newly clean water. in other words, only a small percentage of the population gets clean water — everyone else needs to buy big jugs of fresh water.

that would cost little to fix. are the libs interested? no. 

the list goes on and on.

and all of that is assuming laïcité isn't something that is pursued by many western and arabic states. it serves a purpose to some. people need to understand that it is a value that some societies, especially those that were targeted by intense religious powers in the past, value. someone who's part of the the dominant culture of this planet (anglo-saxon/american) may not be able to appreciate this notion since they have such a melting pot effect towards their immigrants.

there's a huge difference between not being able to wear a cross, which is largely not mandated by christianity, and not being able to wear a turban for example, which is mandated by some religions.

so i checked the definition of nationalization.  it means for the government to buy it.  you might have a different definition but mine is in a dictionary
to invest control or ownership of in the national government
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalization#other-words

the government did announce that they want to privatize it after construction was completed but i'm not sure they can privatize something that wasn't owned (nationalized) by them earlier.  they also nationalized it because it wasn't going to be built otherwise and it is a major piece of infrastructure that is considered a benefit to canada (if it didn't benefit canadians there would be no point in the federal government buying it).

your definition of a progressive pm seems more to be someone who believes it is more important to get mired down in constitutional jurisdiction debates then one who wants to work with others to try and get a goal by.  i guess a truly progressive could have rebuilt parallel infrastructure to bypass the all ready existing programs (like hospitals) that way seems to have a lot more overhead costs that would limit how much it helps people.  i don't think it is productive to have the federal and provincial government competing with each other over things like nurses or appropriate buildings for sick people (or the equipment to care for them).

i also checked the definition of progressive

hi8lgbb,2021-10-26T22:19:42.000-07:00,"trudeau says he plans to lead liberals into next federal election i actually despise freeland more than trudeau.  i don't think i'm alone in this.

someone like minister joly could however increase liberal votes.  if she does well in foreign affairs she will be canada's next female pm, not freeland.",liberals

i don't think they have any chance at getting another majority with trudeau at the helm unless he is squeaky clean until the next election and we all know that's not going to happen.",liberals
gmki9v2,2021-02-07T18:42:01.000-08:00,nanos research - lpc: 35% - cpc: 30.3% - ndp: 15.5% - bq: 8.5% - gpc: 7.4% - ppc: 2.5% mackay literally wrote the leadership rules. he simply was not popular enough amongst enough conservatives. he had a chance but the pandemic delayed the campaign and o'toole campaigned very hard digitally and carried qc and convinced socons to put him as their 3rd choice. without the pandemic we'd likely have mackay as leader.,conservatives

h0atqck,2021-06-01T21:05:28.000-07:00,"conservatives call on feds to end blood deferral for gay men all while one of their 'shadow ministers' [endorsed and introduced a petition](https://pressprogress.ca/conservative-mp-sponsored-petition-from-anti-lgbtq-pastor-who-is-calling-for-civil-disobedience-to-oppose-conversion-therapy-bill/) into the house of commons that calls for civil disobedience to resist a ban on conversion therapy.

and while the vast majority of their caucus prepares to vote against banning conversion therapy after their party has spent months delaying the bill.

so pardon me while i remain beyond skeptical that this is coming from a place of sincerity.",conservatives

fully agreed though. robellus should be renting the infrastructure from a state company. i bet the government, directly and indirectly, funded a good half of the network development they did anyway. we should buy back their part and then we would be the level 1 provider they'd all rent from.",liberals

got news for your pal, gay rights are human rights and so called ‘conversion therapy’ is child abuse, even if it’s run by a religious institution or official. 

glad to have my point about sincerity proven though, thanks!",conservatives
