- carbon tax - even if we do not receive refund back, i don't mind paying a bit extra to protect the environment. that is an important issue for me. the same way i don't mind paying a bit extra to support local businesses.

-we scandal- because i took time to read reports and news paper articles from various sources in order to understand  the issue. i understand that the scandal is mostly manufactured. that trudeau's only possible ethical violation is that he should have left the meeting due to perceived conflict of interest. i also know, because i took time to read past headlines, the we charity would not have received 800m. most of that money was for students.  obviously, we and other charities would receive a certain pourcentage for administration fees. nobody should expect them to do the work without being compensated.

-snc lavalin- while i do believe that pm should not pressure ag when it comes to prosecution, it was not sure whether they were asking why dpa was not considered or to apply dpa. the recorded phone cail was obviously staged. i personally think that dpa should have been considered.
in the end, the consequences for snc lavalin ended up lesser consequences than if dpa was applied.

i'm actually not that worried that he could win the next election. i've been at this game a long time and spent many hundreds of hours during the harper years and before working on campaigns and you kind of get a feel for who's got room for improvement and who doesn't. o'toole ran a decent race and made two major mistakes which cost him a win.  but i believe he can learn from his mistakes and do better. just like harper did. 

however - there is obviously some question about whether or not the party wants him to be prime minister at all. he broke his promise many times after being elected leader and obviously has no problem lying and saying whatever he thinks people want to hear to get what he wants and while that works for a liberal leader (hell it's practically a prerequisite) conservatives don't like that. if we did we'd just vote for justin.

if that’s what you got out of it, you’re mistaken. i was taking issue with the attempt to weaponize this to gain cheap political points. the narrative of this over at postmedia is that it’s a liberal scandal. that’s not true at all, they are merely a part of it. my aunt was raped and abused in the early 90s, these issues have existed for decades, and every government that has been in power since this has become an issue is just as complicit in allowing this to happen as the current liberal government.


harper’s government put vance into this position, despite being aware of rumours/allegations, they even opened an investigation, which was suddenly stopped when they gave him the job.

restaurants demanding a sexy uniform is a bit of a different story.  nobody is forcing anyone to work at those establishments.  if someone applies at hooters, it’s with the understanding that they will have to wear an objectifying uniform.

i’m not sure i can think of other dress codes that systemically discriminate against ideologies except for those requiring political neutrality.  religious symbols broadcast the wearer’s adherence to a specific religious ideology.  just like you can assume a lot about a person wearing a maga hat, you can infer a lot about a person’s worldview by the religious symbols they wear.  if no political or religious symbols are visible, none of these assumptions can be made.  i think the push for neutrality (especially for teachers) is to ensure there is no (or at least a minimum amount) of political or religious influence on the students.  but it also goes the other way.  what if teacher and student have opposing world views?  what if the student feels offended by the teacher’s opposing worldview?  what if the teacher is unable to get respect from a student that rejects the teacher’s worldview outright?

in most circumstances i would agree, however, i don't think any amount of money makes this go away.  how much money would you accept for the life of your son or daughter?  

either way, beyond what the first nations have suffered, they already knew what was happening in these schools; they told us, and we didn't listen.  so this is also about \"us\", whatever that means - canada, the government, the institutions, the system.  this wasn't the fault of the people who endured this system.  some of the attitudes that led to residential schools still exist and inform our public policy.

it's not just emotional distress.  there is a political dimension to this, but i don't think it's about parties and elections.  i think there's an opportunity to consider what this country really is.

&gt;especially with jt at the helm.

joe clark proposed a \"community of communities\" and mulroney tried to create a quebec nation within the nation (and meech was partly torpedoed by an indigenous politician).  harper issued the historic apology and recognized the quebec nation.  so there are numerous non-liberal examples of movement on these things.  but this is a complicated country, more complicated than we are willing to admit, with many sources of power.

&gt;those undercurrents are either the result of, or the precursor to, money.

but yes, it mostly comes down to money.  because we can't erase what we did, and because and it needs addressing, and because the federal government's power is limited to money and little else, that is likely how we will try to address the historical crime that has occurred.  that said, i don't think it's good to ignore the real emotional distress of discovering a mass grave of children in *canada*.",liberals

there are loud idiots across the spectrum, but the majority of the voting left is beyond interested in implementing policy. just because people have a bad taste in their mouths over the abandonment of significant policies that could have had the potential to do so much greater good for our country than say legalization (of marijuana, i'm assuming), does not make individuals on the left cynics. that just means that they have a working brain between their ears and can spot the shallow intentions of a government like our current one.

even though trudeau has done well in some areas, it's the pandering campaign platforms that crumble away to the reality of what he is actually offering that gives people plenty of very good reason to be skeptical. how is one to ascertain what a party or leader will do if they rely, and heavily i might add, on dishonesty to win an election? you really can't. you would have to be completely naive to not be skeptical.",liberals

i'm not saying that young people shouldn't vote or that they shouldn't vote strategically, i'm just saying that there are other factors so much more significant in our political landscape, that i feel like you're placing a little too much blame on a group of people who have too little say in things to begin with. we won't start to see more significantly progressive policies until there's a much greater generational shift and that's kinda just the way that it is (and has always been).",liberals

very few women in politics have balls of steel to actually stick to our guns and not capitulate to emotions. thatcher is one of the greats, steamrolled with the economy and defeated argentina. clinton is not, her platform was the same suspects, feminism and emotions. catherine the great is a good historical example, won many wars and made russia a great power. cleopatra is not, she was good with the economy but clueless about war, steamrolled by the roman empire. time and again women in politics usually means a disaster for national security, very few women in politics are capable beyond economics, and even then its a shaky record.

yeah, this imagery is really bad. but by all objective metrics the trudeau government has made record investments in first nations and a possibly the first “real” effort in reconciliation. the progress on boil water advisories is no joke, the government has been negotiating with indigenous communities on their own timelines to bring those willing out of the indian act, and the government has implemented many recommendations for reconciliation including funding which has led to the discovery of the graves of children from residential schools - the latter part has more or less been completely ignored by successive governments until now.

then you look at the blackface scandal. yes,  racist gesture and clearly a mistake, but it was over a decade ago when released, and the pm came out and owned up to it upon its release. but it’s hard to paint someone like trudeau as racist when you look at the policies he has implemented in office.

also, what is more important is that despite having heated discussions, there are less attacks on political groups, ad hominem attacks and generally more respectful opinions of political rivals. this is because they ban people for a long time for breaking rule 1b. i created this post because of the laughable and toxic replies i got. i gotta say, i never got called a flat earth theorist before lol

i don't want to say that canadapolitics has bad moderators, because i have dealt with r/canada mods... but the whole atmosphere of the sub just doesn't feel right. i think it is because everyone is even more divided because of trump. maybe i will start posting there more often once trump is out of the news cycle. still, i think the mods need to make a better effort in keeping the discussions civilized.

what is more, and with all due respect, many that are unfamiliar with security studies confuse what canadian peacekeeping actually entails, as it would be more aptly described as peace-*enforcing.* this of itself is neither necessarily good nor bad as one would first need to examine each mission case by case, and one can even find examples where genocide and other mass atrocities was greatly enabled by foreign intervention being to limited.

so, though i don’t love it, i understand the politicos who refuse to answer questions from them.  it would be like o’toole answering questions from the independent get trudeau re-elected organization.

beyond that, quebec is fairly reliant on transfers from canada for many of it's popular social programs. dry up that influx and where is the money coming from? honestly, given how the language laws have driven so many larger corporations from quebec (montreal used to be the center of canada, not toronto. quebec's language laws drove them all out to toronto).

hobhuss,2021-12-12T08:47:40.000-08:00,"338canada: the quebec liberals in free-fall &gt; the caq is promising they're past sovereignty... for now. but most of them are ex-pq, if the federal encroaches (say if they'd force legault's govt to re-hire that muslim teacher), it's back on the menu for sure.

hmm… no. if anything, the caq is mostly ex-adq, not ex-pq, and while it's true that the adq supported the yes camp in 1995 (back when mario dumont was essentially the entire adq caucus and much of the party itself), they moved away from outright separatism soon afterwards. before its takeover of the adq, françois legault saw the caq has an alliance of sovereignists and federalists moving beyond constitutional concerns to tackle quebec's \"real\" problems, and had among its founding members some prominent federalists. more recently, deputy premier geneviève guilbeault caused a bit of a scandal when it came out that she'd berate staff members coming from other political parties but especially the pq, calling them \"crisses de péquistes\" (fucking pequists) on several occasions.

lots has been said about legault still being a secret separatist attempting to spring a surprise referendum out of nowhere, but the reality is that before he could even get that far, he'd have to overcome strong opposition within his own party. maybe françois legault still dreams of an independant quebec at night when he falls asleep, but at this point, his only real contribution to the cause would be his attempt to close the economic gap between quebec and the rest of the country. otherwise, if someone is to finally bring the sovereignists to the promised land, it's not going to be him or someone in his party.",liberals

hobk8ju,2021-12-12T09:05:03.000-08:00,"338canada: the quebec liberals in free-fall i'm not. more the opposite. the ultimate irony of bill 21 is the way it mirrors the sort of attitudes and practices quebecois used to have to rebel against. in particular, the caq justification for its treatment of minority religious practices is near word-for-word with what an orange lodge guy would have said about french catholicism when backing the manitoba schools persecution.

having said that, the original question i was responding to was questioning whether there had been francophobic bigotry in canada in the past. i was providing a couple of egregious examples and trying to provide some context that a 21st century person might understand. loi 21 is the kind of thing that, for example, a francophone in new brunswick would have faced in the 1960's, as the anglophone majority figured that cultural heterogeneity was dangerous to social cohesion, and that catholics could not be trusted to put their duties to their country first or take an even hand among members of the public.",liberals
