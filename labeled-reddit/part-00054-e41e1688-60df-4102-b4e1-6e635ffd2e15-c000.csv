h25nswi,2021-06-17T10:49:52.000-07:00,"‘i am not a token:’ chrystia freeland fires back at annamie paul’s accusation she is trudeau’s ‘female shield’ this is incredibly irritating. anyone who is even slightly familiar with ms. freeland's work would be acutely aware she is an **extremely** competent and passionate public servant, and is also a pretty rad [journalist](https://muckrack.com/cafreeland/articles).

i'm not just saying that. our deputy prime minister is one of the most scholastically accomplished individuals we have working in our government at the moment, and having such a well-informed individual helping to form our economic strategy is definitely a positive for canadians. here's a brief excerpt (paraphrased) from her wikipedia page:

&gt;freeland studied russian history and literature at harvard university, and earned a master's degree in slavonic studies from oxford university.  
&gt;  
&gt;she has worked in editorial positions at the financial times, the globe and mail and reuters, becoming managing director of the latter.  
&gt;  
&gt;freeland is the author of sale of the century, a 2000 book about russia's journey from communist state rule to capitalism, and plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else in 2012 (winner of the 2013 lionel gelber prize for non-fiction reporting on foreign affairs, as well as the 2013 national business book award for the most outstanding canadian business-related book).

although her political views sway a little farther left than i would prefer, it is clear as day that ms. freeland's appointment is anything but token. i very much hope she is the leader of the liberal party come the next election; that would make voting liberal again a little more appetizing.

ms. paul's comment was completely off base. there is no reason why both of these individuals can't be stellar role models for young people across canada; i don't see any good being accomplished by throwing shit at each other.",liberals

it's not just conservative rhetoric to blame either. left politics have long ignored the potential to alienate center right and right voters to further cement votes from their camp. overall there seems to be more leftist or liberal tendency voters, but those that might have been center right with a tendency for vote left in the certain scenarios have been pushed further right.

obama was a good president in many ways, but its clear that he was not a president for all americans. beyond the issues with race in the states, obama did little to help conservative voters, preferring to take the tact of outnumbering them by cementing left leaning voters.

it worked, but it also resulted in an overrated president that pushed conservatives further right. then trump comes along and further widens this divide while democrats put in a candidate that is even more out of touch with america at large.

canada is less like this, although conservatives pushed hard last election to capture that american style division. it didn't work so well here in canada for a variety of reasons, many of which are apparent, others perhaps less so.

ha25sjo,2021-08-23T04:01:24.000-07:00,"globe editorial: the conservative climate plan isn’t half bad. but the liberal plan is better. &gt;as part of trying to phase out coal so aggressively and successfully they over did it with natural gas power plants. ontario's energy demand lagged behind what was initially expected (yeah?) so the natural gas plants were less needed but the contracts were signed and had to be honoured. it was one of the reasons that led to them being voted out in 2018.

&gt;so between 2005 and 2017 ontario's co2 output went from 205 megatonnes to 159 megatonnes.

&gt;over a similar period alberta's went up from 235 megatonnes in 2005 to 272 megatonnes in 2017.

i agree with your broader point. part of a bigger argument i'd make is that our federal (and even provincial) leaders have little impact on actual emissions. there is clearly some on the margin, but these factors are controlled by an economy mostly beyond their influence and understanding (or anyone's understanding - so complex). russia hit its kyoto targets in one year... because they're economy shrank so much. 

the ontario liberals also caused huge affordability issues and were hated for their energy policy. they also gave away huge sums: https://canadafactcheck.ca/2016/11/10/6258-2/ &amp; https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/10/10/the-truth-about-hydro-in-ontario-a-fact-check.html

it reduced emissions but was an utter mess. based on your comments i'm probably telling you something you already know.  i would strongly argue that the ontario liberals didn't lose because of the carbon tax but because of massive incompetence and significant affordability and waste with their policy (see above). i'm in bc, so only followed from afar, but i can't recall a provincial government as grossly incompetent as wynne's.

&gt;harper's climate policy was to allow for the massive increase in pollution from the tar sands. provincially in ontario, liberals implemented great change. federally, they passed a carbon tax. the carbon tax (weak as it is, i think it should be higher) lost them their majority in 2019, so don't call the carbon tax nothing.

greenhouse gas emissions from oil &amp; gas haven't really changed under trudeau though. and that's even with decreasing demand. harper was in power during a time of generally high oil demand and trudeau has seen the opposite but gge hasn't changed much from the sector. 

i also think the economic and political issue with the oil sands are much more complicated than many of us concerned with the environment care to admit. canada (particularly quebec) buys our oil from the usa and countries with horrible records like saudi arabia, nigeria, etc. their environmental record there is bad.",liberals

so it looks entirely possible to do with enough government money to subsidize all the training, and to pay for the facilities and beds.

the idea that the cpc could win with o’toole is frankly... a delusion backed by zero data. so what happens when they’ve lost for the third time in a row? what happens to their wealthy, self-interested, corporate donors? why wouldn’t they swap red for blue like they did provincially in bc. what happens to their rabid right wing base who’ve been beaten back internally with the sole argument of “but this is how we win”? what happens when they respond with “but we’re not winning and trump and boris are!”?

the right was divided for nearly a century in this country for a very good reason. the gap between lougheed and clarke with folks like ernest and preston manning was simply larger than the gap between lougheed and clarke with trudeau or pearson. also keeping themselves separated from the likes of the manning’s and keegstras of the country was a winning strategy. that gap was papered over with “but this is how we win”. so what happens when they haven’t won in a while?

the lpc is older than the country it’s in. the ndp have been doing this for 60 years and have won “oo” before, recently. the cpc still wouldn’t be old enough to drink anywhere in canada. that’s the point. this idea that they’re six elections old, on their third leader ever and you’re assuming that they’ll *always* finish 1st or second is **beyond** silly.... particularly since it’s based on exactly zero data and the trend is going in the opposite direction.

i don't see why \"it's not going to happen\". we have the ressources to make it happen. the major spikes in the past few weeks, particularly in hotspots in ontario and quebec, have been linked to new strains and travel, particularly during christmas and new years. countries such as australia and new zealand shut down their borders entirely, and they performed much better in covid response. the reason our numbers keep increasing despite lockdowns and preventative measures is that rather than properly enforcing defensive mechanisms, we have half-assed lockdowns with no-one to ensure that people are actually following the rules.

&gt;the second purpose can justify stricter measures for those recently arrived from countries with more cases than we have, but not dramatically stricter border controls. we already require a negative pcr test and a 14 day quarantine. this is massive overkill.

it isn't overkill, especially when so many people refuse to even follow the quarantine and are still managing to evade consequences. we shouldn't be letting people in to begin with.

&gt;what we could be doing instead of all these insanely costly restrictions is just test most people all the time. if we knew who was infected, everyone else could mostly go back to living a normal life.

what we do know is that testing kits are not entirely accurate. even with more innovation, we've only hit about 50-60% accuracy, so we can't rely exclusively on testing. furthermore, testing in the hotspots is limited due to nursing unions preventing new hires despite being over worked.

at the end of the day, we are in a pandemic. canada comes first. there is no reason why the elites are allowed to travel and put more canadians at risk while the middle-class isn't even allowed to work. if we want to reopen the economy, the best place to start is to ensure that the spread will not increase from outside travel.",liberals

in terms of conservative media, i feel as though we'd seek more nuance as compared to the usa which has very polarizing media sources (cnn vs fox, for example). meanwhile, although canadian media is still left-leaning by all means, i feel as though our media is a lot more centrist in comparison. we have news networks like ctv which tend to be fairly neutral, albeit still a little left-leaning. 

religion plays a far lesser role than in the states. we have a smaller population of conservative christians, and even certain conservatives in québec that still value laïcité actually hope to separate religion from the state even more. 

i feel as \"red lines\" are fluid in canada. i think that's what makes canadian politics great if you ask me. we find nuance as canadians, and often times you can disagree with one party's major policy goals but still vote and support them as a whole. 

ultimately, conservatives and republicans are fairly similar fiscally, but i'd definitely argue that conservatives are more-or so democrat socially. as such, i'd imagine that if conservatives were to move to the states, there would be some that vote republican and others than vote democrat based on where they place their values.",conservatives

gxr6wdq,2021-05-11T03:49:50.000-07:00,"annamie paul isn’t interested in using gimmicks to reach young voters if you're a conservative, it's actually easy for me to understand why you would consider voting green. we're a party of people who want a government that balances its budget and invests taxpayer money responsibly. we want a government that looks at long-term trends rather than the next 3 months or 4 years, that pays attention to the lessons we've learned from the past and applies them to our current problems. all of the spending/revenue policies we're pushing forward stem from those priorities on long-term thinking and responsible investments.

we support protecting our food security and becoming more self-reliant, investing in our rural communities and infrastructure, careful stewardship of our natural resources so we don't waste them. we support stable funding for municipalities to support decision-making at the local community level, instead of ottawa arbitrarily deciding what the rest of the country needs every time they want to hand out a pile of cash. we support investments in preventive care to save our healthcare system money, and investments in senior care so our seniors can live in their communities as long as possible. there are plenty of things that progressives and conservatives should be able to agree on- and we used to have a party willing to explicitly call itself progressive conservative because of that.

it's important to remember that conservatives today don't really have that much resemblance to small-c conservatism. conservatism is about protecting the social and physical structures we've built, about protecting families and society in a changing world. it's about not spending beyond our means. but the policies of today's conservative party will destabilize our society and put canadians at risk. the green party is about planning for our long-term future, not just the next 4 years. it's about responsible investment in our infrastructure and careful stewardship of our resources- so that both will be around when our grandchildren have to make their own decisions. that's an alignment and attitude that resonates with small-c conservatives.

remember, sustainability used to be called conservation- protecting the environment we live in from being squandered for short-term profits. farmers understand that need. retirees understand that need. immigrants understand that need. the progressive conservatives used to understand that need. the modern conservative party no longer seems to, and its voters who still do need a family to come home to.",conservatives

i respect your suspicion towards utopian ideologies like libertarianism and socialism. i'm actually relieved by it. however, there is already a libertarian party in canada. i'm not going to sit here and tell you that there aren't similarities between the small-gov ppc and the no-gov libertarians, because that's simply not true. however, using this logic we may as well claim that the liberals and socialists are similar enough to make it difficult to tell apart.

and you're completely right about notions of freedom and individual liberty being used as covers for genuinely evil groups and ideas. still, you can point at any well-meaning political ideology and trace how people will take advantage of it. it's a matter of weighing out the unintended consequences

regardless, we as a society will never be able to completely eradicate bigotry, racism, and tribalism. we can sit here all day and agree that these are truly evil people, and that the world would be a far greater place without them. to us, these truths are self-evident, but this just isn't the case for everybody.
we have to shine a light onto bigotry, like any kind of termite or roach, and engage with it on a public forum. show people that such evil ideologies fall apart under even the slightest pressure. better yet, you can consider people like daryl davis.

taking down websites and trying to cancel people isn't a viable long term solution. it doesn't convince bigots that there's something wrong with their way of thinking. it just drives them further underground, only to become more and more extreme.

the solution isn't to make such ideas illegal because it simply doesn't work. overreaching speech laws have far too much potential to be expanded further and further until they're used to silence political dissidents. this is already happening in countries like scotland.

onto gun laws. i fully support background checks, and i understand the reasoning behind non-restricted and restricted licenses. handguns aren't banned, they're restricted. while \"assault rifle\" has no real definition, i understand what you're referring to: a semi or fully automatic long gun, probably ar platform, with heavy modding options. these are banned.

still, i see existing gun laws as ill informed. rifles and shotguns (particularly the latter) are far more dangerous than pistols by every metric, despite being far more accessible as they're considered non-restricted. you can argue that pistols are more easily concealed and thus more dangerous, though all you need is a hacksaw and a gym bag to illegally modify and carry a non-restricted weapon. all of sudden, you have a weapon that is far more lethal than a pistol will ever be.

that's even before we touch the fact that well over 90% of gun crime is perpetrated with illegally owned guns, particularly pistols, particularly by gangs. this is in spite of these increasingly severe gun laws, a trend you can see across the world. in the end, background checks are probably the most proven way to prevent crime with legally owned firearms. 

i think rifles, shotguns, and pistols should fall under non-restricted, though have stricter requirements. automatic weapons should be restricted, and be extremely difficult to get. prohibited weapons can stay as is.

of course different groups will collide. political parties aren't homogenous entities, with the ppc being the ad-hoc exception. there will always be in-fighting. conversations, debates, and arguments need to be had in a functioning democracy, even with topics that appear so self-evident it's almost not worth the time.",liberals

inflation has been the apocalyptic issue at hand dozens of different times. it is a problem but not a problem that doesn’t address itself on some level, the nature of capitalism is expansion and overproduction so i’m not sure why you’re surprised that inflation rises every decade due to the centralization of wealth. capitalists don’t care about inflation because it only fucks you and i over and allows them to buy shit cheap and keep wages low. it’s a self reinforcing system of class division and upwards wealth allocation.

on the subject of people in power not reflecting their demographics. in this case, we are discussing mps, who are elected by the population. there are several reasons why this may occur. for one, pocs may simply not be running for these positions. why? i do not know. but if this is the case, then it is not fair to blame white males for being elected. secondly, it is possible that the places where they are elected, they do represent the overwhelming majority of the population. in my city of brampton for example, every single conservative candidate was non-white (and actually, every single liberal candidate as well and 4/5 ndp candidates.. 14/15 are non-white of the big 3).  i just think sweeping statements of \"why are there so many white dudes\" just may not be so crazy if you take a closer look. the other thing is that these political parties are picking anyone who they feel will help them get elected. most people don't know anything about their mps. they just see the name associated with the party and check the box. imo, when a party is determining electability, they want to have a group of people representative of the population that may help edge the vote in their direction. i do not believe, therefore, that the cpc would deliberately not select poc as their representatives if that is against their own interest of getting elected. i do not think we are at that level of racism, especially when every party openly talks about and celebrates diversity.

as far as healthcare, you make a good point. there is benefit in having poc in this field, for sure. but again, it may come back to the number of students, the number of applicants, and so forth. i haven't heard of an issue where black or south asian doctors are out of work whereas hospitals are banging at the doors of their white counterparts to hire them. 

i cannot say the degree to which it is or is not a big deal, i guess i just don't like how any of this is framed. instead of asking \"why are there so many white  males?\", why not simply ask \"how do we get more \\[under represented group\\] to pursue politics?\" the first sounds accusatory, exclusionary and quite frankly unkind, the other sounds thought provoking and could generate actual meaningful conversations.

it is beyond me how people are not aware how federal health policy works at this point in the game. the federal government can incentivize the provinces to administer health according to federal guidelines through provincial transfers, much in the same way it does with canada's existing healthcare systems as administered and managed under the canada health act.

that's a different story. we've seen the liberals make these sorts of promises again and again and fail them, and know them to be spurious at best. i'm inclined to be more trusting of the federal ndp's pharmaceutical plan because it's been in their platform for more than a decade, they've repeatedly tried to push it in the last parliament, and it's a cornerstone of singh's platform. i will obviously be supremely pissed if they dropped it all of a sudden in the case they form government, but i'm more confident they'll keep that promise than any promise the liberals are making.",liberals

the ndp is also doing well as opposed to the last week with their numbers being stale. they’re (somewhat unsurprisingly) doing even better with younger voters than the lpc or cpc was doing, also leading the vote in bc.

là je dis ça comme collectivité régionale. mais moi j'annule mon vote. j'aurai un vrai plaisir à mettre des x partout. si jamais y'a un candidat exceptionnel, je voterai peut-être pour eux malgré le parti. mais je penche plus pour l'annulation du vote.

h1cauz3,2021-06-10T09:29:00.000-07:00,"how postmedia has pushed islamophobic attitudes across ontario &gt; if our welfare state is not humane towards indigenous peoples, it is not humane. if our civil service is not decent towards indigenous peoples, it is not decent.

to me the challenges of canada's relations with indigenous peoples in canada are not primarily about issues with public programs (like health insurance, ei, and cpp) or the civil service. it's that **it's not clear what the solutions are**. symbolic actions to acknowledge and apologize for the residential schools - the attempt to forcibly assimilate indigenous children by separating them from their families, punishing them if they spoke their own language, forcing them to do physical labour, and burying them in unmarked graves if they died from tuberculosis, neglect, or abuse - are of course necessary and important, but what happens after that?

joseph heath describes [two models for pluralism](https://www.academia.edu/43470485/two_dilemmas_for_u_s_race_relations): the multinational model, like quebec, where the francophone minority is geographically concentrated and large enough to have its own separate institutions; and the multiculturalism (polyethnic) model, which is basically full integration of immigrants and visible minorities, without requiring them to give up their culture. neither model is a good fit for indigenous peoples in canada, especially when the number of people in the community is small.

&gt; ... the multinational model solves the problem of social integration by not requiring social integration, or more specifically, by being more selective about when social integration is required. instead of just imposing a uniform set of rules on everyone – an arrangement that typically benefits members of the majority culture – it allows different rules to prevail within different groups, whenever the costs of doing so are not too high. of course, in order for these costs to be low, it must be the case that members of the different groups do not interact with one another very often, or very much. for example, even though there are very high levels of bilingualism within the canadian armed forces, army units are still divided up linguistically, with a major regiment in quebec functioning under francophone command. in the air force, by contrast, national integration is unavoidable, and so francophones are simply obliged to learn english. the level of pluralism that is compatible with operational efficacy is very much determined by the amount of interaction that occurs – army bases are much more self-contained than air force squadrons – which is why multinational arrangements are most feasible in cases in which minority groups are geographically concentrated.
&gt;
&gt; one can see cases where the model works less well by considering first nations in canada. there are multiple problems, starting with the fact that less than half of the status indian population lives “on reserve,” while the rest is dispersed across the country, primarily in urban areas. there is no way to meet the needs of the latter group through devolution of political powers. by contrast, it is possible to address a great number of issues on reserves through a strategy of “indigenous self-government,” which is to say, turning reserves into an order of government, with their own jurisdiction and powers. unfortunately, reserves vary enormously in size and geography, which dramatically affects their capacity to provide an institutionally complete society for their members. this in turn makes a uniform devolution of powers impossible. “self-government” means one thing on the kahnawake mohawk reserve, which has a population of over 8,000 and is situated next door to a major metropolitan centre. this reserve has both the means and the capacity to run a primary school system that functions entirely in mohawk. compare that to the red pheasant reserve, population 600, in rural saskatchewan. even if there were the capacity to deliver primary-language cree education, there is practically no economic opportunity on reserve, nor any obvious way of creating it. a self-governing minority nation in this case would refrain from providing members with the skills required for successful integration into the majority culture, but fail to provide a viable alternative set of institutions, that would allow for a comparable level of economic opportunity, political influence and social satisfaction. thus the multinational model of cultural pluralism in this case becomes a recipe for marginalization. it allows members of the group to opt out of majority institutions, which on the one hand relieves them of the burden of having to integrate into a culturally alien set of practices, but on the other hand, denies them access to the not-inconsiderable benefits of these mainstream institutions (in particular, white-collar work in the modern economy). if the institutions of the minority nation are unable to compensate for the loss of those mainstream benefits, the result will be the emergence of significant inequality between members of the minority and majority groups.
&gt;
&gt; ... while the polyethnic model (multiculturalism) is intended to encourage integration into mainstream institutions, by removing all unreasonable impediments to equal participation, the multinational model is intended to allow individuals to opt out of integration without suffering undue cost. in some cases the multinational model even involves some discouragement of integration. indeed, the type of welcoming accommodation that is expected in the polyethnic model is routinely condemned as assimilationism in the multinational model. if too many people from a national minority group defect, by deciding to participate in majority institutions, this makes it more difficult for the minority group to maintain an institutionally complete social structure, and thus to guarantee equal life chances for those who do opt out. so while subsidizing english-language education for immigrants is one of the more enlightened policies of the canadian federal government, if it were to be caught subsidizing english-language education in quebec this would generate a national crisis. instead, the federal government allows quebec to pursue language education policies that in various ways discourage the learning of english.
&gt;
&gt; conflict of this form arose in dramatic fashion in 1969, when the government of canada issued a “white paper” on indian affairs, proposing to abolish the indian act, phase out the reserve system (on the grounds that the policy of “separation” and “different status” “has led to a blind alley of deprivation and frustration”), and to integrate indians into canadian society as “equal” members. this proposal was emphatically rejected by indigenous leaders, not just as bad policy, but as a “betrayal.” the entire episode is now looked back upon as a dark period in crown-indigenous relations, and the white paper is routinely condemned as a template for “cultural genocide.”
&gt;
&gt; the mistake lay in **the federal government having laid out a road map for integration with a population group that instead favoured, and was entitled to demand, self-government**. since that time indigenous policy in canada has remained very much stuck in a bind. many reserves are not economically self-sufficient and have no credible prospect of providing an institutionally complete social environment. yet neither are they able to equip their members with the capabilities required to achieve success in mainstream canadian institutions (the education system, the labour-market, etc.). the government cannot make up for the latter set of deficits too assertively, or pursue the standard set of polyethnic policies to integrate first nations peoples, because that might be seen as encouraging members to live off reserve (and thus as promoting cultural genocide). the results are huge inequalities of opportunity (typically characterized in terms of the “third world” living conditions that prevail on many reserves) which the government then attempts to blunt by intervening in the administration of reserves in ways that are an affront to their sovereignty. the result is a classic stuck file, with self-government, integration and equality standing in relations of mutual antagonism.

in the short term, we need to improve services for first nations - [clean drinking water on reserves](https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/dam/dam-isc-sac/dam-wtr/staging/images-images/water_advisory-infographic-v8_1617978289781_eng.jpg), health care, [policing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-can-this-bc-first-nations-partnership-with-police-offer-a-path-for/).

in the longer term, how do we ensure that the interests of indigenous peoples will be taken into account? e. h. carr observed that the grievances of the few and the weak will never get the same attention as the grievances of the many and the powerful. (to me, a weakness of the us approach to \"anti-racism\" is that it seems to boil down to \"white people should behave better,\" when there's clearly a large number of americans who reject this norm.

in bc, i think a positive long-term development is the supreme court's ruling that [aboriginal land title](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-title) continues to exist, since first nations in bc never signed treaties ceding their lands. it basically means that they're [our landlords](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/yvr-and-musqueam-indian-band-ink-30-year-agreement). this provides the kind of economic foundation that joseph heath describes as lacking.

after all that winnowing down, not being vaccinated means they're only a bit more likely to have covid, not that they're a confirmed carrier. so long as the occasional fraudster makes up less than 1/20 people coming in, there will probably be more vaccinated carriers (95% effective) than unvaccinated. my math on that is probably overly simplified, but the point holds.

with covid, there's probably fewer people selling (because they don't want to move during the pandemic), so once covid ends that may help. but if we end up with permanent changes in where people live, because there's jobs which are no longer tied to living in expensive central cities, i think what we'll need is a widespread home-building boom.

alright, i found the open list wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_list) and couldn't find one for best runner up from a quick google. this speaks to just how many similar options there are for this. it would have been nice if there had been a committee to sift through them all and make a singular recommendation.

&gt; the gallagher index isn't about voting habits but first choice preference votes.

one problem is that we don't know what the first choice preference votes are for our populace. we only have a record of voting habits. for the gallagher index to be absolute we have to assume they are one and the same. that's a big assumption and so we should factor in a big error term into it.

it doesn't do the job of providing for a completely proportional representative parliament. but i don't want that. i still want a local representative. ultimately, i **feel** like there is a contradiction in the goals set out for electoral reform. on the one hand, elected officials must be elected by local constituencies and be accountable to them. on the other, parliament must proportionally represent the entirety of the voting population of canada.

i don't think parliament can proportionally represent canada. individuals are not party members first and canadian citizens second; none of us completely agree with a political party. also, we elect individuals to parliament as representatives, talented and flawed and human, not parties.

the us can conduct operations overseas because they

1) control the oceans. literally all of them.
2) all those conflicts they had the benefit of allies adjacent to the areas they were attacking. they didn't \"invade\" vietnam for instance, they were invited in by the south vietnamese government. so they didn't need to do some nonsense like an amphibious assault and building the transport infrastructure from stratch, they just supplied through the vietnamese ports.

in iraq they could build up an supply through kuwait and saudia arabia. they didn't need to do an amphibious assault on basra to conduct the invasion.

the falkans were a war over a group of tiny islands in the atlantic, so was fought almost entirely with ship based assets. the uk would have had zero ability to invade argentina proper, which would be the relevant comparison to invading canada.

also the arctic isn't an invasion corridor in the slightest. its a giant inhospitable region with no native transport infrastructure. its an absurdly difficult barrier for any force to transverse, not a viable route to the parts of canada that matter.

meanwhile, the bombing your referring to isn't something china or russia has that much capacity to actually do. again, distance defeats their ability to project power that far.

that said, while i know trudeau sr. is widely disliked by the generations before me, my demographic of voters have really only heard about it from our parents. so his name is less of a factor in my experience. even my own parents didn't hold trudeau jr's name against him despite both of them disliking his father. they were both willing to give him a chance (one voted for him/the lib candidate, not sure if the other did) but once he was elected they were open to seeing what he would do. (and then i know the one did not vote for him the second time!)
and as far as the provincial libs go, when i was first learning about our politics, i learned that despite sharing a name, and the same general policies usually, provincial and federal parties are generally completely separate entities, and one should not be judged by the actions of the other. so even the name of the party doesn't factor into it for me. though i'm guessing the average low-information voter doesn't know this, so it probably does play a large factor in their voting habits.


so perhaps mine and my parents philosophy of judging a person/party on their individual actions and not who came before them/their name is rare. but i'd like to think it's becoming more common with newer generations of voters. (it may not be, but if like to think it)

but to your point of \"the reason they can't run a full slate is that nobody want's to be part of a party that can't win.\" that was basically my point when it comes to the vicious cycle. the more they look like they can't win, the harder it's going to get for them. we may disagree on what the highest contributing factor to that is, but the fact is the outcome remains the same regardless.

as u/duck1014 pointed out;

&gt;our recommendations included limiting mobility to truly necessary trips, asking people to avoid close contact with anyone outside of their households, targeting high-risk communities with vaccines and providing immediate support for essential workers in high-risk communities.

on reducing mobility: the entire province is in a stay-at-home order, which reduces mobility. people then complained about lack of enforcement. friday's announcement included enforcement which was summarily rejected. vaccines are being administered as a priority in hot zones and more vaccines will be diverted there. the only thing missing is immediate support for essential workers. all other items in this comment were covered.

the advisory board is trying to go backwards and say well we didn't mean this. it is the equivalent of ford backtracking and say the enforcement was never meant to be random police checks but the public took it how it was presented.

&gt; cooper writes, “for me, one fact underlined the absurdity of b.c.’s systemic problems. fentanyl overdose deaths roughly doubled on the days when addicts received their social assistance. addicts were immediately converting welfare cheques into cash for drug binges— and dying. and in the process, canadian tax dollars were transferred directly into the hands of the big circle boys, who could launder the drug money in casinos and real estate, and transfer funds back to chemical factories in china … in order to produce and import more fentanyl to vancouver, causing more overdose deaths.”

that's a healthcare problem! the problem isn't that these addicts are getting drug money from the government. the problem is that they're addicts and they're not getting help that they need (or perhaps that they're refusing the help that is offered to them).

at the same time, it's also lying about our real estate problem, which is not a result of foreigners. it's a result of poorly-built cities and income &amp; housing inequality driving canadians to empty their wallets for a house that's in the most ideal neighbourhood they can afford, with the best public transit and the shortest commute.",liberals

how about no? no offense, but that subreddit is trash just like r/canada is. i'm as likely to get an accurate picture of quebec from there as i am to get one of canada from that other subreddit.

unfortunately, that place is filled with nationalists too. i've gone there and i'm not impressed. i'd rather talk to real people about quebec rather than the clowns that live in that subreddit.

besides that, nice one skipping over the fact that you were mistaken. yeah, i know french, and i learned it because canada is a bilingual country. despite what you may think, i have no issues with quebec's autonomy, but i will call a spade a spade, and quebec has a nationalism problem whether you want to admit it or not.

that's disappointing too, because i'd rather practice my french with the québécois, but i'm not going to go over there if all i'm going to hear is about \"anglos vs francos\". i really don't care or have time for people's persecution complexes.",liberals

&gt;i’m just not sure paternalism/elitism makes sense as an approach

paternalism can manifest in many different ways. sometimes it can be quite toxic, other times beneficial, and other times benign. 

a law that requires that people wear seatbelts when in a car or a helmet on a bike could be described as somewhat paternalist, as it is the government forcing people to do something which looks out for their well-being. the same can be said about mandatory contributions to a pension plan, as it forces people to contribute to a pension plan. ontario's lcbo &amp; québec's saq could also be described as paternalistic.

one can make a paternalist argument in favour of single-payer health care or universal education, for example.  

some more toxic manifestations of paternalism may be a strong assimilationist policy such as residential schools or ontario's règlement 17. 

humans are fallible, and sometimes those humans take things too far, way to far. that's the case with paternalism too. 

on an aside, if you're interested in reading about paternalism and conservatism, on your journey through wikipedia, look up paternalistic conservatism, classical conservatism, christian democracy, and communitarianism.",liberals

there are certain episodes in canadian history (and moreso american) that are sort of quasi-genocidal; namely things like bounties for killing indians. but what is lacking is any sort of larger, collective genocidal plan or intent. in some respects i think it is difficult to assign the label of genocide to any action before the rise of the modern administrative state; certainly i wouldn't consider something like [the final huron war](https://www.cbc.ca/history/epcontentse1ep2ch5pa5le.html) to be genocide.",conservatives
