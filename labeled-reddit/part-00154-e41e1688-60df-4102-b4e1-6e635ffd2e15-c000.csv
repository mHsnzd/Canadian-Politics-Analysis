this is the crux of the situation that much of the conversation and media coverage around this issue fails to get at, if they even mention the specifics around what zatzman did and paul's lack of reaction at all (which from what i've seen is the primary concern at least in green party groups and discussion online).

had paul repudiated him in any way at any point in this series of events — but especially early on — she could have likely cut off this whole situation at the knees and de-escalated things. people wouldn't have been happy, and obviously there were pre-existing issues in the party and bad dynamics, but it would have no longer been an acute and ever-growing crisis and would have shown some degree of leadership and taking responsibility for the situation on her part, instead of just constantly digging in and lashing out at others in the party, trudeau, freeland, etc. and pretending that what zatzman did was totally fine and no mistakes were made in her reaction to the situation and with accountability about it within the party.

i don't know that i'd call kenney 'corrupt'. slimey, sure, machevellian perhaps. he certainly uses rhetoric to try to get the crowd worked up so to speak. but it's not like he's using his power to get court cases thrown out for his friends or taking brown envelopes of cash under the table for being awarded gov't contracts or the like which we saw with the federal libs.

here's the question i wanted to hear from journalists: maybe trudeau is pm in 2030, maybe he isn't. probably he isn't. but by 2025 at least you think we should be at least a third or halfway to the mark. **what are the consequences if we aren't?** i want journalists to press politicians to put something on the line. stake something so that we can at least pretend they give a shit. if trudeau were to promise that if, say, canada doesn't at least hit 30% reductions by 2030 that he would donate half his wealth, that would be a more credible climate promise than anything a canadian politician has produced.

they do it because it works. maybe not on me and you, but on most people. and if one party stops doing it, they put themselves at a massive electoral disadvantage because if people are pointing out their \"scandals\" without them firing back and highlighting the opposition \"scandals\", then they will appear dirty and corrupt while the opposition looks squeaky clean. instead, we have everyone looking dirty whether they deserve it or not, which contributes to the \"both sides\" whataboutism nonsense that we see so much.

i have literally been trolled by liberal staffers as a gay man for advocating conservative policies that i agreed with and for identifying with the party.

i have strong opinions of parties that encourage its staff to harass 2slgbtq+ canadians as ‘traitors’ merely because we vote or think differently. furthermore, while i support a wider social-safety net and apparatus of public institutions, liberal public spending in the past has not always served taxpayer and non-partisan interests as it ought to have.

i’m not convinced that the liberals didn’t have corporate interests in mind in the ship procurement scandal, when they went after vice-admiral mark norman for whistle-blowing.

nor do i believe that the liberal party had equity  in mind during the snc-lavalin affair, or its use of the prime ministerial ‘bully pulpit’ to intimidate critics of quebec’s bill 21.

and yes- i’m just as outraged at the o’toole’s outspoken acceptance of bill 21 as well.

you are correct that your conservative neighbours have a comical understanding of themselves, canada, and the world but i would warn you to be reflexive here:

if the limits of your imagination defines as acceptable, a minority-liberal government propped by the cpc, then your vision too remains all too obscured by partisan identifications.

the **downvoting** only emphasizes my point. i’m happy to criticize my party. i don’t hold partisanship holier than any attempt to understand the world for what it is.",liberals

and then mass waves of immigration from asia began in the 1990s, and then the darling liberal minority became non-christian asians, primarily south asian. and then 9/11 happened, and now it became muslim refugees. and then the rise of *social justice*, and then the darling liberal minority became lgbt people. and then donald trump got elected and the darling liberal minority became blacks.

as the darling liberal minority changed over the decades, the original catholic european liberal voting base were being told they were not going to get funding for being anti-abortion, there are threats to de-fund publicly funded catholic schools, catholic churches are being burned, and european culture is *evil* colonialism. 

and so the cycle continues.

the only thing constant with the liberals is that their perpetual enemy are the wasp (white anglo-saxon protestant), hence their original support for french-canadians (they've abandoned, they now vote for caq or bloc quebecois), then for catholics (which they've completely abandoned), then now the new charade is guilt-tripping white people.

liberals have strayed so far away from their original voting base that they're the biggest hypocrites in canadian history. it's amazing how they're able to pull it off.",liberals

we've come to a point where the vast majority of people think that if they can't afford a thing they want, they shouldn't have to save up or maybe just not get every single thing they want. instead the government should go bankrupt printing money to give it to them for free. to even have a chance of winning the last election, even the conservatives had to run on a platform of \"slightly less free stuff.\" there isn't a single party in canada interested in fiscal responsibility because there isn't a winning number of canadians who are willing to give up, or even delay getting, some things in the name of fiscal responsibility.",conservatives

on the other hand - he's got a very very serious trust issue going on in the party. he ran as 'true blue' for the leadership and then did something very different in the campaign. he ran as no carbon tax and then still brought in something that looked an aweful lot like a carbon tax even tho it was technically sort of different.  he promised to stand with gun owners and through them up under the bus in a heart beat in such a painfully stupid way that it basically cost him the election.

explaining that to voters shouldn't be terribly difficult, especially since immigrants, who everyday make up a larger share of the electorate, tend to be more socially conservative than the average white canadian. 

abortion policy could go something like:
no sex selective abortions, no late term abortions (x cut off date) no public funding for abortions i.e. your body your choice your wallet. and use that as a bridge to go into your more private healthcare platform. 

but no. instead we get this embracement of abortion as a sacrament that further empowers the left in their moral crusade and demoralizes and pisses off true conservatives.

compared to other developed countries (that we trade the most with), we are relatively irrelevant and replaceable. (no innovative tech is from here anymore, or at least rarely).

compared to developing countries, we do not have an economic advantage. (no industry and we export primarily resources to them).

hj2ff4i,2021-11-02T07:53:26.000-07:00,"trudeau calls for global carbon tax at cop26 summit the economic impact of not joining would be bigger than the impact of a carbon rate.

if a carbon rate of $100 slows gdp growth by 5% and effectively tarrifs from the 1st world slows it down 10%, it is a no brainer.

i think you're misunderstanding how this would be implemented. nations like canada and eu members will have an internal carbon rate, and they will correct imports and imports for estimated carbon use when trading with nations that don't have one. the end result is likely a small tariff on physical goods from non participating nations.

here is the trick though, carbon efficient countries will want to join because in a world of carbon taxes, the more efficient nations gain a competitive advantage. that's why japan and the eu would want to join such a pact. they stand to make huge sums of money.

now smaller nations that rely on trade to these nations will also want to join because they can beat the default tarriff rates, and because the earlier they join, the bigger the first mover advantage they get over other smaller nations. and after they've joined.... they'll improve efficiency, and suddenly want to push it more.

the us might join with a dem government on environmental reasons or for redistribution reasons, or they might join under the gop because it suits their america first shtick.

the hard part is to get enough mass to get the ball rolling. canada + eu + japan + sk would potentially be enough mass.

will this chill international trade? yes. not a ton, but of course it will. that's kinda part of the goal. shipping tomatoes from south africa to northern ontario is an insane amount of co2. a co2 efficient planet would discourage that. local production gets a significant advantage if co2 is priced in. that's just the reality of shipping.


(as for poor countries, they already get fucked by international trade deals. they don't have much of a say either way. personally, i would offer this and in exchange lower barriers to trade ... which i think we should do anyway, so it is win-win)",liberals

article content

&gt;about 90 per cent of the people ottawa has flown from afghanistan are canadian citizens and permanent residents of afghan descent, estimates dave fraser, a retired army general with the group veterans transition network.

it is a shame that political concerns overtook the real human concerns in afghanistan. i'll be honest - i am one of the majority of canadians who basically forgot about it since like 2015. i can't pretend to know what we should have done or know what went wrong there. i am not an expert or even a particularly knowledgeable person on it.

but one thing i do know is that we owe an obligation to the thousands of people who helped us, and will likely now suffer for us, and that was owed once it became clear that afghanistan was going to fall to the taliban again. i think that's what we expected in early august.

trudeau and i are apparently in agreement on this one since he promised he would help 20,000 afghans get to canada a mere 12 days ago. yet today, with the deadline approaching and weeks worth of stories about [how canadians aren't able to do anything on the ground](https://theline.substack.com/p/kevin-newman-the-people-we-left-behind), we are facing what most people suspected would happen when an election was called as afghanistan fell: an embarrassing and hurtful failure.

the most evocative thing trudeau (and all parties have done) is say he wouldn't recognize the taliban government. that must be so helpful for afghans. but it is an election cycle, and politicians have to say the good things to get the votes. 

then again, maybe afghans understand why our democracy might be worth more than their lives. for the last two decades, we or our allies have demanded a pound of flesh in exchange for it in most parts of the world. maybe this wasn't unexpected at all.",liberals

either there's a better alternative or there isn't. if there isn't, why do you want a handful of disastrous parties with leaders grabbing on to anything they can to save their own skin having input on legislation?

the cpc isn't just having a bad year or poor crop of leadership candidates, this is who they are. the ndp is a reasonable alternative in my eyes, you either like them or you don't but they aren't going to be a significantly different party if we don't have an election for 2 more years.

although i agree there's a huge degree of opportunism in calling an election, i do think the idea of holding an election to ask for a mandate to do all these things that weren't on the table in the last election makes perfect sense. a lot of difficult decisions are coming up, and the last thing whoever is making those decisions needs is cynical sniping from the back row that canadians didn't ask for this.",liberals

&gt; they also need to “anti-identity politics” identity politics as a wedge issue to motive their base. open and nuanced inclusion makes that more difficult. the marginalized people that succeed in or the ones welcomed into conservative parties tend to be the ones that leave their identities at home, oppose equity, and assimilate into mainstream white, heteronormative anglophone society

this depends on how power is built. when minority groups hold power as voting blocs, it's a lot less likely that elected politicians have to assimilate. someone from a racial minority group will behave differently (regardless of political party) when getting elected in a place that's 90% white as opposed to places in the gta that are &lt;50% white. 

&gt; and then of course there are the social conservatives that aggressively oppose inclusion and equity at all points. the social conservatives are the most vocal and active conservatives members and they have significant influence because of that.

they're an albatross not just on the cpc, but canada as a whole. progress in the cpc (like any other major party) i think is progress for this nation. while there are partisans that are pleased that an aggrieved, out of touch cpc is easier to beat, it's better for the country as a whole when all of our parties share common values, and truly fight for the interests of everyone.",conservatives

i extracted the data from here: [https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a3](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a3)

and the average proportion of fully vaccinated canadians over the period from the week ending on december 19th and the week ending on june 26th is just 3.85%. meaning even if vaccines gave no protection at all and the fully vaccinated were as likely as anyone else to develop covid, and we had the same amount of cases every week over the period, we'd expect the fully vaccinated over that period to represent less than 4% of all cases.

if i balance out for the number of cases per week, then the expected proportion of cases in fully vaccinated people if vaccines gave no protection at all would be 2.5%.

less than 0.5% is 5 times less than that, so it's good, but this data is extremely, extremely misleading.

on another level, it's also not obvious that a party needs credibility to win.  if the cpc intends to win victory through attacking the liberals rather than inspiring in their own right, then even bad attacks might be a net positive by engendering a vague feeling that something's wrong/incompetent/corrupt about the current government.
