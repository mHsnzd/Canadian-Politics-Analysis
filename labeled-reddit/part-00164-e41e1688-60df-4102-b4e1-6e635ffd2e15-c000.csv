the créditistes in québec were an unusual movement that doesn't really have an equivalent today.  they were extremely catholic and very socially conservative, but economically left-wing in a lot of ways.   they were very supportive of things like high capital gains taxes, large-scale wealth redistribution, and i believe they proposed nationalizing the banks at one point. 

the quiet revolution is really what killed them.  interestingly, most of the places that used to be very safe créditiste ridings became very safe ridings for the bloc québecois, and mostly voted in favor of separation in the 1995 referendum (e.g. saguenay, jonquière, témiscamingue, rimouski).  

the main exception to that rule i know of is beauce, which used to be a créditiste stronghold and...well, i'm sure you know its recent history.",conservatives

hfck52c,2021-10-03T23:32:11.000-07:00,"tofino trip may only hasten trudeau’s departure there were plenty of gta ridings won by less than 5%, against the cpc and a couple of toronto ridings won by less than 5% against the ndp. the gta isn’t safe liberal territory, it’s the most swingy region in the entitle country. you know nothing about the gta if you think it’s safe liberal territory and any other liberal would “win the gta anyway”. not to mention that trudeau isn’t just popular in the gta, he’s popular in every single major urban area outside of ab/sk. 



let’s take a look at the list of cities where the liberals won the most votes and seats: ottawa, toronto, all the gta cities, vancouver, all the metro vancouver cities, kingston, guelph, cambridge, kitchener, waterloo, london, niagara/st catherine’s, montreal, laval, brossard, gatineau/hull/aylmer, sherbrooke, halifax, fredericton, st johns and winnipeg. and that’s just off the top of my head. 



the liberals also managed to win seats in calgary and edmonton, which is significant because the last time the liberals won seats in calgary besides 2015, was in the 1960s under pierre elliot trudeau. they also tied the seat count in conservative quebec city with the cpc. 




trudeau and the liberals are just so strong in practically all of canada’s urban areas, not just the gta as you claim. plus, he was literally 11 seats away from a majority. if he gained around 16k more votes in a few select ridings, he’d have a majority right now. so all it would have taken is a small increase in their national support to flip those ridings. the party isn’t going to force out such an electorally powerful, very appealing leader who won 3 elections in a row. it’s such a ridiculous claim to begin with.",liberals

again, your ignorance is not an argument. we have multiple german elections, showing that the pr component yeilds far more representation to the far right neo-nazi party the afd, in multiple election cycle, than fptp.   
as i said, the conclusion is data driven. 

&gt;  
bernier barely lost leadership of the cpc. this very same political movement of crazies could have very well co-opted the conservative party instead. the risks are going to be there regardless, in both canada and abroad.

which is why i prefer the system that minimises the risk than magnifies the risk 

&gt;how does one maintain a government that \"serves the people\" if the power of said government is not made contingent on public will? the political stagnation of flawed democracies leads to unaccountable governance, just as the static nature of autocracies often lead to oppressive governance.

simple - serving the people is a matter of results. not a matter of ideology. this is why the king of dubai is serving the people better than democratically elected hitler 

&gt;i think the biggest ideological fanatic here is you, just without you being aware of it whatsoever.

yeah that is why the so-called ideological fanatic is saying ' system which gives more power to nazis is worse', while the so-called not fanatic is saying ' ignore the results, just think on the theory of what is more representative',makes a lotta sense indeed.",conservatives

&gt; when paul spoke about her own experiences with this while leading the greens, former leader jim harris told ctv: “when she doesn’t get her way, she calls racism. now racism, sexism, and violent metaphors like ‘walking over shards of glass’ and ‘spitting up blood’ get headlines, but what we have to judge a leader by is their performance and annamie’s performance as leader has resulted in the green party’s worst performance in 20 years.”
&gt; 
&gt; what a breathlessly tone-deaf display of privilege, ignorance and convenient blindness. while there is little doubt paul’s tenure as leader was objectively really bad, jim harris is someone who, i wager, has zero personal lived experience of what it is to be attacked for his gender or his race. until last month he was largely forgotten, cast among other unsuccessful green leaders, emerging only from irrelevance to remind us all what an absolute drag it can be for women — especially minority women — who dare to take up a little more oxygen, a little more space in the public realm. it made me want to gag.

goodness. if a party which i previously led was being actively destroyed by an incompetent and plausibly malicious leader, i certainly would take the time to speak up. likewise, mulroney (who's led a pretty quiet life post-pm days) has spoken up about recent issues in the conservatives. it's important for former leaders to speak up. 

yet this writer takes paul at her word. yet repeatedly paul's announcements and claims have been shown to be chock full of misdirection and deceit. let us not forget when paul held an announcement, when she cried \"racism!\" and \"misogyny!\" over the letter circulated among the greens' federal council. she used weasel words to imply that manly and may shared that judgement -- while the two of them were gagged under her orders -- [which was later demonstrated to not be may's opinion in her toronto star editorial.](https://www.thestar.com/politics/political-opinion/2021/10/03/annamie-paul-told-me-to-stay-silent-but-now-i-must-say-something.html)  (the editorial also alluded to the fact that may did not personally believe that letter to be either racist or misogynistic.)

and then paul went on cbc's the national for an interview, following [the leak of the letter](https://web.archive.org/web/20210616222033/https://old.reddit.com/r/greenpartyofcanada/comments/o1h7up/leaked_letter_from_federal_councillors_attacking/) and *refused* to answer any questions about the actual contents of the letter or to explain in what way it was \"racist\" or \"misogynist\".  

if she had ever actually been subject to actual *racism and misogyny* from the federal council, without a doubt would have hauled out that evidence in front of the cameras for all to see. yet she's never produced a shred of proof. 

if anything, i imagine that members of the green's federal council have been walking on egg shells trying to avoid doing or saying anything which could be perceived as racist (or misogynist) given her demonstrated temperament.

[same story with allegations of online threats.](https://www.sudbury.com/local-news/green-party-leader-is-concerned-after-receiving-threats-online-4259342) there was never any substantiation of her allegations. did she not know how to do a screenshot? [she claimed](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-green-leader-annamie-paul-points-out-online-threats-calls-for/): 

&gt; “recently there was an entire facebook thread, on a public group, proposing that someone come and assault me at one of my events,” she said in the statement.

and the media breathlessly regurgitated it without any critical analysis or fact checking. it's as if they live in fear of casting doubt on her assertions. it would have been to her benefit if they were able to write, \"... which the globe and mail has seen and verified.\"

she is a person whose statements should have a complete lack of credibility in everyone's eyes. she conned the media into reporting her resignation twice now. 

- september 27: [annamie paul resigns as green party leader](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/annamie-paul-resigns-as-green-party-leader-1.5601820)

- november 10: [annamie paul officially resigns as green party leader, ends membership](https://globalnews.ca/news/8364604/annamie-paul-green-party-resigns/)

as far as anyone can tell that letter wasn't really a resignation, but rather an attempt to stay on as leader two weeks *beyond* the leadership vote by effectively demanding two additional weeks pay. it was also likely a means to sabotage the leadership review process and dissuade people from voting against her, thinking that she was already gone, thereby improving her numbers.",conservatives

not really in favour of this \"change of tone\" suggestion.  it doesn't really address the fundamental differences that exist within the cpc.  rather it attempts to hide or mask them, to create a facade.

well it's kind of silly calling them 'endless'.  most  of them are ending.  and it's because they see they're right on the edge of the pandemic overwhelming their medical systems and leading to huge numbers of casualties, as we saw in italy. what else are you going to do? the only other effective way to address it is vaccinations and they couldn't give what they didn't have (thanks trudeau). now that they do and the vaccines are rolling out the outbreaks are starting to get under control and once they are the lockdowns will end.  but - it's not against conservative ideology to not let thousands die needlessly. 

&gt;i think it's because a lot of canadians are actually kind of passive   
aggressive whiners who tend to view the idea of individual freedom with   
some skepticism.

you realize you're whining passively aggressively right now? and while that might be one way to prove your point i think we both know that's not the case :)

most canadians realize that the infringement on their right to mobility etc is greatly overshadowed by other canadians right to life. it is frequent that two people's rights butt up against each other, and when that happens what we do is try to pick the solution where the lowest amount of infringement takes place. being locked down for a few weeks is pretty small potatoes compared to being dead forever. 

i mean seriously - if the country were being invaded by a foreign power and we were all at risk you wouldn't be whining about how 'unconservative' it would be to have martial law or the like, right? this is a very existential threat to the nation and it's people, so we do what we gotta do. 

&gt;i hear a ton of people are dying!! and now is not the time for fun, but what do i know?

at the best of times people are pretty darn apathetic; i'm not surprised those who don't normally care about politics care even last right now. there are so many other things going on in people's lives that they are concerned about.

the fact they should be concerned  about the state of the country and those in power is something else entirely. but again, we're generally selfish and tend to not care until something affects us personally.

&gt; the actual number is not 80%

however as you provided absolutely no backup for your assertion you seem to be basing that on your gut feel, which is much less accurate than polling. even asking 10 random people is more accurate than gut feel (but wow, those error bars!). math doesn't care about your feelings.

1500 **is** an adequate size given the error bars they were reporting. that's how the math works. if you disagree, perhaps you can provide the links to the research that says otherwise? the fewer people, the larger the error. or would you argue against the mathematicians/statisticians on that one? is *every* polling firm wrong, cause every one of them had similar sample sizes... tell you what; i am going to trust them on the numbers required since they have put in the years of studying over your baseless assertions unless you can provide some solid contrary evidence (and then i suggest you call up the pollsters and let them know how wrong they are in their methodology, as i suspect they would like to know that they have had it wrong for all these years -- you are gonna be famous!).

it is always easy to poo-poo the questions, sample, etc. while not providing anything of value in the argument. i spent significant time providing a wealth of information, perhaps you can do the same. the polls i link provide that information and much, much more; can you explain to me where they went wrong in your opinion? i supplied 6 individual polls, 5 of which reported numbers greater than 75%. each of these polls list how they were performed; each provides their own error bars.

on to your points:

&gt; polling for elections is much easier to judged based on sample sizes this size.

somewhat confusing; i assume this is to be read in conjunction with the next line...

&gt; there are a multitude of answers besides for or against.

name some. for example, here is a question from one of the polls (which incidentally, was just on vaccine mandates so there was no leading of other questions):

* do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the following: mandatory vaccinations for canadians who can be vaccinated to help control the spread of new covid-19 variants.

here's one from the nanos survey, which was an election survey (so the 1500 people surveyed pass your muster for political polling, at least). that being said, there was no political affiliation associated with the question about vaccine mandates.

* do you support or oppose the following: mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers.

and they provide the same 4 options as the one above: support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose 

what do you feel was missing?

incidentally; nanos found almost 80% support of conservatives for the above mandate question, so it seems that support for the mandate is not necessarily determined by political affiliation.

&gt; it was likely that people were lead to answers based on the circumstances of the survey.

that's complete conjecture, and sad considering the polls i have provided show you the very questions that were asked and you could read them yourself and make a proper argument as to why the questions would have skewed the results; but instead you just made up something that allowed you to discount a result you don't like.

considering every poll i found indicated a vast majority of canadians support a vaccine mandate, i think we shall have to go with that unless you can provide some actual data instead of conjecture and guesswork, which, i am sure you can agree, has absolutely no merit mathematically or scientifically and has no place in a discussion such as this.",conservatives
