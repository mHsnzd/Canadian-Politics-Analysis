i mean they can't be arrested or detained for civil matters only criminal ones. so it's not like there's an easy way to prevent their free movement in some ways already. 

it's way outside my actual knowledge of how the constitution might apply since it's so novel i have no research to do or knowledge of the past. 

this would likely need to be cleared by some smart constitutional thinkers before being presented in the house, and frankly they'd need non partisan support.  the cpc closing ranks on it won't look good to most folks i think but if they do and it passes it can be seen as a partisan political play in deep conservative parts of the country, and that would politicize vaccines even more.

though i don't think the argument trudeau politicized vaccines really holds water - if every party leader has acknowledged their importance (short of bernier ofc), then making it political is the work of imo the cpc mostly because they're saying one thing but doing another. 

i can understand the \"we will respect the choices and private health decisions of our caucus\" as far as not outing individuals from the centre but they should let people self report their vaccine status and work to get everyone in caucus vaccinated.

it's one thing to say you respect the individual choices it's another to shelter them from consequences. but otooles leadership is under risk atm so idk if he'd go that far. unless he sees the writing on the wall. in that case i hope he goes full out and just does what he can to entrench at least some* short term changes that take the partisanship out of covid again for the time being.",liberals

what is a *need*? it's been four years?

there was no need unless you consider that politicians *need* to win elections because it is one of the largest parts of their jobs. the covid response was wildly popular and the liberals were polling at the highest they had been in years. this was likely to be their best chance to win a new mandate. if they had waited until covid was a distant memory, polling might have turned on them and they might not have been able to pick their engagement.

most minority governments last less than two years. if the liberals had waited until their polling dropped, opposition parties would have brought the government down, also for no reason other than *want*.

obviously it's looking like they miscalculated, but i don't think that changes anything about *need* vs *want*.",liberals

&gt;during the fall of 2020, younger people became more heavily affected by excess deaths, as 35% of these deaths involved individuals under the age of 65, up from 14% in the spring.

&gt;the number of deaths was 24% higher than expected for men aged under 45, followed by women aged 45 to 64, who recorded 14% more deaths than expected. by comparison, there were 6% more deaths than expected among those aged 85 and older during the fall period.

&gt;as these shifts imply an increase in deaths not directly caused by covid-19, it is important to note that some deaths may be due to the indirect consequences of the pandemic, which could include increases in mortality due to overdoses. for example, in british columbia, the chief coroner's office has reported increases in deaths due to overdoses since the start of the pandemic. similarly, alberta health services reported decreases in both the provision and use of substance use treatment programs as well as increases in opioid-related emergency responses and deaths since the onset of the pandemic. overdose deaths disproportionately affect younger men. for example, according to a report by alberta health, between january 1 and june 30, 2020, 79% of apparent unintentional fentanyl overdoses were among men, with those aged 25 to 39 recording the highest proportions of such deaths.",conservatives

&gt;après cet échange par courriel : silence radio.

ça semble bien être la tendance avec paul. silence radio partout. 

&gt;l’écologiste a conclu qu’il n’était pas le bienvenu.

tout parti devrait rester ouvert aux candidatures de ceux qui ont déjà porté d'autres couleurs politiques. surtout les verts qui forment une coalition d'orphelins politiques et de gens déçus de leurs anciennes formations politiques. 

mais tout parti aspirant à gouverner le canada se doit cependant de s'assurer que leurs candidats acceptent de tenir la ligne fédéraliste. c'est-à-dire soit avoir véritablement la conviction fédéraliste ou au minimum se taire sur la question nationale pour se concentrer sur d'autres enjeux. 

en ce sens, si pierre nantel a pu siéger au sein du ndp et réjan hébert se présenter pour les libéraux, je vois pas pourquoi simard pourrait pas s'essayer avec les verts. tout de même, une future députation québécoise du pvc devrait être naturellement majoritairement fédéraliste, tout comme celle du bloc est souverainiste. le contraire n'aurait aucun sens. 

&gt;les verts ont réussi à attirer plus de membres québécois...représentent maintenant 10 %... beaucoup grincent des dents devant le manque de sensibilité de la cheffe pour les enjeux qui touchent la province, indique une autre source interne.

oui, moi même je l'ai constaté. et c'est pas juste un phénomène d'aveuglement vis à vis le québec, c'est un aveuglement envers...carrément tout ce qui se passe en dehors de son entourage politique proche. si auparavant le parti était un mélange désorganisé de différents enracinement locaux, sous paul il est rendu une dictature élitiste. les enjeux locaux et organisations locales sont ignorés. 

&gt;contre la motion du bloc québécois visant à faire reconnaître que le québec peut changer seul sa section de la constitution.

c'est ça qui arrive quand on n'écoute pas ses membres et qu'on gère tout du bureau de toronto. 

&gt;craindrait qu’appuyer le québec nuise aux chances de son parti...en particulier à toronto

lol, c'est vraiment trop drôle. comme si l'électeur moyen pensera aux questions constitutionnelles des autres provinces en votant. paul ne semble pas connecter avec les enjeux prioritaires des gens.

pour renchérir sur les décisions de paul, de sa déconnection avec les membres et organisations:

fwiw: easiest counter to this argument - there are small towns with no population growth that saw a spike in house prices across canada. this happens when money is too loose and people are encouraged to take out a mortgage and the government promising they won’t let prices ever come down.

edit: bring on the downvotes! if you aren’t willing to understand how the two largest price run ups occurred under trudeau, and how every single community/province/etc. has a different excuse to why their worthless tear down in the middle of no where is worth half a million or more… then don’t comment. i’m like house and prefer simple explanations. only 1 constant is between these 2 price run ups - trudeau! i recommend princes of the yen (documentary and book) on the matter.

&gt;they were willing to overlook his crudeness because biden would ruin the country.

they're partisan republicans. you don't need to attempt to make up reasons here, they voted republican because that's what they do. how could you attempt to start a conversation about partisanship and then ignore it as the obvious answer to your own scenario? 

&gt;see here 38% of republicans disapprove of trump’s conduct but support him anyway. 

and that means absolutely nothing in this context.

think of it this way: as the only currently viable right-wing party in canada the cpc courts economic conservatives and social conservatives alike. there is definitely some crossover so some people do belong in both groups, but if would be folly to say that they're the same political demographic just because they're voting together right now. this is because it is *very* easy to see the differences of their driving political beliefs.

 in your case \"maga\" is synonymous with the hardcore trump supporters while \"traditional republicans\" are a seperate group. they voted together but that does not mean they're the same. you can look at any republican primary to see the competing factions within it by the way. for this reason the 38% disapproval doesn't refute this but actually supports it.

most conservative and ndp partisans are less enthusiastic because the polls suggest they won't make gains. some people are sincerely opposed due to covid but with 70% of the population vaccinated and distancing protocols having proved effective, that line of argument is mostly being carried by partisans reading the tea leaves.

hh91n46,2021-10-19T02:41:18.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] &gt;well, it certainly wasnt a controversial opinion in this subreddit(and elsewhere) back a few years ago when harper won a majority with only 39.62% of the vote, with the popular vote by a wide margin.


glad we have your knowledge because i don't know if anyone could tell if this is true or not


but, we can look at this a little closer for sake of argument. total vote share, ie popular vote is great and all, but regional context is incredibly important, and harper actually had some pretty broad spectrum pan-canadian support to win by most overall votes, ie *popular vote*. what popular vote doesn't tell you is a) where votes are located, b) how votes are being split between other parties for diminished returns, and c) is that translated into seats.

~40% of overall vote to win a majority is very important, but as many will point out that's not a majority share of 50+, which in democracy is a bit of target fixation to demand that.

like i stated, harper's time as pm had some stronger seats spread across canada, not perfectly so but we get what we get, so a popular vote win is nice to show he had strong cross-country support. the issue many had with that majority win, or really the ones who complained the most, was the fact 60% voted for another party. so to claim a win by popular support is not a good metric because the most-est votes-est isn't really accurate over the denominator, hence 40% for a majority instead of needing 50%. it's why trudeau has the largest seat share because regional riding context matters as well.

the cpc has had the most-est votes-est, but over two elections much of that share is concentrated in fewer ridings. it doesn't mean people don't vote for them in other ridings, but that getting the most votes is great and all when it is 16000 (cpc win) -6000 (all other candidates) that inflates numbers overall, but locally wins their riding, versus a riding of 9000 (lpc) - 8000 (cpc) - 7000 (all others). here arguably the non-cpc is not a popular support, and even more neither is the aggregate against the liberal. but it wins that riding. that's what many claim as a party's voter efficiency in that votes are spread out across enough ridings to get more seats.

it's why popular support is a very poor metric in canada because it translates to a meaningless result unless it has a multi-regional foundation. even though alberta, saskatchewan, and parts of manitoba contribute to half of the conservative support, that only wins them a limited number of ridings in 3/10 provinces. it's why popular support number inflation is being exposed in a parliamentary democracy. it doesn't mean much. and as was pointed out with harper, and again with trudeau now, that number doesn't mean much when the aggregate of voted **not** for the winning party will always be higher.

**tl;dr** *popular vote is meaningless because we don't work in a cross-country vote share system. there is over 300 individual little ridings where it matters, and most don't win over 50%*

also no one knows what was said 7-10 years ago on this subreddit. a glossing statement to become the innocent victim isn't a way to win arguments then or now, so i'm discounting that as a fair argument since it is not discernable outside of subjective feelings and faint memory at this point",liberals

he cut taxes and increased spending, then brought in the gst to try to stem the bleeding. the record deficits at the tail end of mulroney/campbell beginning of the chretien years were in the vicinity of $70b/year in today's money, and that was piled on top of the debt run up by trudeau sr. 

chretien/martin did reign in spending, a fair bit of which came out of transfers, and getting the benefits of mulroney's gst. they managed year after year of surpluses.

harper cut taxes in a roaring economy, largely eliminating martin's surpluses, which instantly became deficits when the financial crisis hit. he killed the safety buffer and poured gasoline on an already overheated economy. he only managed one tiny surplus in his final year by implementing unsustainable cuts and one time sales of assets.

i never said i supported hybrids- in fact, elsewhere in this thread i criticized the prius as a half measure. i’m completely battery electric.

there’s nothing stopping people from building charging infrastructure in the rural regions.

doesn’t change the fact that lower class people can’t afford good evs without subsidies. 

even running off of fossil fuel electricity, there are still fewer emissions. the math has been done on that over and over again. that point also ignores the fact that we need to get off of fossil fuels as a power source and clean up the grid in a transition to nuclear, wind, and solar, which will further benefit evs.

again, infrastructure isn’t actually something that is static, it moves with demand. how many chargers do you think there were in 2008 exactly? i’m in edmonton. how many chargers do you think we had in 2012? spoiler alert, that number is not the same.

secondly:
 
&gt; new democrats in the toronto riding of spadina-fort york suggest the ndp commit to phasing out the canadian armed forces because “militaries and war have devastatingly negative impacts on civilian populations,” and that, once the phaseout is done, personnel receive full salaries and benefits pending their assignments to “new jobs in the civil service.”

thirdly:

&gt; in a statement, mr. singh described the convention as an occasion for the ndp riding associations and their members to advance resolutions and engage in the democratic process.

&gt; “our conventions are guided by a democratic process that allows members to openly and freely discuss and vote on a variety of issues,” he said.

so it wasn't as simple as 'abolish the military'. it proposed transitioning the service people to civilian/civil service roles (re-training and pay/benefits provided). and regardless, it got voted down. basically any member can make proposals that are voted on. so you're bound to get some more wildcard stuff proposed, which can be good or bad depending on who you ask and the proposal in question.",liberals

trudeau's response to the pandemic was good, and he seems to be letting quebec be in the whole secularism debate, and so people don't see a reason to vote against him. people don't have a problem with the bloc, they just don't see a reason to cast a protest vote at the moment.

it will be argued that with proper precautions (masks, social distancing) both campaigning and voting can be done safely.

it will probably be justified that the minority status is a hinderance to properly responding to the pandemic and the economic consequences it has caused. that the other parties are slowing things down, with their demands of having a say in what should be done so as to attain a majority of votes in parliament, and in their distracting partisan \"attacks\" by demanding things like inconvenient ethics probes and such when obviously there are obviously more important things than ethics to worry about.

this isn't about keeping people i disagree with me out. i don't like anyone but the liberals right now, but there 4 other parties with seats in parliament. this is about keeping the loonies out. fptp pushes the major parties towards the mainstream positions which is good a thing. 

maybe the ppc will breakthrough into riding or two in the future, or maybe there will be the odd crazy mp from any of the big parties to go off the rails. but that is far different from 20 or 30 lunatic anti-vaxxers qanon supporting mps yelling and screaming at every qp and committee meeting.

hevchyd,2021-09-30T02:55:45.000-07:00,"max bernier and the folly of electoral reform &gt;invariably, virtually all the calls come from left-wing ndp and green party supporters, who are convinced our first-past-the-post system is outdated and “unfair” because it doesn’t reflect their true share of public support. 

what?  the entire reason anyone is talking about electoral reform in this country is because of the liberal party of canada's campaign platform in 2015 to end fptp.  how disingenuous of the author to suggest it is only the ndp and green party who want to end it.

and we don't want to end it because it's \"unfair\" or because our party can't get elected.  we want to end it because it's dangerous, and destructive for our government and country.  as our politics devolves into a two party system, where voters are forced to \"hold their nose\" to vote for the big tent party that they don't really like, to defeat the other big tent party that they hate, corruption, crony capitalism, and inefficient government run rampant.  

we need electoral reform so that our politicians are afraid of us again, so that they create a government that benefits us, not the rich corporations that donate to their re-election campaigns.  

&gt;but what a difference an election makes!


&gt;suddenly, except for diehard pr purists, left-wing backers of electoral reform are surprisingly mute. 

no we're not.  we still want pr.  the stv system proposed by our electoral reform committee and stephane dion set a threshold of 17% in each riding, which would have kept fringe parties like ppc out.

these kinds of opinion articles that come from the star always read like they were written by friends of the liberal party.  it's no surprise why so many of my peers have stopped reading the star.

i'll just add a couple of interesting facts.  

- 1 - the liberal party of canada uses a form of proportional representation very much like stv to elect their own party leaders: https://www.huffpost.com/archive/ca/entry/justin-trudeau-liberal-leadership_n_3081393

&gt;the results were weighted to give each of the country's 308 ridings equal clout. each riding was assigned 100 points, which were allotted proportional to each contenders' share of the vote in each riding.

seems odd for trudeau to reject pr when it worked so well to get him nominated as party leader.

- 2 - more than 50% of voters from every party want proportional representation:
