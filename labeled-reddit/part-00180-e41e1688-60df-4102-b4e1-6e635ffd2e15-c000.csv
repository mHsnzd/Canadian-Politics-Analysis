politicians are transactional. trudeau and kenney are acting in the best interests of themselves, their bases, and their constituencies, in that order.

where i think things have gotten out of whack is that those interests are in conflict, which is really disappointing. look at our geography. there is no way alberta or quebec survive outside of confederation, and no way the confederation survives without both of them.

alberta is not the oil and gas industry, and alberta's leaders really do albertans a disservice in representing alberta that way. they do need better access to international markets, not just for oil and gas, but for everything. you can't ship grain through a pipeline.

quebec is not anti-canada or anti-alberta. they have thier own issues and hang ups, just like alberta does, and unfortunately thier insistence on doing everything differently means it's much harder for them to adopt best practices from other provinces.

i actually think canada has a much bigger issue with the urban-rural divide. the lifestyles and expectations are completely different. nobody who chooses to live in the country wants all the amenities and services of a big city. but they don't want to live in the 1920s either. all of canada's provinces are dealing with the social and fiscal issues that arise from this.",liberals

true. but when information is free for all, it can be discussed by all. bad ideas can be challenged openly. in all of history there will always be people selling bad ideas that people are willing to buy. by labelling something as misinformation and trying to make it disappear, you may embolden people as it appears as 'suppression' or may even be trying to make things that are actually factual disappear (we have many examples of this already).

the government doesnt dictate the narrative, but by getting involved in what is disinformation, what is hate speech, what is (insert anything) it just opens the door to more manipulation. instead of going after those special interest groups and putting up barriers to keep money out of certain things, they are just hopping on the wagon and getting into the mix.

&gt;they may control the mechanisms, but ultimately it is social media influencers that are driving the misinformation, not the key holders or legislators.

people are going to believe what they want to believe, and follow who they want to follow. snake oil salesmen eventually get found out, just takes time. 

unfortunately we live in an age where people just have an 'us' vs 'them' mentality. so things just get polarized. its like centrist or moderate views no longer exist and people dont think for themselves but rather just align everything in their lives to 'what would my group want me to think on this particular issue?'.

interest groups and whatnot are nice, but are not actually part of the legislative process. your objections boil down to that he doesn't have the political capital necessary. that's fine, but that's a purely partisan political objection that could cost ford power, not a legislative obstacle that makes this impossible.",liberals

first of all, buying the world 20 more years of time to do a green transition would be huge, and 100% worth doing. let's say you're an entrepreneur that's strapped for cash and an investor offers you $5 million to buy a stake in your company. would you take it, or would you say \"well, this just gives us 2 more years of runway, but the only thing that will **actually** make a difference is more customers buying our product\".

second, i don't believe that carbon taxes will ruin the economy when the money is given out as dividends. it's not like politicians are just taxing us and keeping the money for whatever favours they want to do. there has been a carbon tax in bc since 2008 and basically nobody notices it anymore. high housing prices - now that hurts. on the other hand, i think climate change *will* be very costly and will cause significant damage to the global economy.

third, i have faith in human ingenuity. i think the human race is intelligent and resourceful enough to come up with alternative ways of powering our society that don't mess up the global climate, and making them scalable and affordable. in fact, we already have come up with a lot of these ideas. we just need a little bit of a push to make them more mainstream, and if people and businesses know you'll save money by going greener, they'll do it.

but the real point here is setting an example. last christmas, when a bunch of politicians took trips to the caribbean, it made people angry, because why would you follow a rule when the rule-giver doesn't want to follow it themselves? similarly, we can't ask other countries to act on climate change if we're not willing to do it ourselves. it really hurts the message if we say \"please stop polluting, but we ain't gonna change\".",conservatives

it is also disturbing to pretend that unwavering devotion to a single person's ideas is so fundamental to a person's core that disagreeing with the pm on any issue at any point, no matter how serious or trivial qualifies as living a lie.

on the other hand:

there is a big schism between conservative ubi advocates and progressive advocates in that conservatives generally want to see a ubi replace administratively costly targeted benefits whereas progressives tend to want to layer a ubi on top of those (which is just actually costly). 

imo using a ubi to replace benefits is pretty cruel as you would be directing funds from the needy to the not as needy, and layering the ubi on top is too expensive.

i'm not going to let you lecture me about being focused on \"white canadians\", you know nothing about my race or immigrant background, you're the one who talks about where immigrants are \"dumped\". if we want conservatives to win elections in this country, which i assume is both our goal, we need to understand what's been driving lpc performance. 

i don't understand your refusal to even contemplate that immigrants/vms overwhelmingly vote lpc more than one would predict if you drew a random group of canadians of all backgrounds. 

here's a blunt question, is your profession tied to canadian politics or polling? mine totally isn't. i'm a pure amateur. all i'm after is looking for ground truth. no axe to grind.

anyway, yes correlation is not causation. but in many realms of analysis you can't run experiments. so you go out looking for natural experiments. if there aren't any of those you logic through what tests would prove this is correlation *but* not causation. that's what i've been doing. i've looked if it's just density. i've looked if it's just age, or income, or education, or home prices, or some unique 416/905 factor. it's not, it's robust to all of that. it even describes 2011/21 swing *much* better than any of those factors. again, i'm just after ground truth, if there's some underlying confounding factor i'm more than willing to admit i'm wrong. 

in the us it's considered more accurate to look at how heavily latino areas voted than it is to look at polls of latinos. polls have way more issues than actual vote results. and they have polls of latinos! we don't of immigrants/vms. i'm sure you'd be yelling \"it's because they live next to the rio grande! it's not because they're latino! all americans regardless of race vote the same! to say otherwise is racist!\" and leading your clients to defeat after defeat.",conservatives

he's talking about something that c-10 didn't do, and which the ndp still wants the government to take proper action on.

&gt;“it’s time for the federal government to establish a regulator that actually understands this file,” and that has the budget, tools and power to take on these issues, angus said.

c-10, meanwhile was about broadcasting regulations, and the ndp voted for it based on stuff like cancon and the ndp's position that cancon supports the canadian arts sector.

it's total dehumanization of the people whose lives have been lost as a result of the us's ideological project and periodic need to impose their will and spill blood in a frenzied nationalistic outburst of fear and violence to satisfy a base political need at home, the interests of capital, or the current panic of the day — drugs, terrorists, communists. it is *horrifying.* we've been so lulled into sleep by thinking the us/western world order is good that we can't even see the piles of bodies surrounding it, the lives shattered, the societies destroyed.

&gt; on december 17, 2020, the superior court of québec granted the request of the attorney general of canada for a third extension of the truchon decision, until february 26, 2021. this was the attorney general of canada’s third request to extend the decision’s coming into effect. the first request was required to give parliament time to consider the proposed changes originally introduced in february 2020. the second request was needed to give parliament more time to consider the same changes, as the covid-19 pandemic caused unexpected delays in the legislative process. as a result, the \"reasonable foreseeability of natural death\" criterion in the criminal code will no longer be applicable in the province of quebec as of february 27, 2021, the date the court’s ruling comes into effect.

&gt; while \"reasonable foreseeability of natural death\" is removed as an eligibility criterion in the proposed legislation, it is kept as a way of deciding which procedural safeguards will be applied to maid requests.

i don't know if trudeau is going to push for a $24,000 ubi or a $2400 one. that can generate an extreme range of total dollars moved.

and i don't know where he'll set the pivot point. if it's set very low, it could be that only a very small number of canadians are net recipients and the total amount of money transferred is very low. if he sets it very high, a lot of canadians will be net recipients, and the total amount transferred will be higher.

without knowing these figures, the program could cost as little as a few hundred dollars a year, to an absolute maximum of a little less than the figure you quoted ($24,000 less, if it is $24,000 and the entire cost is somehow borne by a single canadian).

if you want the exact figures you'll just have to wait for the bill to be written. just remember, moving $1000 doesn't cost $1000, and you won't be able to calculate the cost of the program just by multiplying the payout by the number of recipients. you'll need to consider that virtually all canadians will receive or spend some portion of that payout based on their distance from the pivot income selected, with most congregating near very low values.",liberals
