i tried to find the amendment they were asked to sign in their hand book the other day but couldn't find a single source. if the other parties asked them to sign an amendment stating that climate change in general is a thing... then either the folks who wrote the amendment knew it was never gonna happen and basically just setup a free attack ad; or they actually thought the conservatives might sign, which is nuts because conservatives are not even close to being convinced on anthropogenic climate change.

either way, it's important to see that amendment because the conservatives have been very clear about supporting a move towards greener energy sources. they've been very clear about what their stance is on climate change - that they're not convinced humans are a significant causer of it. and they've been very clear that regardless of what they think about the causes of climate change, they will still sign initiatives as long as countries like the us and china commit to similar measures, which obviously they're not doing. 

on top of that, the report you referenced is setup in such a commonly seen disingenuous way. 

first, it's administered by research co., a well known left-leaning polling service. its run by a guy named mario canseco who constantly posts media articles about his stance that humans are a significant causer of climate change (why do these polling guys always do this?).

couple recent examples of him advocating for consensus:

         - https://thenarwhal.ca/climate-poll-bc-ottawa-2020/
         - https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/mario-canseco-bc-government-failing-to-engage-citizens-on-climate-change?r

that's ok. let's look at the report. it might have some objective value. 

1. first thing that stands out is the pre-question: \"which of the following statements comes closest to your view of global warming (or climate change)?\"
         - ummm, what? how? global warming and climate change are not the same thing. the former refers to a long-term trend - specifically a warming trend. the latter refers to changes in the global climate - both warm and cool. 

2. then the most important set of questions - the ones that ask about cause - only reference \"global warming\":

         - global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by emissions from vehicles and industrial facilities
         - global warming is a fact and is mostly caused by natural changes
         -global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven

i check the date of the report... june 2020. i check to make sure i haven't gone back in time ten years. i check the ipcc's mission statement. no mention of \"global warming\". which, of course, is for reasons we're all familiar with... reasons that made the scientific community reject global warming theory in and of itself. 

so why is mario asking people if they think global warming is mostly caused by natural changes, then summarizing the results by saying \"about one-in-four respondents in the two countries (23% in canada and 25% in the united states) think climate change is a fact and is mostly caused by natural changes.\"

he interchanges the words? why? seriously, why? they're not the same thing. does he not know that? is he trying to manipulate the results? tbh, i don't have a clue, but i'm 100% certain conservatives do not consider those two as the same thing. 

and you'll notice that 64% of canadians agreed to the question that asks if global warming is mostly caused by vehicles and industrial facilities, which obviously isn't true (although i have no opinion on accuracy of the result). but if 64% of canadians agree that global warming is mostly caused by vehicles and industrial facilities, then not only are they wrong, but is it right to make claims like \"two-thirds of british columbians viewing global warming as a reality\"? logically the statement is not wrong based on the results, but then government agencies, non-profit orgs, private businesses, media agencies, social media users, and (hopefully not) academics are going to take that result and say things like \"the majority of canadians agree with scientists that humans are by far the most significant causer of climate change. 

there's many other examples of this type of thing in the report, but this is getting long enough. all i have to say is these kinds of skews are extremely dangerous and can drastically affect our lives. 

this is one of the many reasons why conservatives will not go on record to say \"climate change is real\". if they admit to something as general as that, it can potentially allow politicians to skip the whole \"scientific evidence\" phase, (which they might never be able to move past from at this rate) and start introducing dangerous policies on climate change that result in seriously negative effects on all of our lives. 

i mean, results from research co. surveys are being used by cbc - our national news network - to track polls. just crazy. how are no standards required?",conservatives

seems pretty clear that the liberals want to govern, or due to their minority status, be a part of governing, and largely take the lead.  fine. but is it really the case that the ndp is their only partner?  has the cpc even tried to present an 'offer' to the lpc?  is there nothing that the cpc feels they could do together with the lpc?  sure, an agreement between the lpc and the cpc would probably be more 'left' than the cpc would ideally prefer, but the alternative that they seem likely to get instead is even way more 'left'.

the opposite, more likely.  singh will be taking every opportunity to make the case to whoever will listen that the only reason the government is doing this or that is because of ndp pressure.

gs3dfpv,2021-03-24T06:45:51.000-07:00,"trudeau government won't appeal ruling that struck down part of elections law &gt;when the test is \"knowingly\" doing something, unless it's specifically stated, courts interpret it as you either knew, or reasonably ought to have known.

no, it isn't.

&amp;#x200b;

'reasonably ought to have known' is an objective standard. \"knowingly\" is a subjective standard - the inquiry is what the accused actually knew at the relevant time. these are different tests and both are used in defining the elements of crimes and quasi-crimes.

&gt;\\[30\\]  proof of knowledge, or of its close cousin, wilful blindness, demands a subjective inquiry.  the question is “what did the accused know” and not “what ought he to have known”:  see *r. v. beaver*, [1957 canlii 14 (scc)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1957/1957canlii14/1957canlii14.html), \\[1957\\] s.c.r. 531, at pp. 538, 541-42.  generally speaking, the doctrine of constructive or imputed knowledge based on what a person “ought to have known” has no place in the criminal law:  *r. v. f. w. woolworth co. ltd.* (1974), [1974 canlii 707 (on ca)](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1974/1974canlii707/1974canlii707.html), 18 c.c.c. (2d) 23 (ont. c.a.), at p. 30:

*r v tyrell* 2014 onca 617 (canlii)

willful blindness is legally equivalent to actual knowledge but it is not analogous to a standard of \"ought to have known\". willful blindness still requires a subjective inquiry into what the accused actually knew. willful blindness is deliberate ignorance, a decision not to inquire where inquiry should be made, in order to avoid confirming one's (very strong) suspicion.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;\\[21\\]  because of this, the knowledge that is attributed to an accused is subjective in nature. it is distinct from criminal negligence, which is based on an objective component that requires a “marked departure” from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused: *r. v. hundal*, [1993 canlii 120 (scc)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1993/1993canlii120/1993canlii120.html), \\[1993\\] 1 s.c.r. 867, 79 c.c.c. (3d) 97, *r. v. beatty*, [2008 scc 5](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc5/2008scc5.html), \\[2008\\] 1 s.c.r. 49. **wilful blindness is not premised on what a reasonable person would have done, but requires a finding that the accused, with actual suspicion, deliberately refrained from making inquiries because he or she did not want his or her suspicions confirmed. it is only on that basis that the doctrine may be applied.** if it is, the knowledge imputed is the equivalent of actual, subjective knowledge. i find support for that conclusion in the statement of doherty j.a., speaking for the ontario court of appeal in *r. v. duong* (1998), [1998 canlii 7124 (on ca)](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii7124/1998canlii7124.html), 39 o.r. (3d) 161, 108 o.a.c. 378 at para [23](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii7124/1998canlii7124.html#par23):  
&gt;  
&gt;\"actual suspicion, combined with a conscious decision not to make inquiries which could confirm that suspicion, is equated in the eyes of the criminal law with actual knowledge. both are subjective and both are sufficiently blameworthy to justify the imposition of criminal liability.\"

*r. v. briscoe*, 2008 abca 327 (canlii) (**emphasis added**)

this is crucially different from a standard of 'ought to have known'. a deliberately ignorant person is wilfully blind. an unreasonably ignorant or naive person is not.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;it's just that removing \"knowingly\" lowered the standard of proof for the government and the court ruled that was now too low.

the standard of proof for every element of any crime or quasi-crime is always proof beyond a reasonable doubt. the issue is not the standard of proof, it's the *mens rea* required for the offence.",liberals

teach critical thought and expect it from others.

loosely-defined hate speech laws are not the answer. 

look at reddit. [the admin has admitted reddit's hate policies applies to men](https://imgur.com/a/prpsayc). what could canadian men expect in a 'feminist country' like ours, one that promised 95% of foreign aid to go to only women?

with the ascendancy of a movement where constructive criticism is disdained because it doesn't show enough loyalty to the cause, i don't want a government where unpopular views are decided to be 'express detestation of a people'.

i don't agree that 18+ first nations got vaccinated before 78 year olds in new brunswick, but it's the result of a federal policy and so i have every right to (non-hatefully) express my dissatisfaction with it.

however, too many people would accept any (or no) reason to silence someone rattling the cage about racist government policies that manifestly caused the death of the elderly in canada.

if there's a mechanism to do silence others, people will be itching to use it. so don't build the mechanism.

there's always a first step, and there are many slippery slopes, so the only fallacy is in claiming that that nobody's ever fallen down one.

these definitions of 'hate speech' are too broad and are *meant* (and therefore not 'unintended') to put a limit on free speech in canada.
