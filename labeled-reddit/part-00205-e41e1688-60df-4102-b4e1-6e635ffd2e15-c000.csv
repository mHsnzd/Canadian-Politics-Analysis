since the cpc ended corporate and union donations and set the personal limit so low you can hardly buy out a politician from simple donations, plus it was only twice.

lametti allegedly was also allegedly cleared by the ethics commissioner asking if this candidate could be in the candidate nomination list. then he was selected but the public servant accidentally posted it before the ceremony. quite frankly, i am (pleasantly) surprised to see such a headline from the cbc.

the only way removing lametti from cabinet would be politically advantageous to trudeau is if he was not cooperating like j. wilson-raybould and he wanted a specific outcome for the bill c-10 additional charter review. highly unlikely as insiders say both lametti and trudeau are close and from the same montreal elite social circle. plus there are minister portfolios in way greater political mess, such as defence under sajjan.

&gt;on an linguistic level, the claim that trudeau doesn’t speak french well is simply untrue, bosworth said in an interview wednesday.

&gt;moreover, trudeau speaks french with virtually no accent, she said, and sounds like a regular quebecer. that’s unlike his father, former prime minister pierre elliott trudeau, who she says consciously chose to speak french that was more closely aligned with france.

&gt;[...]

&gt;“some of the things being pointed out are ok in the mouths of just about any other quebecer but not him,” bosworth said.

&gt;one of the main reasons she believes quebec’s media elite have chosen to zero-in on trudeau’s french is because he identifies as one of them — a francophone — but also as bilingual, a cultural intersection she says is construed in the province as necessarily clashing.

&gt;“in his autobiography and in some interviews he states that he considers himself a proud montrealer, a francophone,” she said. but he was born in ottawa and lived there until the age of 13, when he moved to montreal with his father. he continued his education entirely in french until university.

[trudeau unfairly criticized by quebec media for speaking 'bad' french](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/trudeaus-bad-french-skills-a-reflection-of-his-outsider-status-in-quebec-study)

&gt;the researcher discovered a near-unanimous chorus of criticism by journalists regarding the quality of trudeau’s french, which she says suggests they are using language as a way of attacking his identity.  
&gt;  
&gt;she chose to focus on prominent quebec journalists — mostly francophone — because they have historically been “agenda-setters” in quebec society and who have an established role of positioning themselves at the centre of the conversation on what is the correct use of the french language.

how about south okanagan-west kootenay where even half of the meager 8% of indigenous people here is enough to ensure richard cannings won this riding?

elmwood—transcona maybe? of the 91,185 people living there, 19,560 are classified as visible minorities. gonna assume this isn't one of the ridings you were talking about either.

i'll also give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you weren't talking about the districts won in larger cities like vancouver or edmonton that went ndp, such as the new westminster—burnaby district (where only 49% of people are white) and the edmonton griesbach district (where only 65.9% are white) because it would be very silly if those were the districts you were talking about.

the second most powerful argument is economic darwinism; the callous calculation that suffering now will produce a better society in the future. here the idea is that through the marketplace bad ideas will die and good ideas will succeed. the ideas are tested against real world conditions; the market. contrast this to \"the marketplace of ideas\" where anti-science sentiment is stronger than ever to see why this might be a preferred method of progressing society.

meanwhile, annamie paul ran in a riding that she had come a distant fourth in before she was leader*, lost, and then decides to do so again despite being offered a safe riding and came in a distant fourth, and did so while overseeing a massive cratering of green support (and would have overseen a reduction of the caucus to one mp if it weren't for the liberals being shit at getting their candidates)

if you’re speaking about the ones who’ve supported ford since 2018, i doubt it. maybe a few of them but there’s no way in heck that they’d agree with trudeau on a lot of things and would vote con. take the carbon tax for example, ford was bashing trudeau on it a few weeks ago and i’m certain that most of his voter base would’ve done so as well.

in the end. the provincial and federal govts political support depends upon how they’ve handled covid. take bc for example, the provincial ndp did great with covid, called an election upon themselves and expanded their minority to a majority in october.

the carbon tax doesn't incentivize ev market capture, it doesn't even provide funding for it with rebates being provided in amounts in excess of consumption. why are you making assertions that aren't supported by the facts at hand? is it that hard for your to critically analyze this policy?

&gt;of course that tax alone won't solve the climate crisis, which requires a massive investment in decarbonization that goes far beyond it, but that doesn't mean carbon taxation isn't progressive or \"does nothing.\"

you really should look up what the federal carbon taxes mandate is and reassess this unfounded conclusion.

&gt;a good model for how to use carbon taxes is california, which invested the revenue to develop green infrastructure and support disproportionately affected communities cope with the transition to other energy systems.

there are a variety of vaccines using adrenovirus vectors already in development for a variety of diseases, such as hiv, mers, malaria, and tuberculosis, but none have gone past phase 1 trials.

also, many people also have various immunities to the types of adrenoviruses that are used in various vaccines, which could render the vaccine useless in those with such immunities.

a couple of previous attempts at using adrenoviruses as a tool for vaccines have also failed as well; the most prominent example was merck's hiv vaccine, which used a  ad5-based adenovirus vector. because many people have a natural immunity to the ad5 adrenovirus, the trials were halted in 2007 when it became known that the vaccine didn’t work or might even increase the risk of infection.",liberals

h4kk595,2021-07-08T18:30:50.000-07:00,"the green party’s self-destruction is bad for canada i guess there are a few aspects of the liberal come-to-jesus moment on climate that don't accord with the \"elizabeth may as tommy douglas for climate\" thesis. 

1. the liberals were already starting to embrace climate as a major objective [in 2003](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/the-greening-of-jean-chretien/article750726/) as chretien sought a legacy (although the bulk of his record as pm was quite bad). the breakout election of 2004 for the greens didn't happen till 2004. martin emphasized climate quite extensively as pm, but faced a minority and soon lost power. 
2. the biggest liberal turn on climate came from the election of stéphane dion as leader. but it's hard to say that was a strategic move - dion became leader through an old-fashioned delegated convention, which he entered in 4th place with only 16% of delegates. dion's emphasis was a simple reflection of the fact that he'd been environment minister under martin. 
3.  it's not clear to me that the greens have \"kept canada's provincial governments honest.\" the province with the best record on co2 is québec, which has a very weak green party. it's also hard to credit the greens with mcguinty's climate policies. mcguinty made his major promises in 2003, before the major green breakout. the greens did very well in 2007, but this had much more to do with their opposition of catholic schools (and indeed they fell back in subsequent races). mcguinty actually achieved the phase-out of coal in 2014, after the green vote had collapsed (in 2011). notley in alberta also made the politically courageous decision to implement a carbon tax with no pressure from a provincial green party.
4. strategically, in a liberal-tory riding, swinging a tory to the liberals is worth twice as much as converting a green voter. if i'm 100 votes behind, i can get 50 tories to vote liberal or 100 greens to vote liberal. certainly i'm not going to say the green party was a non-factor, but it was a fairly weak pull factor, largely outweighed by the vote-splitting effect of the greens.",liberals

is the media fair in how it builds perceptions?  no, of course not, they're totally unfair, but he should know that and exercise judgment accordingly.  he hasn't, and it's disturbing why he hasn't, probably because he's out of touch, or entitled, or thinks he can get away with it, all of which are not good inferences.

there was nothing stopping him from giving a sombre speech in the morning, then retiring to sussex drive and ordering some takeout for the family.

the modern ccp (post-deng) is a nationalist party, not a marxist-leninist one**. the problem they want to fight against isn't the western political and economic system, but the historical humiliation and subjugation of china to the west. their goal isn't to overthrow capitalism, but for china to become the pre-eminent world power like it once was. so to achieve that goal they're happy to cooperate and trade goods and services with the west, even adopt a limited form of capitalism within their society in order to grow their economy. and even when you see china attempting to intervene in canadian affairs, it's usually aimed by chilling hong kong/tibetan/uyghur/taiwanese activism, not sponsoring left-wing revolutionaries to launch a coup.
