it’s not this ironclad provincial jurisdictional issue that some people pretend that it is. provinces are hesitant to implement the programs themselves because of the high upfront costs. returns take time to manifest and don’t have direct budget line returns. the federal government has much more flexibility to spend money, which is way once cost sharing and funding programs are in place, provinces are happy to take them and implement programs as it lets them go out and say “look we did this super popular thing all by our selves”. 

the feds, on the other hand, are often hesitant to take the led on this thing of major program spending because if they do people start making noise about jurisdiction rather than whether or not the programs would actually help people. 

so we get trapped in this cycle of no one wanting to take the first step, but everyone wanting to be seen has the one to have usher in transformative change. 

if the federal government is serious, they’d ignore provincial governments claiming jurisdiction set up the funding program, or do direct payments (wholly within their right), and let provinces opt in. if provinces want to leave money on the table for a program implementation that is wildly popular in every province because of a surface level understanding of jurisdiction, let them. and let them explain to voters why they don’t think people deserve health care. 

and for the record, the ontario ndp have been fighting for dental care and pharmacare for years and years. it’s taken a back set recently as they’ve shifted to fight against the rapid and callous gutting of social services since 2018 and then fighting for things like paid sick days during the pandemic. 

you can only have so many issues at the forefront at one time. the federal ndp can spend more time on dentalcare because they don’t have to fight to get their conservative government to recognize the very visible realities of the pandemic, as they do in ontario, manitoba, alberta, and saskatchewan.",liberals

that's exactly what it did.  i did forget to mention that it included some quotes from people who pointed out that the lack of diversity was troubling.

that's pretty weak sauce.  almost anyone, (you, me, some rando serving at starbucks) could have told the writer that that lack of diversity was troubling.

what those quoted people could have told us but didn't, (i presume because they were not asked) is who they think should have been given the order of canada.  i'm quite confident they have a few names they can think of.

a profile on those people and why they deserve it puts a face to this and asks the difficult question... why was this person passed over.

throwing race statistics at us gets clicks and tells us that when we eventually see more women get the order of canada, some of them are \"diversity hires\" who got the award only to avoid another click-bait article.

the very same thing happened when justin trudeau made the appointment of more women to cabinet all about his virtue.   his insistence on highlighting the 50% number rather than highlighting who got what position telegraphed the message that he'd made it a priority to make sure he got 50%, no matter who he put in the job.  that seriously undermined the women he put into cabinet.   

**********************
take sex and race out of the equation.   look at the other \"diversity hire\" we do.   does anyone seriously believe that stephen harper was \"choosing the best\" when he appointed his cabinet ministers from quebec?

of course not.  we know that he had a \"regional diversity\" requirement and that at least some of the mps from quebec got cabinet positions only because of where they were from.  mr. bernier was a token diversity hire in the truest sense of the word.   now frankly, i don't care when you do that to some random mp from quebec.   i don't think it matters for diversity and the quebecois if an incompetent man like mr. bernier gets a job.  it only matters in so far as he's given important responsibilities.   that's bad and we really shouldn't do a token diversity hire like that, but at least it doesn't undermine diversity and the people of quebec.   or at least i care less about that kind of undermining.

oh and coming back to this:

&gt; perhaps ask yourself, what imbalanced distribution of awards would cause you to think, \"huh, maybe they aren't being awarded fairly.\"

if they're \"coincidentally\" given out equally to recipients from all provinces regionally, i'd find that suspiciously coincidental.   i'd be especially certain of that if they weren't once and then click bait articles were made attacking that lack of diversity and then \"amazingly\" they just \"happened\" to be regionally balanced the next time.      rather like cabinet positions.  yes, most of those are token \"diversity hires\".  we just don't think of that because we're so used to the tokenism of regional diversity.   heck the lpc had ontario/quebec alternating leaders as an unofficial policy of decades.   hopefully not for the big positions like finance minister and attorney general, but i will bet you that \"regional diversity\" token checkbox hiring has been a factor there as well.",liberals

i think it basically comes down to different views on what electoral reform means for each party. for the ndp/greens for example, having more proportional election results is what matters. where as the liberals place more value on not only voting for your preferred candidate, but ranking the candidates.

making what up? i'm just looking at the total new daily cases for ontario over the past months. around oct 31/nov 1 it started to rise, and has been steadily rising ever since, for around 6 weeks now.

&gt;deaths and icu cases are trailing.

trailing by 6 weeks? where's the evidence for that? every shred of evidence we have indicates a delay of around 2 weeks for deaths vs cases. it's been that way for this entire pandemic. now you're suggesting it's not 2 weeks, but is trailing by more than 6 weeks? that's nonsense.

&gt;the whole fear of this is that the new variant is extremely more transmissible and we have essentially no good evidence it is any less severe

other than the evidence we have that suggests it's less severe lol.

&gt;the new variant literally just got here so your points are irrelevant.

naw. latest evidence suggests that it was already spreading back in october. it's been here for a while.

my case study was millennials. they are the privileged generation who grew up in a period of post-cold war bliss. millions of them (i'm including the united states in this, due to cultural similarity) made the poor decision to get an arts degree, and then live the rest of their lives in poverty. it was the expectation, whether prudent or fanciful, that university would guarantee a well-paying job that led to that decision in the first place. 

and the fact that millions of them all made the same decision points to an institutional structural problem, not an individual problem. 

if millions of people are starving during the great leap forward in china, i don't say \"hey, guess you idiots should have bought that rice paddy patch back in 41' when it was super cheap\". there were clear, structural, macro decisions involved that led to disaster. while individual actions and chance all play a part in people's fates, i never discount the larger structures and trends that ultimately nudge things in one direction or another.

that's right, and it runs an astonishing $7b annually. we are spending *twice* as much on a giveaway to those who have most profited from the housing market than we are on affordable housing programs.

i'm a little hesitant to compare to european rates because their tax systems are quite different. the netherlands, for example, taxes imputed rent!

we can't change housing laws without increasing funding and employment for the government bodies that manage them, but that isn't a simple trick that can be sorted out with some policy.

the fact of the matter is, renters have far more rights and tools to abuse the system than landlords do, especially in a large province like ontario. for every story we hear about a horrible landlord, i guarantee there are at least 50 other tenants matching that up. many landlords are elderly people who cannot work anymore and use their properties as a way to generate income. if we completely change the laws in regards to housing as an asset, not only do you lose the next election, many canadians lose their only source of income.",liberals

i'd argue ranked ballots would only serve to give the liberal party more consistent power, as they would draw support from both sides as a second choice for the other major parties. in 2015, they ran the numbers on this exact scenario based on voting results, combined with regional-level second-choice polling conducted at the end of the campaign, and the liberals would have won [a much stronger majority](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-preferential-ballot-1.3332566) with a ranked ballot. anyone who argues for a ranked ballot is advocating for the liberals to have more frequent and consistent majorities. full stop.

this author does not understand that a ranked ballot does not change the calculus the way they believe it does. when a ballot is ranked, the strategic vote just becomes the second place party on their ballot. in most ridings, this changes nothing, aside from ensuring the liberals get the seat without overwhelming first ballot support for someone else. if we really want to reform how we elect our politicians, it needs to have a proportional element, and that way every vote actually does count. each person who participates and votes for them nudges the party they support slightly higher and might get them one more seat. no vote is truly wasted.",liberals

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-funds-cutting-edge-huawei-research-at-canadian-universities/

&gt;the federal government is partnering with huawei to sponsor leading-edge computer and electrical engineering research at canadian universities. the natural sciences and engineering research council (nserc), a federal agency, is collaborating with the canadian arm of huawei technologies co. ltd. to fund the studies.

&gt;some of the research co-funded with huawei include advanced projects such as chip-to-chip communications over heterogeneous fabrics, intelligence computing memory systems, brain-inspired photonic computing and privacy-preserver graphic analytics.

&gt;jim balsillie, former co-chief executive of research in motion and founder of the centre for international governance innovation, said he considers it astonishing that ottawa would put up money to help huawei obtain advanced technology that will serve to benefit china.

&gt;the nserc research funding was recently announced by ottawa and comes as the prime minister has asked his cabinet ministers to safeguard intellectual property in canada. justin trudeau issued a mandate letter to françois-philippe champagne when the former foreign affairs minister took over the innovation department in a cabinet shuffle last month.

&gt; [–]grahamkrenz [score hidden] 13 hours ago 
the cpc could use cbc, and choose not to. former canadian alliance leader stockwell day is a great cbc commentator, roma ambrose as well, both do a very good job selling the reasonable conservatism we used to have when people like joe clark existed.
somehow stockwell day has transformed from creepy preacher to centre-right advocate of reasonable decisions, he must have discovered weed or something.
cbc’s programs like the house have made me more accepting of cpc views because cpc mp’s and former leaders go on the damn show and talk about them

the cbc represents the public, as in all canadians. what the conservatives are calling for is a complete control of information by the private sector, much like how irving controls all news and information in the maritime provinces.

if you want secularism to mean that the state doesn't perceive theists at all, then good.   let's re-write all of the laws so that there is no observance of theism as special state of being that deserves special protection under the law. 

no theist will get any special observance for their \"sacred\" days.  we can re-write our hate speech laws so that theists no longer get special exemption in section 319 that ensures their holy books can't be seen as hate literature.

does it also hold that anyone named thomas can not in good faith be an agent for secularism?  because they didn't change their name first, and therefor are proponents of christian supremacy due to their birthname, despite their actions?

* the liberals and ndp focusing more on climate policy in their platforms during the past 5-6 years and even the cpc finally embracing carbon pricing on top of that (though the cpc still has a ways to go and their current carbon tax alternative is less effective than a normal carbon tax ) which took away of the gpc's mojo because now just being the environmental party isn't enough for them to stand out.
* the fringe/tinfoil hat wing of the party and revealed issues with racism scaring away potential moderate voters. (also their anti-nuclear policy alienating potential green voters that like nuclear)
* paul and other prospective gpc leaders not doing enough to mend faction rifts within the party.
* members/candidates/mps leaving ship to join up with other parties.

which altogether are poised to slowly eat away at the green's until they become irrelevant. there's nothing wrong with having a big tent party, but the greens big weakness is that there was no unifying force for them besides climate policy and may and that ended up not being enough to keep it intact.",liberals

1. the vaccines work. vaccinated people therefore have much less to worry about related to covid-19, as the stats on hospitalization show.
2. mandatory vaccination is more of a control issue than a health issue. the majority gets to tell the minority how they will behave. the vaccinated are still catching and spreading the virus, so the virus is not going away. however, the vaccinated are not ending up in icu. what is the goal of mandatory vaccination? is it simply a stick? that makes for good politics, but do we really want to set this precedent?
3. how are we going to feel if \"mandatory double-dose vaccine\" becomes \"mandatory annual booster vaccines\"?

you could argue that we are obligated to take care of people who fall sick, and an unnecessary burden on healthcare because of non-vaccination could put the vaccinated at risk should their surgeries or other diagnoses/treatments be delayed on account of treating people with covid-19. that's a valid argument, but i'm not hearing that argument being made by either side, presumably because the main political point is in sticking it to the non-vaccinated.

anyway, it's bad politics because this is going to filter through the media as an anti-vaccine stance, when it is not. it still places burdens on the unvaccinated through the requirement to be regularly tested. it simply avoids creating two classes of citizens by putting a star of david on the unvaccinated.

what it will do is keep some people who otherwise may split the cpc vote by going to the ppc if vaccinations are their main issue. it could be that they've calculated this to be a significant enough of an issue in some close ridings. i could go along with that logic. the only election sign i've seen go up in my area since yesterday's announcement has been a large ppc one.",conservatives

-the government to mandate that forced sterilization stops             
 ( indigenous women are still experiencing this today) and to criminalize anyone who does.

-the government to end all pipeline and other resource extraction development until land claims with indigenous peoples are settled. this isn't an anti-pipeline position, but one of jurisdiction clarification and of good faith consent.

-the government to abolish the indian act and work with indigenous nations to enable self-government and resolve outstanding issues of  land. 

-the government to seriously address discrimination in federal institutions and come up with zero tolerance measures to affect change. 

-the government to stop neglecting the francophonie file. trudeau made a mockery of french's status as an official language by naming a unilingual lieutenant governor in nb. the lpc is completely out of touch with the needs of francophone minorities all across the country and they're letting french services in federal institutions erode. i want some real efforts to ensure linguistic equality and effective policies (like more french-speaking immigration, etc) to revitalize francophone communities. 

-the government to be serious about climate change as opposed to simply paying lip service to it (a carbon tax and a plastic ban isn't going to cut it). serious investments in clean tech, a plan for transitioning oil workers, solar in alberta, programs to incentivize the buying of greener alternatives, etc. 

-the government to implement universal pharmacare, eye care, dental care, mental care, long term home care, etc. 

-the government to implement universal child care.

-the government to implement ubi. or alternatively, universal \"essentials\" (free one bedroom apt/utilities/water/basic groceries).

-the government to implement a living wage. 

-the government to stop selling arms to regimes like the saudis and withdraw from all western-led occupations and movements to overthrow regimes. using trade and sanctions on tyrannical figures and create international coalition to put pressure on these countries.

-the government to ban and criminalize the exploitation of resources from our companies in foreign countries, especially in countries whose clean waters and ways of life have been decimated by these (often paid and armed, instigators of conflict) companies, in underdeveloped countries.

health care is another example. in some ways it makes sense for every province to administer its health care system, but having every health ministry in its own silo creates a lot of issues - a lack of a federal health record and incompatible software, different levels of service, a lack of a cohesive treatment and care regimen, and canadians not being covered for emergency health care when out-of-province (ever out-of-province student, everybody involved in shipping and transport, people who live in border communities, everybody who vacations in canada instead of spending that money abroad). having national standards helps everybody, and is the reason we have transfer payments.

letting provinces, and to a lesser extent municipal governments, implement marijuana legalization is a good example of how different approaches result in vastly different outcomes - some good, some bad.

same with the separatists in québec. most everyone i talk to here in québec mock those people.

nationalism can be a dangerous tool used by those seeking political power, because there will always be people who will agree with the sentiment and allow their loyalty to be used against the greater majority of those around them. 

everyone can be guilty of being too loyal to their communities and allow it to cloud their judgement, so we must always be careful to recognize our own biases.

i myself am loyal to the maritime provinces, being a bilingual acadian who grew up in them. i would 100% agree with uniting them into a single province, as they once were as acadia. however, if a politician started gaining popularity promising exactly that, i would be skeptical and searching for hidden motives. it could just as easily be someone who works for a company like irving who wants even more power and less environmental regulations.

at least back in during quebec's real seperatist moments it was about culture and language and not just economics. and they aren't landlocked so they had some reasonable opportunity for economic development that alberta doesn't have.

the only real chip alberta would have as a seperatist movement would be that canada would have less domestic oil but .... that's a reasonably small chip when no other provinces west of ontario are on the \"leave canada\" boat like ab is, maybe sask? but sask isn't from what i've seen on the same general anti ottawa boat that ab has been under kenney.

i'm not saying there isn't some laurentian consensus issue at hand - there always is. but when it comes to alberta and saskatchewan they aren't really offering much in the way of meeting in the middle either. the rhetoric in those provinces that is bringing about the maverick party is far from helpful and the existing provincial governments aren't exactly helping either. a lot of people are struggling because of provincial jursidiction issues that get blamed on the federal level. and what the federal level can do to help is limited to as much as the provinces want to accept the help. kenney in particular likes to create an us vs them kind of scenario in messaging. wanting to transition off oil and gas from all i've seen and read living in ontario isn't exactly a priority for the ucp out there so what do they really want from the feds when their policy platform is about transitioning off of o&amp;g? its not easy but its not like the blame only goes one way. the real issue is that partisanship and rhetoric are getting in the way of improvements and the maverick party is only adding fuel to the fire. and a lot of the problems ab/sk face aren't going to be fixed at all by any sort of separatist type government. i don't think the bq lead to as many capitulations to qc in the grand scheme of things as is being peddled by western separatist types either.

did they though? the stories i saw online all included the actual video, including the crowd's reaction. even the inevitable dreary editorials by rex murphy and conrad black in the natpo included the clip.

my sense is that people often accuse 'the media' of taking things out of context when they actually mean something else—that a story wasn't worth covering at all, for example. and you might think its pedantic to point that out, but i suggest that it is a distinction that matters. 

quoting someone out of context in a way that is misleading is a serious lapse of journalistic ethics. see the [caj's guidelines](https://caj.ca/ethics-guidelines):

&gt;we make sure to retain the original context of all quotations or clips, striving to convey the original tone. our reporting and editing will not change the meaning of a statement or exclude important qualifiers.

covering a story that you or i think is or *ought to be* a nothingburger is a different animal altogether.

trudeau told a joke. most of the people in the room seemed to like it. but when the clip was more widely circulated, it turns out a lot of other people didn't find it funny. that's not the fault of 'the media.'

now, don't get me wrong, there have certainly been instances where trudeau's words have been presented out of context in a way that is extremely misleading. i'm thinking of the clip of jt saying that \"quebeckers are better than the rest of canada\" used by the tories in their attack ads even though it was clear that trudeau said those words in the context of *criticizing* views held by his father. but i don't think that's what happened with the peoplekind thing.",liberals

the media may not be getting the whole story, but it's being reported as fact in the globe and the national post that:

&gt;quebec can unilaterally modify part of the canadian constitution, prime minister justin trudeau said tuesday

and that:

&gt;\"... it is perfectly legitimate for a province to modify the section of the constitution that applies specifically to them,” mr. trudeau said

i'm not exactly a constitutional scholar, but i'm pretty sure that changing the constitution act requires more than just one province's say - so (outside of a few very specific issues such as sec. 83 and 84).  at a minimum, it requires better explanations.

in the absence of more information, it looks like the pm is abandoning the liberal's \"brand\" of defending federalism (and the constitution that his own father patriated) to pick up a few political wins in quebec.  do i have that wrong?  i hope i do; i remember a time when announcing that quebec could unilaterally change the constitution to do what it wants on language would have gotten the rest of canada hopping mad.  and, seeing quebec get what it wants, it won't be long before other premiers line up and demand federal tax points or something else so *they* could do whatever the hell they want, too.

but, maybe people don't care about federalism anymore.

edit: fyi, editorial from globe and mail editorial board, may 19:

&gt;this is not a fight over symbols; a textual change like this could carry real substance.... letting provincial governments unilaterally drop politically beneficial language into the constitution whenever they feel like it is not what anyone had in mind when this amending formula was conceived. could an alberta government insert a clause saying that hydrocarbon extraction is an essential albertan value?",liberals

hiv prevention and treatment has improved enormously since the fight against hiv/aids really took off in the 1990s/early 2000s, dramatically changing the transmissibility of hiv/aids. screening methods are reliable and available for mass deployment, able to reliably test individual donations and not just batches. in short, what was statistically unsafe in 2001 and unknown in 2010 is known to be safe in 2021. 

we've poured billions into fighting hiv/aids it shouldn't be that surprising to see that investment pay off.",liberals
hkv58cd,2021-11-15T23:47:33.000-08:00,"people dont understand what the \"center right\" or \"far right\" means. this thread i made shows you what it is, so people understand the political spectrum. send this to anyone that calls you \"far right\" i agree. just a quick correction though: the blue tories actually came in with the reformers under preston manning and then under harper when he merged the alliance with the pcs. mulroney was arguably a pink tory.

but yeah the definition breakdown is as follows:

**pink tory:** a socially progressive neoliberal/fiscal conservative (e.g. bay street liberals)

**red tory:** found most often in the eastern provinces, they are socially conservative or paternalistic but economically left. they can be fiscally conservative too but don't mind higher taxes to ensure balanced budgets. they are fond of big government and communitarianism, believing in balancing individual with collective rights.

**blue tory:** found most often in the west, they are culturally/socially conservative neoliberals. they are directly related to their american counterparts, and subscribe to the ideas of individualism and small government.",liberals

not anymore. at the last convention, they made it so any ridings with under 100 votes cast only give x amount of points to the winning candidate, instead of the equal amount if you get over the required amount of points. 

this neuters quebec, atlantic canada, and parts of ontarios influence on the leadership election, giving all the influence back to the prairies. 

guaranteed the cpc will have social conservative leaders for the foreseeable future.",conservatives
