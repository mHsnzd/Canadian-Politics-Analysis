quadra and south were pretty safe pc seats in 72, 74, 79, and 80. flows.

all i'm trying to say is that in a good year for the cpc vancouver‚Äìgranville is definitely in play, it's just that they haven't had a \"good year\" in ten years. ebbs üòâ

(and yes, i believe diefenbaker's 208/265 seat total is the largest majority, seatwise, in canadian history. mulroney got 211 seats,  but as there were 282 seats in 1984 it's a lower percentage of seats).

it's a shame that http://www.election-atlas.ca/fed/ doesn't have poll by poll mapping for 1984, it would be interesting to see the effect that john turner had on quadra compared to adjacent polling divisions in centre and south. the effect a \"special\" candidate has on a riding would definitely skew attempts to map polling divisions from an old riding to a new one. a strict poll by poll reassignment would have, in theory, led to a don taylor over tommy douglas in 1974 in my ancestral riding of nanaimo‚Äìcowichan‚Äìthe islands in 1974. however, i truly believe that if tommy had been on the ballot in the western communities in 1974 (that were transferred to cowichan‚Äìmalahat‚Äìthe islands in 1979) he still would have won, on name recognition alone.",liberals

basically- the people that advertise and charge for conversion therapy are providing an illegitimate service that has been roundly disallowed by medical colleges/associations across the globe. these corporations also tend to be predatory- both false claims/advertising (which is an issue for ad standards), are more heavily involved in the forms of \"therapy\" that range from questionable to illegal (aversion techniques involving electroshock or vomit inducement, shame based activities, corrective rape, etc etc) and might also provide these services in foreign countries (very common for \"camps\" to be run in mexico/latin america by na religious organizations), and occasionally take part in (for lack of a better word) kidnapping people and sending them to camps. 

allowing the advertisement of conversion therapy also lends legitimacy to the practice and would speak to concerned parents/young adults who don't understand what the practice can entail. 

not saying the private ministers/ministries don't also do henious things (picture butte alberta has a church that forces kids into conversion campus outside of town).

there's also the argument that setting up a ct practice is fairly easy money- and there's lots of money to be made. by removing the advertisement and profit aspect corporations will start to fall- and will fall rapidly as people report and investigations begin. 

obviously this legislation will cause some providers to move underground. this is a serious risk. but it will provide survivors the opportunity to pursue legal action and hopefully force plenty of shops to shut down. 

it's also important to note- i have friends that attend of a variety of churches. one provides conversion therapy (for a fee) to parishioners (they include polyamory in their scope of patients) and i have about friends that have been forced into attending ct or risk the loss their families/jobs/community etc (one church in particular is heavily funded, supports anti queer/reproductive health/women's rights activities and is heavily invested in the pc mp in their riding that is particularly noxious in the hoc). but i also have friends that have attended queer exclusive churches and spoken with their ministers about their queerness. they were nudged to the straight and narrow and prayed for. they were not charged a fee. and they were blessed and prayed for when they left to join a queer inclusive church. there's a marked division between churches that hate queer people and churches that \"hate the sin, love the sinner\".",conservatives
guwqz3r,2021-04-17T08:37:23.000-07:00,"n.s., n.l. premiers oppose sharing their vaccine supplies with harder-hit provinces reducing covid spread in other provinces does very little to reduce covid risk in the maritimes, because you have to quarantine for 14 days if you enter the maritimes.  that has been the case for the entire duration of the pandemic, and there are daily flights into halifax from montreal, toronto, etc., and despite much higher covid rates in central and western canada, there has never been significant spread in atlantic canada, because the 14 day quarantine actually works.

the other problem with reacting to case counts in terms of distributing vaccines is vaccines take weeks to be delivered and administered, and then more weeks on top of that to become effective at protecting against covid, so the decisions you make on vaccines today really don't affect anything for at least 4-6 weeks in the future.  there's no guarantee case counts stay the same over that period or that there won't be an outbreak in atlantic canada that is now exacerbated by screwing over their vaccine rollout.

the same type of thing is being discussed in the us, where michigan has like twice the covid per capita cases of any other state but the biden administration is refusing to give them more than their per capita share of vaccines despite having a democratic governor.   if biden won't due this for a political ally, why would trudeau do it for hostile and incompetent premiers like ford, kenney, legault, pallister, etc?",liberals

no. but the question we are talking about isn't \"encouraging\", it's whether or not to make it legal, right? that's not the same thing, so you've just done a very subtle but important change of bars to meet there. to your question - i think that should be legal yes. 

that's kindof the beauty - i don't need to \"encourage\" or agree with something to think it should be legal. and neither should you.

&gt;yeah, i'm not going to engage with this. that isn't at all logical. racism is a behaviour, not an innate characteristic.

that wasn't where my analogy was coming from. it was from your statement and explanation, which was not premised at all on that distinction. you said the group \"creates the problem\" and then solves it. but, it seems like it just makes people aware of something that they themselves can decide is a problem or not. some do and some don't. that's pretty much the basis of every group ever actually. inform people about a problem and offer a solution. that's not inherently abuse as you've suggested.",conservatives

and, you know what taking atlantic vaccines and giving them to ontario would do?

\\- cost the liberals the ns provincial election, which is likely coming this summer or fall.

\\- liberals hold over 3/4 of the seats in atlantic canada, and they need to keep those seats if they want to form a majority.  if they try walking over the region like that, they will lose most of the seats, just like what happened in the 1997 election when they pissed off atlantic canada over ei cuts.

they've said they may add more to the list as they see fit, so we know the list isn't finite nor exhaustive. so if i want to continue to practice my sport, or continue feeding my family through subsistence hunting, how do i know what firearm is okay for me to have? it's not on the list now, but it might be later? manufacturers are even having a hard time understanding if their products are acceptable or not.

if you want to ban things, you have to state why. if you say they're a special type of \"assault-style weapon\" you have to tell us what makes something an \"assault-style weapon\" so we know how to follow the law. if the term really just means \"whatever i feel like putting on this list\" then it's patently unfair to everyone affected and makes it harder for us to follow the law.",liberals

however, unlike the other two parties (because i‚Äôm not considering the greens after the last few months), we do currently have six years of liberal governance to judge them on how they‚Äôre doing. some would tell you canada is burning, others would tell you they‚Äôve been perfect, all in all i would describe their tenure as ‚Äúadequate‚Äù, though with major thumbs up for pandemic response, and, as a progressive *finally* bringing something to the table for childcare.

the worry i have about this whole affair is the idea that one province can unilaterally amend the constitution. quebec is culturally distinct, but it's a province above all. we already have a de facto asymmetrical federation, but highlighting that asymmetry further could alienate other provinces in the long term, weakening the bonds of confederation. obviously kenney isn't backing this because he or albertans love giving quebec special powers, he could be banking on this creating a precedent that lets western provinces break from ottawa's rules. i'm no legal expert, so my understanding of constitutional law could be wrong. but we already have a very decentralized country, and i'm always skeptical of moves that could decentralize our country further. 

i'm talking in possibilities and i don't necessarily oppose this call because there's no way of knowing what this decision means on the long run. my worries could be unfounded, 10-15 years from now this could be ancient history that nobody remembers. in the same vein, this nothing burger could have long-term consequences that we haven't even considered. i think it's fair for anyone who believes in a united canada to be a little concerned about this idea, even if we don't oppose this particular decision.",liberals

if az was the only available vaccine then this would be totally worth it as an alternative to covid morbidity and mortality (imo even more importantly) to reopen our society

one of the things the crown will need to prove is either he is part of or has contributed to a [known terrorist organization](https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/ntnl-scrt/cntr-trrrsm/lstd-ntts/index-en.aspx) like the proud boys or isis. or prove an organization he is a part of is a terrorist organization. this would be easy if they check with his bank and he put in some money to a proud boys patreon or is a listed member.

it's not currently that vague. though a government could plausible add something like greenpeace to the list under the current law. it likely lead to a charter vs legislation fight.

&gt;that is made all the more frightening when you consider the sudden lack of civil and procedural rights a person accused of terrorism finds themselves with.

in this particular case it's not in the grey area. they didn't arrest him when he just had a vague intention to do harm. they plausibly could have arrested him if he posted on social media about his intention and he's a donor or part of isis and that might be too aggressive, more a gray area but that wasn't the case. here is the full law:

https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-13.html#h-116339

it's not **a**, and he easily satisfies **b - ii**. **b -** i would be if he has any connection for a listed terrorist organization or they have to prove some organization he's related to is a terrorist organization. 

&gt;the world has essentially been taking scotus justice stewarts \"i know it when i see it\" approach to pornography

&gt;the rebate doesn't come every paycheque, but we know 53% of canadians live paycheque to paycheque. they can't eat this cost. 

10-20$ extra in taxes is not going to break the bank. mountain out of a molehill.

&gt;further, more programs to help the poor is just another wealth transfer, something that further hinders society, as it takes away the earning aspect. 

yeah, no, programs that alleviate pain on the poor dont produce inefficiency. this is just economic illiteracy, given poor people spend a greater portion of their pay check you can significantly grow the economy by putting more money in their hands, raising the minimum wage for example or a negative income tax


&gt;there is no cost to not doing anything. this needs to be understood. that's not an opinion, it's just factual. i mean... statue of liberty grab any other photos you want of landmarks. they're all the same.

your memory is a little off, he never proposed mandatory minimums for drug possession. that was for cultivation, and it very clearly was intended to go after drug dealers etc, not punish people for smoking dope. 

and frankly, while some of his minimums did have support from the public and the cpc supporters this one really didn't have as much. 

but you miss the point. the point is that for some time the right has looked at rehab as being something that should be offered. the left, however, has seriously pushed for legalizing drugs and distributing them free as a 'harm reduction' solution. 

the approach he's put forward is the conservative opinion - but the language and terms he's using are straight out of the left wing playbook. if you just listened to the headline and a few of his 'quotes', you'd think he was proposing the left accepted solution when in reality he's proposing the right. i'm not commenting on which one is the correct solution, i'm noting his use of language to sell a position to the left that they might not normally have felt was the best one.

as a public health measure, safe injection sites do help reduce the spread of blood-borne diseases like hiv and hepatitis c by providing clean needles. by having drugs like narcan on hand, as well as trained medical staff,  safe injection sites also reduce overdose deaths.

safe injection sites don't mean free drugs, and i question whether they help many addicts get off drugs. i do think they have a place in public health policy though. treating lifelong diseases like hiv is incredibly expensive.  overdose deaths from opioids is a problem that is becoming much more prevalent. preventing both of these is objectively a good thing.

safe injection sites aren't the fix-all solution that many on the left make them out to be, but they do have a role to play in public health planning. combining them more with rehab programs and things like methadone maintenance would be a good idea. (methadone is a prescription opioid for addicts who fail abstinence treatment programs multiple times). this would require closer collaboration with the provinces.",conservatives

&gt; conservative leader erin o&amp;#039;toole offered on sunday a &amp;quot;compassionate&amp;quot; plan to tackle the opioid crisis, treating it as a national emergency to help those battling drug addiction.

&gt; during a campaign stop at an addictions rehabilitation centre in new westminster, b.c., o&amp;#039;toole said 17 canadians&amp;#039; deaths each day are related to opioids - and that the health crisis has deepened during the pandemic.

&gt; law enforcement should focus on dealers and traffickers, not on those suffering from an addiction, o&amp;#039;toole added.

i agree that it was racist to tokenize jewish members of the house this way, asking them to answer for the actions of extremists they have nothing to do with.

the cbc did the same with singh, asking him to denounce the extremists behind the air india bombing. that was also racist. however, i think it is important to understand the context. both the cbc and lascaris were looking for political gotchas, which is why the cbc went after the ndp leader about it and why lascaris went after only these two particular jewish members of the house. that isn't an excuse for the awful tokenization, but it is perhaps an indication that it was a bad political chess move and not a sign of underlying racist hatred.

in cases that are more difficult to prove, the crown attorney may elect not to take a charge to trial because the process is lengthy and expensive. unless the crown attorney feels like there is a strong chance they will be able to convict, they won't take a case to trial. 

this means that the charges against this candidate were serious enough that police laid charges. the police believed the victim, but the crown attorney elected not to take the case to trial. it seems from the article as well, the victim in this case had been through the criminal justice system as a victim before.

and no - there were no debates about how wynne might negatively affect trudeau in 2015 pre writ.  after the election maybe when she lost but no, there wasn't anything like this. 

typical liberal - expects others to address their points but dodges even simple questions posed to them. hey - here's a hint, if you have to be dishonest to make your point, it's probably not a very good point.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;everyone has a right to bodily autonomy, but the fetus is not conscious, aware, or in many cases recognizably human.

neither are coma patients...are they not human either?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;then there's the awful economy that shackles many young couples into a lifetime of living paycheck to paycheck due to the horrific costs of raising children.

oh...so that's horrific and ending a child's life in the womb isn't? got it.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;promoting abstinence is a direct contravention of human nature.

i've gone nearly 3 decades without sex rather easily. it's probably attributable to the fact that i'm a short man and thus sexually undesirable to women, but at least i'm not a hypocrite in my stance. i may feel differently if i had the option of having sex, but hypotheticals are just hypotheticals. if i can go without sex, anyone can.

&gt;adoption - doesn't deal with the bodily autonomy issue. you're still forcing someone who \\*doesn't want a child\\* to bear and birth one for \\*your\\* comfort.

not my comfort...for the defenceless fetus in the womb that fights for its life as it's been killed (abortion videos will show this). again, the vast majority of abortions are done by women who were not forced to have sex. i support bodily autonomy up to the point where it hurts others.",conservatives

were at their highest and we fared pretty well from the 2008 crisis due   
to effective banking regs

wow that's some pretty hard core revisionist history :) 

canada faced the worst recession since the great depression. and it wasn't the banking regs that saved us at all. harper pulled some extremely clever tricks that frankly nobody else had ever done and it paid off big time. our recession was far shorter and less deep than anyone else's. say what you like about him otherwise, but financially he was a genius. 

of course good banking regs were a good thing too - brought in by the last conservative prime minister. 

&gt;he sold crown assets

ultra minimal. it made little difference. he returned the country to balance in exactly the time line he said and the economy was nice and strong. the parliamentary budget officer, with whom he fought often enough, admitted as much. trudeau inhereted a strong economy and a balanced budget - and immediately went into debt for 5 years till the pandemic hit, and then borrowed more money than had been borrowed in the 150 years before. 

&gt; this is a different time and the situation does not look as good.

true - covid is unique. but harper's skill getting through the last mess is exactly what we could use now. justin is making a really bad situation really worse. 

&gt;costs of more extreme weather events are increasing as the events get   
worse, inflation is a huge risk, housing is a massive bubble....

yes, most of which is the liberal's doing. it's going to take a talented hand to guide us out and trudeau isn't it. 

&gt;but to count on jobs to increase government revenue indicates a leadership that is not paying attention or are being willfully ignorant.

well that's simply not true.it is the only way out in fact, there's no chance of us providing even the basic services and servicing the debt if we don't. so the leader has to find ways to increase jobs, increase investment and productivity and at the same time manage the costs to minimize the damage until you can out grow it. 

&gt;technological unemployment is the greatest threat to the current design of our economy.

that's just plain silly. 

which isn't to say we don't have some real issues to face. our productivity is low. we are no longer as attractive as we were in the harper years for business to invest here. we're starting to fall behind in innovation. etc etc. 

but guaranteed trudeau won't be the one to fix that. 

&gt;i see nothing in the cpc platform as a contingency plan to support the viability of their platform.

to be blunt, you're very clearly not qualified. a lot of the spending is focused on getting businesses in key sectors back on their feet and recovering and adapting. as the covid relief comes off and workers decide to go back to work that will help entice them and provide for upgrades to make them more valuable where possible. and reducing the amount of 'free' money going into the hands of people will help cool down inflation. 

increasing housing starts by 20 percent obviously creates a lot of good paying jobs provided it's handled right. doing it too soon would mean risking inflation. but soon enough. 

the 'carbon savings' thing is a very clever built in hedge against the next recession. and there will be one. but now the gov't can inentivize people to spend that money when the time comes and that drives up spending and keeps the economy going. harper did it with gov't money when he did the homeowner's rebate for upgrades, this will set the stage for that much better. nice to have a safety net build in. 
their plan to achieve balance within ten years is doable. as long as they set their goals along the way and hit them, that's going to make business a lot more comfortable coming to canada. 

he's mentioned a focus on trade too, tho the details are thin. but - that's another area we have to get back to focusing on. harper did a lot of good there too and much of it has been undone by trudeau. 

it's doable. it's not going to be easy and it'll take some skill but it's definitely doable.",liberals

hfdm3ud,2021-10-04T03:55:40.000-07:00,"issam saleh: the conservatives cannot afford to alienate muslims if they hope to win next time around to answer your question maybe i could attempt to summarize some of the different views of culture that different people tend to have and how it relates to immigration. i think many more left leaning people (which i am not saying you are) have a very inaccurate view of the immigration debate, largely because people are often unwilling to talk about it for fear of being called racist, and often that just leaves those that are racist being the only other voices out at the extremes.

ironically enough the white nationalists and the progressives have essentially the same views about culture as each other but applied to different groups. where they approach the question of culture seems to be from a position of race and culture being roughly equivalent. you can see this on the progressive end with the natives, the argument being that they (the natives) lay claim to the land of north america in a cultural sense as that is their ancestral land, and thus their culture is closely tied with it. the white nationalist believe a similar thing, that white people may not have their roots here in north america as long as others but that it was white british that created this country as it was so it should be white people for whom this land is for (in europe this problem becomes even more interesting as the europeans are native to europe). there are a lot of issues with this view, and in practicality it does not work well, but it does touch on a certain unease that people have in regards to cultures, land and how different people's interact with each other.

now we can look at the progressive view of culture, not applied to natives, which seems to be prevailing right now. at its simplest and least thought out, which is what i find is where most people understand it. the belief seems to be that all cultures are functionally the same past the \"surface level\" experiences of say, food, clothing, religion (though they also see all religions as fundamentally the same too), or else if they do concede more deep rooted differences they take it for granted that immigrants will just meld into our current culture seamlessly and be grateful for the opportunity to join our multicultural society that values what is seen as surface level differences. there i think is another level to this that is more thought out that i will try to articulate after outlining a brief summary of the conservative stance.

the conservative stance might be hard for me to convey in a relatively short comment so bear with me and i may in fact not convey it well. the conservative view i guess sees culture as something inherited from our ancestors which was cultivated through living in close proximity to one another and developing a shared sense of values and a shared identity, the reason this often gets so heavily tied up with race is simply the fact that those who live in the same location and have for generations will be predominantly of the same race. you can easily dismiss that race is defining of culture by pointing for example to how culturally different the french are from the british, or the germans, though yes, overall they are very similar they are also distinct from one another. borders are both the product of these distinct cultures and also what makes these cultures distinct, their enacting serves to solidify what makes one group separate from another in terms of values and behavior.

so understand that conservatives see that a country is united by a shared culture and that is what makes them feel a part of a broader society, part of a group, part of a country. this sense of culture is heavily tied to heritage, in that you inherit your values and traditions from your parents (who inherited it from their and so forth), and they are solidified by your peers. cultural values and traditions are not easily broken. so the issue that conservatives see with immigration is that the more people you bring in to a country from elsewhere, the more rapidly those cultures values and traditions change and not toward the direction that those who've inherited the culture have a say in. this does not of course mean that an immigrant cannot integrate into a culture, in fact in about two generations immigrants typically become indistinguishable from their fellow countrymen culturally, while maybe retaining some more surface level habits from where they originated such as food. and indeed cultures very often benefit from such contact with each other, usually in the realm of cuisine, just look at all the dishes worldwide that are just adaptations of dishes from other places.

the key thing here is that idea of integration. you should integrate into the culture that is tied to the people and the land that you have come to live, as a culture and country should prioritize itself. integration becomes hard though when the rate of immigration becomes too high as instead of integrating those immigrants may instead elect to keep their culture, section themselves off into small communities where they can keep their culture going and avoid proper integration, and then once their population is large enough they are able to sway the country politically in ways that would be alien to the original culture, and change the overall cultural identity of a country. a conservative view would be to see the world and all the diverse cultures that populate it and want to conserve that, conserve the differences, as each country represent something different and unique and worthy in it's own regard. and borders being what maintain those distinctions and richness of the different cultures.

now this brings me to the more thought out progressive view. in the way that conservatives see the preservation of distinct cultures as desirable and the need for borders to maintain them, the progressive believes either that cultures can be maintained simultaneously while living in close proximity to people with entirely different cultures (this is in my opinion not realistic), or they place no value on the preservation of culture at all and instead look at how cultures have shifted and changed over time and come and gone and moved and believe that we can live in a sort of post culture world where we integrate and create new cultures that are an amalgamation of parts from across the world, and that to make progress as a human species this is the way forward and not the preservation of what makes us different. though oddly this belief is held simultaneously to native ethno nationalism, so go figure.

as for my view i lean toward the conservative view, partly because i love to travel and i would see it as borderline pointless to travel the world and visit countries that have no distinct culture. but i can still see value to the progressive goal of mixing and i can't say i am particularly unhappy when it becomes easier to engage in the practices of other countries without having to travel so i think open debate is important for finding the appropriate middle ground, and to make sure we aren't alienating the people who've been here for generations and finding that the government doesn't give a shit about their culture (unless they live in quebec that is).",conservatives

you may think it's unhelpful or an exaggeration, but as i said, fptp does effectively disenfranchise people depending on where they live. you may call it something different, but the end result is the same: millions of canadians choose to stay home, and millions more choose to vote and have those votes ignored. it doesn't feel very democratic, especially when 94 other countries use proportional systems.

what is the main point of democracy? isn't it to represent the will of the electorate in government? how is it even remotely democratic then when getting 35% of the popular vote can give one party unchallenged legislative and executive power for four years? does that not effectively disenfranchise the 65% of voters who voted for a different party? i don't see how my argument doesn't hold up.",liberals

i think it was obvious that atwin was going to capitulate on her strong stance on israel after joining the lpc. the liberals aren't exactly an anti-israel party, so it wasn't the ideological disagreement that made her cross the floor. it's that a powerful green party insider promised to defeat her and the leader didn't stand up for her. a tense relationship with the leadership, and a seat targeted by both major parties - her political career was toast as a green. this was probably the main factor in her leaving.

call it cowardice or a betrayal of her principles, but i think she made the right call. the left often has a habit of forgoing political pragmatism in favour of ideological purity, but you can't enact the changes you want to see without some level of power (even if it's just a balance of power role like the ndp has), and gaining power in a country as diverse as canada necessarily requires some capitulation and picking battles wisely. atwin may feel strongly about what she calls israeli apartheid, but based on her political history, this is nowhere even close to her biggest priority. so i think she decided to give up this particular fight so she can fly under the banner of a party that actually wants her, and maybe play a nate erskine-smith role of advocating more left-wing priorities that the government wouldn't propose, but could be convinced to come around if it gains support within the party.",liberals

just to reiterate a private company can censor people, and they do it all the time. it's also not just the conservatives. these platforms are the public square now, and we need to find a way where unpopular speech can be exposed to sunlight. hell its illegal right now to go and gather to spread political messages.",conservatives

and i‚Äôll admit i‚Äôm not necessarily disagreeing that private companies limiting content isn‚Äôt necessarily a form of censorship. i‚Äôm arguing that the ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù that the author of the article, as well as every outraged right wing talking head, is talking about isn‚Äôt censorship in the way that they‚Äôre portraying it. the billionaires that own facebook, twitter, youtube, etc, aren‚Äôt trying to scrub conservative speech from their platforms. they‚Äôre trying to scrub the same kind of tactics that isis used to radicalize people to their cause and so-called ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù are getting caught in the net because they frequently use the same techniques on the same topics. they‚Äôre not limiting conservative topics. they‚Äôre limiting hate speech, divide-and-conquer language, othering tactics, etc. and they‚Äôre usually only doing it when they get enough blowback for allowing it to fester on their platform. just look how long it took for reddit to get rid of the_donald after it took a turn from satirical shitstorm to radicalized alt-right recruitment platform that led to the assaults of many and the death of at least one person.",conservatives
