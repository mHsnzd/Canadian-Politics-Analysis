that being said, whether you agree with it or not, he does have a lot of baggage and will only accumulate more the longer he stays in office, as does every pm. that's precisely why the liberals in the article were trying to avoid having the election be a referendum on him and why they expressed concern about future scandals. therefore, i suggested that going into the next election with a new leader, who has no baggage, may be a good idea. i expressed this suggestion in good faith because i am concerned with having a tory government.

* the liberals haven't been able to regain their 90s-early 2000s high and outside of a few meaningful reforms (carbon tax, child tax credits, marijuana legalization etc.) they have became fairly hesitant to make any comprehensive reforms in regards to either social policy, increased trade/economic liberalization, electoral reform or welfare/benefits reform etc. they've basically become a party that wants to maintain most of the status quo without taking any risks.
* the reform/alliance wing of the cpc has disproportionate influence over the party and it's political baggage is increasingly keeping moderate and undecided voters away from them. additionally, the cpc is bringing less proposals of it's own to the discussion table, making it more of the anti-trudeau party than anything else.
* the ndp keeps playing off american social issues/talking points that don't have as much traction in canada (green new deal, $15 minimum wage, student loan forgiveness, \"fair trade\" labeled protectionist policies to attempt to increase manufacturing &amp; auto-industry employment etc.) and tends to have a hard time expanding it's base beyond traditional ndp voters.
* the bloc is back, but rebranded as an autonomist/regionalist party rather than a separatist party.
* the green's have an unfocused/disunified base on top of other internal issues.

basically until either  the liberals, cpc or ndp change leaders and make enough proposals to rile up large swaths of voters outside of their established base, we'll probably be stuck in the current limbo. failing that, electoral reform could also force the party's to evolve and cooperate with each-other more to remain relevant.",liberals

https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/housing-index

the skyrocketing of prices across canada over the last 2 years is primarily pandemic driven - work from home allowed people in the city to sell their very expensive homes and outbid everywhere else. the pandemic generally led to really good savings for people who weren’t effected by it economically (so more people could buy more homes) and the price of materials has skyrocketed due to shortages.

now, it’s obviously still an unacceptable situation and something needs to be done for my generation to ever afford homes. but the liberals did have a decent cooling effect going for a few years before the world economy and all our lives were upended.

the issue now is supply. we need to increase supply by building as many units as possible but also making it more unattractive to buy housing as a speculative asset.

there are some very good things with immediate impacts in the liberal plan such as banning blind bidding. i don’t think it goes quite far enough but the carrot and stick method to get nymby’s to build is a good thing, and i am personally fairly happy with the rent to own program proposal.

what i want though is a scaling yearly tax levied against all additional properties after your first, and a removal of capital gains exemptions from anything but the primary residence with even those capital gains exemptions halfed. there are too many incentives for people to hold multiple houses as assets rather then invest elsewhere.

it's an easy out to a complicated problem, and apparent solutions may make the situation worse.  like removing section 230 likely would.

the issue right now is perceived bias, as conservatives of all ranks feel that they're under attack.  but an army of shitposters that fall under the conservative flag aren't doing them any favours either.

then there is the issue of conspiracy theories, some of which have turned out to be true.  these are problematic to many as they serve mainly to disrupt public trust.

as biden has suggesting removing 230, it would seem that this simple out being stated repeatedly isn't that simple.

removing 230 has no effect on political parties, corporations or celebs.  it would only stamp out the rights of everyone else to their freedom of expression.

with all due respect (and i'm trying to read your post in good faith), i don't think the attitude expressed in this post is helpful. i believe that the exchange of ideas, and reasoned debates, are one of the foundations of liberty and a healthy society. and i think it's important for all sides to listen to the other side and try to understand their views charitably. (you seem to be a catholic, or at least appreciate the catholic tradition, so i'd point out that st. thomas aquinas and the medieval scholastics valued this kind of thing)

**is there really an existential threat?**

now you - and anton - seem to believe that western civilization, or everyone good about it, is under an *existential threat* from liberals and/or leftists who want to destroy it. this is a *very serious, inflammatory charge*, and it's the kind of thing that can lead to open conflict and break down the bonds between people in society (and you and i seem to agree that that's not a good thing). to make sure i'm not misunderstanding you:

1) what do you see as essential to western civilization or a healthy society?

2) how do you define \"left\" or \"liberal\", and what is the essential difference that distinguishes them from \"right\" or \"conservative\"? what are examples of \"right-wing values\"?

3) in what ways do you think the \"left\" or \"liberals\" are causing the downfall of western civilization? do you believe that they're doing it intentionally because they believe western civilization or right-wing values are bad, or are they well-intentioned but unintentionally causing the decline of western civilization?

**a few other points:**

1) i do not believe there is, or is likely to be at any time in the near future, a mass deplatforming of conservative views. if president trump was removed from major tech platforms, not for political views, but on the grounds that he was inciting violence, i don't think it's reasonable to expect that alasdair macintyre or edmund burke will soon be removed from libraries and suppressed in university humanities departments, or that anyone who quotes st. augustine on social media will be put on a watchlist.

gi90hq2,2021-01-05T09:00:21.000-08:00,"trudeau says he's 'frustrated' with the pace of vaccine rollout it would be an appropriate comparison between the federal governments of canada and the us if there was a remotely equivalent chance of getting vaccines at the same time and the same rate as the us.

in the world where the us is the biggest market for the vaccines and put up a huge chunk of funding to produce it, there's no possibility ottawa is getting deliveries as soon as washington. our more appropriate comparisons are other western countries (not uk who has their own domestic vaccine) and we're doing quite well there.

the goal by coyne is to criticize the federal government, so he's setting a benchmark that does that, regardless of it being a reasonable metric.",liberals

our liberal prime minister didn’t have a good plan for a vaccine, he gave too much money to big canadian pharma companies, with little track record (involving flu/covid) yet pfizer seemed to recognize some good canadian pharma company and hired them to help.

justin trudeau, has not told us what his plan is. at this time, he has said, “it’s up to the individual.” druggy douggy is just repeating what justin tr-um-deau is saying. 

justin trudeau is a liberal puppet. doug ford is a conservative company man.",liberals

i really enjoyed it.

i think my favourite part starts with about 8:00 left in the clip, where steve asks about 'insubordination' and so on.  (the theme continues later when they talk about 'team' sports.)  i hate the team sports analogy, and i hate this idea that the ministers simply exist to do trudeau's bidding.  yeah, not all ministers are rocket surgeons, but good lord, i think we'd get better governance if we tried to draw a bit more from the various people around the table.

&gt; it is sad that people here are downvoting this post so that others don’t get a chance to see it.

yeah, not sure what is happening on the sub, but there does seem to be a lot of downvoting...more than in past years, i think.  the whole premise of this sub is supposed to be \"r_slash_canadapolitics: polite discussions about canadian politics.\"  i mean i realize it always had a leftish slant, but at least there were conversations.  now, just scan and vote, scan and vote, scan and vote.  what's the point?",liberals
