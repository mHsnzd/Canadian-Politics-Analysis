*as my mp, what are you doing to bring affordable internet to our riding?

multiple governments over the years have pledged to lower our internet bills in canada, but not a single one has delivered.

the time for being patient is long gone. it’s been more than a year since the start of the pandemic, during which canadians have needed the internet more than ever before. yet not only has the federal government failed to ensure people can afford to connect, it’s actively made the affordability problem worse by publicly prioritizing big telecom’s profits over the interests of canadians.

in canada, we already pay some of the highest prices in the world for our internet. your constituents have been patient, but things are getting worse, not better. now, we’re done waiting — it’s time you made it clear what your office is going to do to catch us up.

sincerely,*

some people want that. they are willing to exchange the bad (far more commuting, far more traffic, far more maintenance, etc) for the good (space, quieter at night).

some people don't want that though. some people want something easier to live in. suburbs are a hard life. there is more traffic, everything is far away, have to mow large lawns and vacuum all that square footage. i've done it, it's not pleasant. but these people don't want to live in cramped condo towers either that blot out the sun from the street. i personally haven't done this myself, but any condo development that's in a convenient neighborhood is built to maximize units inside of it. they are all quite small.

zoning regulations have made the development of certain types of neighborhoods that exist today, illegal. i will not buy property, because no property built today is what i want to live in. i watched in the past five years, a triplex with a large backyard and no front yard torn down and rebuilt into condos with no backyard now, but extra parking instead because there are parking minimums that exist now, and they added a front yard, so now the floor space is much smaller. unbelievable.

in the end, these rules and restrictions must be removed, and medium density development must be allowed to happen again, before we resort to more economically unsustainable sprawl.

the purpose of a projection is to reasonably show ranges of probability - not to be a time machine or crystal ball. this is math, not science fiction. 

you may not enjoy it, but a +/- 40 or even +/- 100 projection is just as good and useful for voters and academics as a +/- 5 projection. 

the projection tells us that, at the current aggregate levels of support and with the variances in polling that is out there, while the liberals have a comfortable lead the exact number of seats they might win is very much up in the air. in fact, it appears that there are many, many reasonably competitive seats that might go either way.

that means that in a fptp system, this projection indicates the voters in even modestly competitive ridings should be aware that there is potential for swing and not take the results for granted.

it also means that canadian politics are inherently realms of madcap chaos where dramatic swings are often possible, as there are normally dozens of seats won by less than one or two standard polling deviations.",liberals

hez89di,2021-10-01T00:22:59.000-07:00,"max bernier and the folly of electoral reform there's something to the argument of this article, but it seems poorly articulated to me. whether its even a worthy argument i'll leave to others. 

the problem isn't that pr gives any power to extremist parties. the problem is that pr gives *outsized* power to extremist parties, flipping rather than eliminating the vote-power disparity of pr.

to govern in these systems, a coalition needs 50% of seats in parliament. it's a zero sum game. you either have the 50% or you have nothing. that means if you have two parties that receive 45% of the vote each and one that receives 10%, they nonetheless have *de facto* equal power, because each has equal ability to form a government with one of the others. at the point of coalition negotiations, relative size doesn't matter, only the ability to hit 50% plus one vote. 

in other words, if a party with 10% of the vote has 50% of the power in government, you have a similar scale of voter-power disparity to that in fptp, where a party with 39% of the vote can have 100% of power.  

so the problem in canadian terms isn't that it would be possible for bernier's ppc to hold seats. the problem would be that in a coalition of ppc, reform and progressive conservatives (in a hypothetical pr political realignment), a ppc that had 5% of the votes could hold *de facto* 1/3 of the power in government, as they would be one of three parties whose zero-sum commitment was needed to maintain power. 

of course, i understand that its not exactly as clean cut as this. relative electoral options, potential upside and downside for each negotiating party relative to vote ceiling and floor and other factors play a role in pr coalition power structures. i also understand that there are more benefits to pr than simply an attempt to equalise voting power in a fair way, something it doesn't really do, that are more compelling to a lot of people, like allowing for broader representation and ending artificial regional political homogeneity.

the pandemic was a shift in consumer habits that the entire world has not seen in over a century. people simply stopped spending money on a lot of consumables, paid off their debt, and then bought houses. interest rates were cut because how could you _not_ when a total economic collapse is on the table, as all nations considered in early 2020. the end result is that [25% of millennials](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/royal-lepage-survey-nearly-half-of-canadians-aged-25-to-35-own-their-home-one-quarter-of-these-homeowners-have-purchased-a-property-since-the-onset-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-878974065.html) who own a house have bought since the pandemic started. recall that everyone, _everyone_ expected a housing crash in early 2020, globally. lumber mills cut production in anticipation of that, and when demand didn't drop prices shot up, increasing the price of new builds and the renos that flippers were doing. absolutely ridiculous to blame trudeau for essentially a meteor strike. realize also the same housing explosion happened in the us in past year as well and in several other nations. and _still_ housing prices have not shot up on the prairies. they [lost people](https://www.sookenewsmirror.com/news/more-people-moved-to-b-c-than-elsewhere-in-canada-in-the-last-year-statcan/) in fact.

h2f8ovk,2021-06-19T22:45:30.000-07:00,"‘people are a bit losing the plot’: green founder says the party needs to get back to basics and focus on the planet why does the green party even need to exist at the federal level? the ndp has become a pretty strong environmentalist option - i know their provincial wings haven't always been the best on the environment, but federal and provincial parties aren't the same. the liberal government has also taken strides in climate action, and the cpc is being dragged kicking and screaming into some semblance of a climate plan. and i dont think the green party has had anything to do with this acceptance of climate action, this is just the norm for centre-left, and now increasingly centre-right parties around the world.

beyond that, the green party doesn't seem to offer anything unique either. at some time, the greens ran basically as liberals with a climate focus (as well as some fringe stuff), and recently they've pivoted in a more ndp direction.

i'm no fan of dimitri lascaris, but i think the only real niche left for them is to be a hard-left eco-socialist party, to the left of the ndp. but i dont think this is a position that most canadians could be persuaded to vote for, and they would struggle to win any seats with this kind of platform. the only genuinely socialist party in canada is québec solidaire, so maybe the greens could become an option for the most left-wing sections of central/eastern montreal. they could also have the substantive effect of dragging the ndp further to the left, which of course would be great for leftists in canada, but would ultimately free up space for the liberals.

the conservationist/tories on bikes approach is an electoral dead end, though it may have the desirable effect of forcing the cpc to be more environmentalist. this would be personally my favourite outcome, but it would also be a political seppuku for the green party as there are very few \"green tory\" ridings in canada (except maybe cottage country). regardless, the green party membership seems to be moving to the left and this author is on the losing side of the argument.

the \"ndp but greener\" approach almost worked for them in 2019 when the ndp's numbers were dangerously low, but jagmeet resuscitated their numbers and that highlights the weakness of that strategy - it requires a bigger party to fuck up. \"lpc but greener\" is an even worse approach because most liberal voters seem to be content with the government's actions on climate change, and those who want more seem to have faith in the liberals to keep going further. the approach of stealing ndp/grits' lunch may work in some provinces but not federally.

maybe they could follow the lib dem model of the uk and become a fiercely localist party, building strong bases in communities with niche local issues that the big parties aren't talking about.

but with all this said, i don't understand what the purpose of the green party even is at this point. the gpc membership, near as i can tell, is broadly made up of left-leaning people who have grievances with the lpc or the ndp for whatever reason, people who are politically active but don't like traditional partisan politics, and some people with really weird fringe views that other parties won't accept. and a good chunk of their voters seem to be protest voters. this isn't the recipe for a serious party.",liberals

i'm not sure about new zealand, but in canada, i feel the fact that every vote would count (or, at least, be far better represented) means that the conservative party in canada could divide back into something like reform and tory (aka progressive conservative), and win even more votes and seats than they currently are able to with one united party.  this would give right-of-centre parties an option for developing coalitions and/or confidence and supply agreements after an election and gaining control of government more often than they do now.  it would solve the infighting that often occurs within the conservative party now between its two factions.  it would allow more seats to be won in the east (the atlantic, quebec, and the gta) along with the seats it currently wins in the west.  and it would lead to getting many blue libs being more comfortable to switch sides.    


proportional representation would be a winning move for right-of-centre voters, i feel.  and everyone having better representation in a government that actually reflects how people voted would lead to a better more stable nation as a whole.",conservatives

so here's the thing. the bank has already said it's going to raise rates to fight this. but that actually takes a great deal of time to have an effect. and the banks have a bad history of overshooting the mark as they ratchet up interest too quickly because it's not having a fast enough effect. 

so what happens is you get people who are paying way higher prices and can't afford the basics, combined with higher borrowing rates that prevent them from consumer spending and it costs them more money to service existing debt. then you add the higher taxes that the gov't is going to have to charge one way or another. 

so consumer spending will crash, and people will cut back on every non essential. and that is a recipe for a collapse and recession. we saw this in 1983 (after the last trudeau and runaway inflation). so if history is correct - this period of unaffordability will be followed by a major economic slowdown and likely a recession in about 2 - 3 years.  

which is going to be a little shitty because that's right about when the next election is going to be held, which means if we win we inherit a horrible shit-bag of an economic disaster with insanely high debt and trashed economy - just like mulroney did. and just like mulroney if we fix it people will hate it because it means they have to go without for a while.

having things administered provincially is very important for quebeckers and it's one of the main reasons (albeit not the only one) why the ndp has had trouble making inroad in the province : it's perceived as peddling a form of federalism that is way too centralizing, which simply doesn't fly with a quebecois culture that has favored sovereignism/autonomism for a while now. the plc is also too centralizing for that matter, but the cpc is way worse for other reasons.",liberals
hh3vx9c,2021-10-17T23:46:29.000-07:00,"does canada still need a green party? i don't know if a green party is needed but in my opinion a serious grown-up green party is desirable. in the last election i had the ability to participate in ontario, in 2018, i voted for the green party of ontario and at the time it was so different from the federal greens. of course it goes without saying they are different parties, but i felt seriously bamboozled in 2019 by the gpc.

i went into the 2019 election wanting to vote green, but found both the local and national campaigns pretty insulting to conservatives. not left, not right forward, yeah sure...it was on par with the ndp in many aspects. also may completely threw pro-life greens under the bus, which is a shame because all my life i've known conservative christians/catholics who took environmental stewardship seriously, but in 2019 they felt like because they believed that a fetus was a human life, they were no longer welcome. plenty of pro-lifers have been involved in green politics throughout its history...including for a long time elizabeth may herself. i've met pro-life green candidates.

... now fast-forward to 2021 and the icing on the cake is that the greens also have a problem with respecting québec jurisdiction. annamie paul implied that yfb was a racist at the debates, and the greens were opposed to bill 21 and parts of bill 96. i'm not going to ever consider the greens again.

i feel much more comfortable with the cpc and bq. the bq has a decent environmentalist bent, and they'll have more influence than the greens anyway.

honestly, the ndp also has a decently strong environmentalist wing. if the greens go eco-socialist, they might as well just merge with em and be done with it.",conservatives

if i'm being honest, i get 4 hours of productive work done every day, max. the extra 2 hours ends up being way less productive than just working the friday. so, that's effectively 4 hours of productive work my employer lost.

i think the best compromise would be to reduce the length of the work day to 6 hours, down from 8. i get more leisure time, my employer doesn't lose productive time from me. while a 4/8 would be great for me, i suspect it would lead to less work getting done. i've read some articles that suggest the opposite, so maybe lowering stress levels makes it worth it, but i'm still skeptical.

i will deal with your points individually:

the ruger 14 is lighter:
 i'm not sure how a guns weight matters when it comes to it's ability to commit mass murder. anyone who shoots a gun will tell you that lighter rifles transfer more energy to the shooter, increasing recoil making the gun less likely to hit a target under sustained fire.

a lighter rifle won't make a difference in the shooters ability to maneuver around as the difference is usually a handful of grams. 

the ruger 14 is shorter:

you might be thinking of the mini 14, which has a collapsible stock that reduces weight and overall length, but collapsible stocks are not banned under current canadian laws and are an available upgrade for many firearms.

instead of banning one gun modification and then having to chase after innovation, canada has laws that classify guns based off of their overall length. a mini 14 with a collapsible stock would have been considered restricted if it's overall length was under 26 inches while collapsed. any restricted firearms can only be transported while locked to allowed locations, with ammunition separate. 

so it is clear that the ruger 14 being shorter or lighter is irreverent to its ability to hurt someone, nor is it unique amoung other firearms.

are you sure you read the wikipedia article you linked? it stated that the group was infiltrated in order to collect evidence. no where does it mention that they were caught because of a watch list.

all it would take to not be noticed by a watch list would be to make small purchases of explosive components mixed in with other regular good.

a couple people traveling between towns could get a lot of reaction agents without ever catching any suspicion. very few of then are regulated, and it's up to the individual company or cashier to recognize suspicious transactions. 

even if we restricted every reaction agent, all gasoline, diesel, propane. you can still cause explosions with flour, a fan, and a flare. even if we take all explosives off the table, there still exists heavy equipment, trucks, planes. 

my point is that the list is endless for a truly depraved mind set on hurting people. the only way to stop them from doing so is to have a system that prevents people from getting to that point, and identifies those that are close.

well, what if people continue to not pay attention well into october? voter motivation could be a huge factor this election, and i think this could go very awry for the lpc. 

even ignoring that older voters tend to vote cpc (and polls are for the most part showing this again), cpc voters in general tend to be more motivated and the cpc does well in lower turnout. 

gotv initiatives could be paramount, especially in the gta and greater montreal area. polls can say what ever, but if people don't actually go to vote they mean nothing.

bc has seen a spike, but it's far less than alberta, and the bc government actually _did something_ and brought back mask mandates and a vaccine card early on. it's doing pretty well in spite of the fact that the population is very old and alberta, saskatchewan, and manitoba have among the youngest populations in the country. this isn't even factoring in population density, which is absolutely a huge factor in terms of transmission.

why not quebec? look at the graph. look at where the increases in death rate came from. _most_ of it, around 70 out of that 132, occurred early in the pandemic. compare that to other provinces who didn't get hard hit early on -- they all had the benefit of that knowledge. like i said, it's shocking that they are getting their increases _now_ after all we know and the vaccines that we have. everybody is getting hit by delta but some are doing a worse job.

comparing the total rates is nonsense, is what i'm saying. look at the last few months and tell me who's managing it well. quebec has been level since the start of the year. the prairies are doing the worst, bc could have done better but isn't as bad, and they have levelled off while alberta's curve is vertical. the effects of a change in policy managing an infectious disease take weeks to see, so expect the gap in deaths between alberta and quebec to narrows considerably.",liberals

[did they though](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-mice-iduskbn2a22uw)? if that's what you're referring to then it's not the same at all and not exactly what you describe.

&gt;why do they call it experimental?

because that's what it is when it's newly used on people. that doesn't discount the animal models or human trials that have been done though.

&gt;blood clots, myocartitis, stroke, bells palsy and others would be side affects? 

well some of those aren't side effects from mrna vaccines and the ones that are, are exceedingly rare. as for myocarditis, [new research](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927) has found that what's likely happening is that rarely during an im injection you will hit a vein and administer vaccine into the bloodstream, which isn't where the vaccine should be administered. aspirating the needle stops this from happening so myocarditis is likely an error of administration, not due to the vaccine itself.

but even ignoring that, the risk of these effects is much, much greater if you get covid, so getting the shot is still much safer than not.

&gt;why did they not know the shots would lost efficacy in 6-8 months?

well i would assume because the delta variant wasn't around when the trials were done.

&gt;whether you share the same concerns or not, does not deligitimize people's concerns.

it depends on the basis for your concerns. if they aren't based in truth and fact, then it actually does delegitimize them. the biggest blunder the government has made thus far in my opinion is not educating the public about vaccines and such properly. when i said that vaccines can't cause issues many months down the road, this isn't based in opinion. there are decades of research that support this, free to be read by anyone so inclined. that mrna vaccines are new in humans doesn't change the physics and biochemistry of how vaccines are processed in the body.",liberals

hchh6z3,2021-09-11T07:44:18.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] conservativism in canada is different than conservativism in america.

there here are actually two strains of conservativism: [toryism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tory) and reformism (which originates from the [reform movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reform_party_of_canada)). 

people who adhere to traditional toryism are usually called [red tories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_tory), are usually found in the eastern provinces (especially the atlantic provinces), and were what the original progressive conservative party was filled with. they are considered to be more moderate, more paternalistic and economically interventionist, and more comfortable with big government. this ideology is what leaders such as john a. macdonald, bill davis and brian mulroney adhered to.

the reform movement is a relatively newer phenomenon and was borne from western alienation. because the west was settled by americans during the 1890s as part of the last best west immigration campaign, reform conservativism is more aligned with its american counterpart. adherents are often referred to as [blue tories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_tory) and are more likely to follow american-style conservativism of small government and neoliberalism. stephen harper, jason kenney and scott moe are typically considered to be part of this faction. the christian right also tends towards this faction, although socons are a very vocal minority within the broader conservative population.

with this in mind, it is important to note that conservativism is such a broad term in canada. in the 1990s, these factions split into the reform party/canadian alliance (blue tories) and the progressive conservatives (red tories). in 2003, stephen harper and peter mackay reunited the factions to create the current conservative party. since stephen harper is a blue tory and the majority of the party originated from the west, the cpc tended towards reform conservativism so that's why a lot of people claim o'toole is not a conservative.

however, i would argue o'toole is a red tory (despite his leadership campaign suggesting otherwise) and is trying to balance the two factions which is beginning to experience infighting. we see it on this sub even. i think o'toole realizes that red toryism is more palatable to centrists and ontario voters (look at the ontario pc party) and is trying to market the party as such.

they would be immediately booted.

that is what would happen to atwin if she did the exact same thing today as a liberal.

she would be booted and replaced with a zionist candidate just as zatzman, a temp social media advisor and lifelong liberal said.

what he said would not be controversial in any other party than the greens.

so i don't know how its 'poor caucus management', its more like an mp who had deep family roots in the liberal party being recruited by her cousin and sabotaging pauls leadership on her way out the door just like her new masters ordered her to.

i don't get how that falls on pauls leadership.

nor is it her fault that three members of the board lose their minds over being asked to take diversity training, not by paul, but on the recommendation of the former executive director who was hired before she ever became leader.

those three people are responsible for cutting off her funding, attempting to remove her as leader, wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars in court fees, firing our entire national campaign team and losing a half million dollars.

i doubt the super wealthy tax is going to get anywhere near the $60b, considering the amount of money they can hide through sophisticated tax measures. the same demographic will obviously be the ones hit through the capital gains tax and find yet again new and inventive ways to hide their money.

i would be curious to see how much they would consider putting into cra to enforce tax rules though; pursue tax cheats

i do think the $12b on tax havens though isn't too farfetched when you consider that close to $250b is hidden away on tax havens.

but: severing diplomatic relations with the holy see?  ug, that doesn't sound like a smart diplomatic choice.  the one advantage canada has re: reconciliation &amp; the church is that the current pope is more focused on helping the least fortunate, than any other pope in... well, a long time.  could pope francis help change things?  probably not, but severing ties means we give up entirely on talking with the church.

and also: for politicians interested in winning elections and governing, the political abacus of severing ties doesn't add up.  rattling our sabre at rome buys very little new credibility among canadians, and almost no new votes.  meanwhile, it sure could cost progressives (e.g.: liberals, ndp) seats in competitive ridings.

so, what to do?  i say: pour more daylight on this horrible issue.  dig into this and then tell canadians what - as far as we can tell - happened.  so: subpoenas, search warrants, ground radars, etc.  let catholics decide for themselves what they think about their church when they learn more about unmarked graves, which btw makes me mad as hell.  more daylight might also force some reckoning with the rcmp, provincial and federal governments, and even within indigenous communities.  to riff off of childish gambino: *this is (a part of) canada*.",liberals

some will argue that the rich will take their money and leave, which might not even be wrong. if they are looking at taxes on their assets, why wouldn't they move them to one of their other homes where they won't be taxed? this is why i support capital gains and income taxes for the highest earners. it's a lot harder to argue they'll take their investments and leave as we're only taxing the gains on that. it's hard to argue anyone will leave over higher income taxes if those are targeted at the super rich, because where else will you get a job making that kind of bank?

their house is elected with irv allowing the house to form major coalition governments meanwhile the senate is elected with stv and serves a fixed term which is resulted in a non partisan sentate as the government pretty much always has a minority in the senate resulting in the upper house  functioning as a check on power not just in terms of the house but also in respects to the states keeping the feds in line as each state as equal representation in their senate.",liberals

i got to experience it first-hand: i had to leave my chosen field (neuroscience) altogether thanks to harper's deep cuts to funding for climate and life sciences. deep cuts = institutional pedigree drives whether you get funding, and since i didn't go to ubc, mcgill, or u of t, my funding sources dried up. every student in the entire department where i went to grad school lost most of their scholarships and grants in a single swipe, and hiring non-adjunct profs seemed to go on perma-freeze. i had a secondary career option (software development, since i was a skilled programmer), so i chose that over a life of poverty.",liberals
