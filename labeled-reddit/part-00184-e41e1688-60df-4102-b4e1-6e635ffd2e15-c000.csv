hio63lo,2021-10-30T04:16:44.000-07:00,"questions i have for conservatives. my two cents:

**conservatism is gratitide**. people on the left tend to look at problems we have and ask how the government could fix them. my kind of conservatism takes a step back to look at the countless problems we're already solving and how our lives are vastly richer, freer, safer, and more peaceful than they were for 99.9% of human history, or in most other countries today.

doesn't mean you can't try to solve problems, but there should be a huge amount of caution applied when tampering with long-standimg social institutions.

**conservatism is acknowledging the good and the bad in human nature.** marxists, fascists, progressives and other statists imagine the perfect society and then try to hammer human nature into a shape that fits their utopia (e.g. the 'new soviet man'). anarchists and libertarians want to let human nature run wild, either because they're naive about humans being inherently good if they aren't corrupted by power structutes (chomsky) or they define humans acting according to their nature as good (ayn rand).

conservatism, imo, is about acknowledging that there is good and bad within us all, and gradually building institutions that encourage the good aspects (community, love, creativity, etc.) while tamping down or redirecting the bad ones (violence, jealousy, greed, etc.) a great example is the free market, which channels the self-interest of individuals towards socially beneficial ends. you can become a phenomenal baker that feeds a whole community purely because, when granted property rights and contract law, it serves your own interest.",conservatives

the other thing to note about the article is that repatriation of the constitution was already sucking up a ton of political and media attention in 1971. 

over the next 25 years canadians spent their time bickering over constitutional issues as standards of living collapsed. it ended with quebec’s 1995 referendum, wall street enforcing martin’s deep social spending cuts and rae days. these people did not want to cut spending! they weren’t big bad neoliberals. watch the 1990 and1993 debates. they had no option. 

what did we get for all that bickering? political and media elites’ beloved charter which quebec abrogates anytime they like, as is their right.

the 400k figures only refers to \"formal\" immigrants like myself. new permanent residents. new prs are not considered foreigners, and are considered \"domestic\" in most cases and are allowed to buy. o'toole's plan - unless his wonks also uses \"foreigners\" in less formal way - should not ban new prs to buy new houses.

as a side note, yes the word immigrant often has different meanings in each country. for us, it formally only recognises naturalised citizens and permanent resident. the term \"landed immigrant\" has been phased out because not all of us \"landed\" per se. international students and workers are not - per canada - immigrants. they are both temporary visitors. your example would fall under \"parents buying foreign temporary visitors a house\" which would be banned under his plan.",conservatives

we clearly disagree on how to make it less appealing to be landlords/investors. i happen to see the merit of banning foreign investors. reits will not exist if we follow what the austrians did. the problem is we \"stop\" at rent control alone in some places, this just means the landlords are incentivised to sell and renovict. or we let private sectors build with our taxpayer money; for them to charge high initial price and renovict later. 

we got to cap their profit, piss them off, and then fill the void by buying up their properties and building more. don't follow the plan just half-way. when provinces/feds build houses it would help to not make them look depressing too.

hiqe986,2021-10-30T15:24:37.000-07:00,"mi'kmaw to be formally recognized as nova scotia's first language i would recommend to read the introductory section of the wikipedia article on \"red tory\", as well as the philosophy and origins sections of the canada portion of the article. i'm specifying that article because red toryism is arguably the defining characteristic of canadian progressive conservatism. 
    
those portions of the article will provide a good overview, although i think the article doesn't do a great job tracing the evolution of pc thought, and as a result overemphasizes some of its earlier traits (e.g., the role of religion). one of the main things to note from the article are that the term \"red tory\" doesn't actually imply \"liberal tory\", it implies \"left tory\". 

the historical prominence of progressive conservatism is partially why canada has a history of ridings with voters who will vote either conservative or ndp ...but not liberal. to wit: one of canada's foremost constitutional scholars, eugene forsey, is often considered to have been a red tory. conservative in his legal views but socialist in his economic views, forsey was a founding member of the ccf/ndp. 

one egregious absence in the article is the lack of any discussion of edmund burke, an 18th century british-irish philosopher, economist, and politician. burke is arguably the early progenitor of progressive conservative thought, and is worth reading about if you're really keen to learn about the very roots of progressive conservatism. some canadian tories still refer to themselves as being \"burkean conservatives\".   

also, john keynes, whose economic policies form the basis of fdr's new deal--which greatly expanded the us welfare state--was also heavily influenced by the work of edmund burke. 


**addendums**        
1. a small resurgence in progressive conservative thought began (iirc) around 2015, in response to a widely circulated academic article that discussed the unique history of red toryism in canada. the reaction to this article resulted in a significant increase in progressive conservatives' social and political capital. 

2. one of nova scotia's very few political \"icons\", robert stanfield, was an archetypal progressive conservative. politically speaking, this makes it very difficult for any nova scotian conservatives to try and delegitimize the premier's progressive policies as being \"not conservative\".",conservatives

she did this to others too, where the intervener was given the floor over the initial persons point. but since trudeau as the incumbent was being posed more questions or targetted by the others, of course it would happen to him more often.

she lost control of the debate early and never really got it back. i also don't think *she* as an individual showed as much neutrality as i'd have liked. not a conspiracy theory pollster thing, but a comment that pollsters don't have the same training high quality journalists do and that she was out of her depth in the role with a 5 federal leader debate. especially with such a tight race. 

the interjections from some of the other moderators as quips or barbs back with no chance for a response was also bad. but i still think kurl's \"good answer/point\" to singh was a big problem. it's not okay to praise as the moderator one of the debaters on stage",liberals

you complained she put resources into a place there was no chance to win, but she did very well there, so i'm not seeing the issue.  there is a chance to win.

&amp;#x200b;

|victoria, other places in bc that did well in 2019 and that overlap with provincial green strength. guelph. pei ridings. beauséjour, where the greens shocked by pulling 27% last time. moncton-riverview-dieppe. we should start where there's already proof of green interest, not shoot for the moon. the goal is to reach 12 seats for official status.

so we should pull resources from the 30% place to fund the 27% place?  does that make sense?

|no, she was being truthful. she was asked to cross the floor because the liberals knew about her difficulty with paul. they used nate erskine-smith to make the point about being a big tent party and sent dominic leblanc to seal the deal. none of this would have happened if may was leader.

she wasn't, she changed her story on this multiple times, first she made it seem like she was unhappy and left, then liberals admitted they had poached her and she wanted to be in the majority power party.  she could have left for the ndp who are ideological closer, or sat as an independent.  it was a power move to get power in a traditionally strong liberal riding.

|how can you remain part of a party whose leader ignores you?

leaders of parties cannot bow down to every demand and ultimatum, especially the unreasonable one of atwin.  paul did not ignore her, in fact, by atwin's own admission she didn't accept the ultimatum so she left.

|she could have become an independent. i would have preferred that she did so. and i believe she would have won re-election as an independent, she's very popular in her riding. but she wanted to be part of a caucus to affect change.

as for inflation, that is a tougher problem to tackle, and there are many differing views. my argument is that increasing the wealth of the lower rungs will make them more innovative and entrepreneurial, and as such supply would increase and reduce the effects of inflation. additionally, as technology advances (and with the help of these new innovators) certain things, such as electricity and transport, will actually get cheaper and also reduce inflation. inflation may still occur, but not as drastically as you might think.

assuming only a minor increase, if any, in inflation when gbi is first implemented, we will have plenty of time to observe and respond to undesirable trends. 

we are guaranteed to learn a lot from gbi, and the worst that can happen is we have to repeal it and bring back the traditional benefits, so i think it's worth a shot.",liberals

also, i'm not fearmongering. i'm trying to explain the author's argument, which seemed to me to be poorly brought home. i personally have different reasons for favouring pr (giving a voice to toronto conservatives and rural alberta new democrats is important, as they may share a party but have different priorities from supporters in areas where they have a majority, and deserve a voice, for example). 

the strongest counterargument is not that fptp also has kingmaker scenarios - it does, though they are far rarer than in pr - but that the extremist kingmakers can sometimes seize power outright by taking over a mainstream party and infecting it, with partisanship leading people to quickly abandon old principles for new extreme positions. trump is the most obvious example of this, but there are others. 

a pr system mitigates the risk of this somewhat, as extremists and moderates will tend to simply form separate parties, ensuring a voice remains for dissidents and that no single extremist will ever likely hold 100% of power.",conservatives

hezup0c,2021-10-01T03:04:43.000-07:00,"trudeau spends 1st truth and reconciliation day in tofino on vacation, contradicting itinerary well, we’re all speculating , aren’t we? i’m not saying it is a mistake. i’m just saying it could be. mistakes, in my experience, are much more common. 

just trying to be logical here. you would think the pmo could anticipate bad press. who wants bad press? why would they plan to get eviscerated by the media? why would they choose to alienate voters?

let me be clear. if this was a mistake, it was a bad one. it doesn’t matter now if trudeau spent all day on the phone with residential school survivors or met in person with members of the nuu-chah-nulth in tofino. no one will believe any clarification the pmo might offer.

i have said from the start that the liberals have a terrible communications team. 

case in point: when the liberals came into power in 2015, there were 105 drinking water advisories. in six years, they dealt with 109 advisories. so specialized teams went in to 109 communities, determined the problem and the needs, worked with the community to select a site, then brought in all the equipment, supplies, and personnel to build and test a water treatment facility. by any measure, that’s an enormous success. and the liberals are still working on the new advisories which pop up regularly. but we managed to get all the way through to 2021 without seeing any success stories in the press. one story was posted after the last election and it’s theme was that it had taken 20 years - not that the liberals had successfully ended 20 years of a boil water advisory.

that’s a huge failure of communications by the liberals and not their only one.  in my opinion, had they done a better job of communicating their accomplishments, they could have won that majority. but they have let the negative press run the show.",liberals

 i would say a vote does have an expression.  electing , say, the ndp, the conservatives, the ppc, or the christian heritage party all say different things about the direction you want for the country.  a vote for the ndp says you value social programs, while a vote for  the chp says you belive in christianity.

as for the candidates, this is where people can disagree with the dissenting judges. adding uncertainty to the electoral process arguably interferes with the discourse between candidates.  constantly changing the rules of the game interferes with their discussion with each other on issues. if you don't agree, then you would have sided with the majority judges

hm4djod,2021-11-25T13:02:36.000-08:00,"liberals say they will allow provinces to ban handguns, citing rise in gun violence there are 3 elements that need to be considered here:

suicidal ideation - suicidal thoughts

suicide attempt - trying to kill yourself regardless of success

completed suicide - a successful suicide attempt

you can have a society (for example your japan point) that has cultivated a toxic culture or environment which greatly amplifies suicidal ideation and can be the main factor leading to a high number of attempts, [but low actual fatalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suicide_in_japan#suicide_sites/hotspots) (completed suicides). guns on the other hand, make it easier for suicide attempts to translate into a comparably high number of completed suicides as well. 

on top of that, [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28294383/), you can find the link between gun ownership and suicide you asked for. researchers actually argue that having less access to highly lethal means of suicide (i.e guns) through means safety strategies (ex: trigger locks, universal background checks), reduces the impact of suicidal ideation since it makes what would've been a highly easy route to death much harder, meaning ambivalent individuals are more likely to turn away or if they still try to commit suicide, lowers the likelihood of death.",liberals

for example, we could raise the target inflation from 2% (1-3%) to 3% (2-4%).  that would involve essentially the same day-to-day operations, but it would give the bank of canada more room to maneuver before hitting the zero lower bound (as present).

we could also keep a target in line with 2% inflation but change the definition slightly.  for example, we could treat the target as a crawling _price level_ target, so the price level of 20xy should be the price level of 2000 times 1.02^(xy).  that would provide more long-term price certainty, but it would require the bank of canada to offset its misses rather than let bygones be bygones.  arguably, that would have helped raise inflation expectations circa 2008 to improve the zero lower bound situation.

another thought from modern economics is to incorporate a nominal gdp level target rather than in inflation target.  this is something like the us fed's dual mandate made more explicit.  in times of rapid growth it would demand lower inflation, but in times of lower growth it would demand higher inflation and more monetary stimulus.  nick rowe (u carleton) in particular favours this target because ngdp provided the strongest signal during the 2008 financial crisis.

all of these targets would leave canada well-integrated into the global economy, and none of them look like heterodox theories such as mmt or \"hard money\" (gold standard, etc).

however, the economically-best target may not be the one the government ought to adopt for the bank of canada.  the boc's consultation materials stressed that the targets needed to be understandable as well as economically viable.  2% inflation is no longer a controversial target, so it has an enormous status quo bias behind it.  this is ultimately a political question rather than a technocratic one.",liberals

i think that's the problem.  the inflation target didn't come from the bank of canada itself, it was part of an explicitly political process in the late 80s/early 90s to bring inflation under control.

it's understandable that modern-day politicians would want to rest on those laurels, but at the same time that leaves the mandate open to future problems like the zlb and 2008 financial crisis.  a bank of canada that routinely resorts to \"extraordinary measures\" risks losing its own credibility.  the&amp;hellip; heterodox opinions about alleged \"money printing\" today are fuelled by that kind of exceptional measure.

speaking broadly, i think this is a chronic failure of the modern political (allegedly neoliberal) status quo, where we keep \"patching\" the systems of years past to address problems without revisiting their overall merits.  i see shades of the same problems with far more impactful files like veterans' affairs and aboriginal reconciliation.",liberals

let's take a moment to consider how parliamentary politics works in canada, each individual mp can -technically- vote how they choose for legislation that is tabled, however in order to pass a motion, *at least* *half* of the 338 mps (that's 169 +1) must vote in favour. the whole point of the party system that canada has developed has been to organize as many of those mps into a coherent voting block as possible, because again, mps are technically individuals who are not beholden to the parties. the only leverage parties have over individual mps is through potential support for, or against, them in a re-election campaign. majorities exist when a party is able to get at least half of the mps under a single party banner, minorities exist when no party is able to breach that 50% mark.

with that in mind, let's reconsider your comment.

&gt;how have we ended up in a place where intra-party disagreement is considered an embarrassment?

internal disagreement is not considered an embarrassment, it's an embarrassment when a party is unable to keep that internal disagreement **internal.** because it essentially shows that party leadership is unable to coherently control their mps, and if leadership can't control mps through basic policy disagreements, why would that leadership be able to control their members through a crucial vote procedure? there's a reason why the party whip has become so important in canadian parliamentary politics, keeping mps in line is critically important for passing policies and agendas. parties only have two methods to communicate their ideals with the public - through legislative action and through public statements and interactions. when the public statements and interactions look like a dumpster fire, a lot of people will also assume, understandably, that the policy and legislative efforts (arguable to more important side of things) are *also* a dumpster fire.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;to me it suggests we expect a literal 'performance' from our politicians. it's as if they are actors, whose job is to play the role of 'leader', hitting their lines and note with perfect precision

we *do* expect a performance, and leaders *are* expected to 'play a role' with perfect precision. welcome to modern politics. however, i think this is more a result of the large populations we're dealing with, and less about any specific back-room dealings or something. party leaders have the monumental task of courting large voting blocks of citizens who very frequently disagree and argue with one another. it's like a tight-rope walk, constantly trying to appease everyone while ignoring and insulting no one. to the random average voter, that tight-rope walk often comes off as disingenuous and performative, *because it is.* and yet, leaders will do it anyway because it has so far proven to be the most effective way to get your mps the votes needed to maintain power. the fact is, is that people like you and i, who think more deeply about politics and might legitimately change our vote based on this stuff are a *very* small portion of the voting population - most just don't really care.",liberals
