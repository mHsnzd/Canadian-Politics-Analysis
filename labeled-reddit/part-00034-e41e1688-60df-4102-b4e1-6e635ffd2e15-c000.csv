basically, he is a white wealthy male. so the world view that obama shook up isn’t the same viscerally as trudeau. yes he stands or represents things they hate, but at the end of the day his ordinariness or status quo nature, doesn’t make them as fearful. the old stock canadian is still in charge. if it was a woman or a minority that they kept losing too, i think it could be more dangerous for those base of people who think their canada is being taken away.

speaking to the larger media circus and all us non-green observers, this might seem a gang tackle because this is a spectacular party implosion even before ap started leveling accusations at trudeau and freeland. up until last week i don't think most of us were paying much attention besides chalking it up to the greens being a pretty fractious party that was transitioning out of being a one-woman show.  but man, now it's outright spectacle in a horrible car crash type of way.  like bernier smashing his way out of the cpc level drama.",liberals

you're saying that terms like \"angry\" and \"aggressive\" are subjective assessments, but a lot of this stuff really isn't, and frankly a lot of it seems to square up with the behaviour we've seen from her over the past week, both directly and in what's been leaked around atwin. for example, not answering emails or calls from her own mp who is trying to get in contact with her after being attacked.

like, look at the list carefully. the letter says that paul has been:

1. acting with an autocratic attitude, which they define as hostility, superiority and rejection. 
2. failing to assume her duty as an active, contributing, respective member of the federal council 
3. failing to develop a collaborative working relationship
4. failing to engage in respectful discussions and failing to use dialogue and compromise

while we can't verify whether or not she has, in fact, been skipping meetings and her behaviour in those meetings when she did attend, in the course of atwin's crossing the floor, it's been leaked that paul has failed to answer emails or calls from atwin (failing 3 and 4b), we've been told that when confronted by atwin, paul said she knew atwin was trying to reach out to her and couldn't be bothered (failing 3, again, as well as 4, as well as 1, and arguably 2 (i'm not sure if the mps are part of the federal council or not)). 

beyond her involvement with atwin, we've also seen her attack freeland, which is what this very thread is about, apparently for having the gall to even speak with atwin. yesterday we saw her criticize a reporter for his 'tone' in a question he asked. 

paul is trying to claim that these criticisms of her are motivated by a racial stereotype (or steeped in it), yet if you look at how she's behaved over this past week, as well as what we've learned about atwin's crossing, what's described in the letter is describing paul's behaviour to a *t*.  i could easily see her not listening to what other members of the council propose, just as i can easily imagine her attacking or berating other members trying to work with her. hell, just yesterday we found out that she had threatened may in the run up to the meeting.",liberals

\\-sheila copps essentially admitted that the dpm was only a ceremonial title during the chretien era, where the decisions were made by the pmo and the dpm absorbed the political fallout

this would pretty much only leave anne mclellan, whose tenure in cabinet was overshadowed by the liberal party civil war of late 90s to early 2000s, where she spent most her time in the then weaker martin camp.

the military really does seem to have a broken culture and i am genuinely curious how the gov't should fix it.

that aside, if i was a liberal strategist i'd recommend he stay on and that does appear to be what the gov't is doing as dpm freeland just came out [expressing her confidence in sajjan,](https://mobile.twitter.com/cafreeland/status/1405719547781468160) as did the gov't house leader. 

sajjan is one of the most prominent liberal sikh mps, and sacking him could influence the sikh community and lobby groups to shift their support to the ndp (who has a sikh leader) or the cpc who have several prominent sikhs.

large portions of canada's sikh community are very active in the political process and use their electoral leverage to influence policy outcomes. for example, when csis' 2019 public report was produced it mentioned a sikh (khalistani) extremist ideologies as a major terrorist threat. however, major actors within the [sikh lobby launched a massive lobbying effort] (https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/mass-lobbying-effort-launched-to-convince-goodale-to-remove-mention-of-sikh-terrorism-1.4356249) to get the liberals to remove it -- which they did. sikh community groups noted how they have a significant population mass in 30 key swing ridings. those same 30 ridings could be easily persuaded to vote for either cpc, but especially ndp with a scandal-free and charismatic sikh leader.

those 30 key ridings could shift an election if enough of those ridings portray the sacking of sajjan as either a slight or catalyst to change their voting preferences.

so if you're a liberal partisan, 100% you should advocate for sajjan staying on, it is arguably the better electoral strategy. on the other hand, if you care more about responsible government and good governance it's absolutely the inferior outcome.",liberals

i haven't made up my mind yet, but i would say i am currently a swing voter between the cpc and the bloc. i am probably leaning more toward the bloc than the conservatives at present. it isn't because i am a sovereignist, but i am definitely a québécois/fc nationalist of sorts, and i like the balance they've struck thus far between cultural conservatism, communitarianism, decentralization, environmentalism, etc. i don't feel necessarily 100% comfortable anywhere. i use the red tory monicker, mostly because it is the best thing that describes my views. also, putting one-nation conservative, in canada, seemed silly. also red toryism is a sort of made-in-canada version of it, which takes into consideration our country and it's component parts, it's traditions, etc. provincially, i quite like the caq.

a lot of the foundations of my views come from my fc upbringing, i believe, as well as my love of our food, culture, institutions, history, folklore, music, political traditions, language, and much more -- as well as my catholic upbringing (although these days i'm more of a lapsed catholic/agnostic)

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;what exactly has disheartened you (this one might be obvious)?

there is a myriad of reasons, to be honest. i'll just speak of just a few of them:

* i'm definitely more of a philosophical and classically conservative type. i'm not opposed to change but am definitely concerned about change and think it ought to be done cautiously. i certainly am not the type that wants to defund/reform everything. the conservative party of canada is a party that i find takes a more classically liberal approach when it comes time to policymaking. i'm not necessarily the laissez-faire type.
* the conservative party of canada likes to present itself as the champion of individualism. i find that hard to square with my views sometimes, as i believe a balance ought to be struck. i like burke's idea of little platoons; i'm definitely more communitarian than the average cpc member.
* i'm rather paternalistic, sometimes to a fault. it is definitely something i need to reign in on my part, but i do believe that sometimes we ought to look out for our fellow humans starting from ourselves, up to our family, to our kin, our community, city, province, so on and so forth. while there are definitely those types in the party, i find the cpc quite libertarian on a lot of issues, and very quick to call any type of the paternalistic policy being \"socialism\" or \"nanny-state\" and i find that unfortunate.
* internal politics in the party really turned me off. i had a particularly bad experience with an eda i was a part of in the ottawa area. i had been involved in grassroots politics before with a different party, but this particular eda was so divisive, so petty, and you could tell many were there for their own personal gain. i was specifically told to keep my past to myself, not speak french, and not tell anyone i am a red tory type, as i would be met with hostility. all of this was told to me by the eda president. he also tried to stack the executive with partisans of his, which i found slimy. it was a gross experience all around.
* last one i shall speak of today, is that i believe the conservative party of canada doesn't know what it wants to be. so much energy is put toward keeping their coalition together, or being anti-liberal, that what is lost is a positive *conservative* vision for the country, and when i say conservative, i don't mean *classically liberal*.

there are a lot of others, but i'll keep it to those for now. feel free to ask any follow-up questions, if you would like.",conservatives

because ~~not-~~green stuff is cheaper under a carbon tax. (ed: had it backwards as a relic of an earlier draft)

that's the small-c-conservatism of the carbon tax plan: customers don't need to know or care what the \"green\" option is.  the cheapest and most effective options _are_ the green options under a carbon tax.

shopping for a bargain becomes shopping for the environment.  likewise, \"hidden\" emissions between otherwise identical products show up in price &amp;ndash; something shipped by truck from the opposite coast would have more carbon tax built into its shipping cost (and thus retail price) than an equivalent produced locally.

* if the uk is seeing a 3rd wave (as others have pointed out, their cases have dropped like a rock since vaccination took hold), given their much higher rate of vaccination, what are canada's plans if vaccination does not work out? all we know is that most canadians that want a vaccine will be vaccinated by september. we assume that's a good thing, but it's just a statistic that we are being led to believe is good without a narrative around it.

it worked. nobody noticed the $400 payroll tax credit or the one year increase in the alternative minimum tax floor. the democrats got annihilated in the 2010 midterms and basically no major stimulus would be passed until the trump tax cuts. the republicans successfully argued that the government had spent 800 million dollars and no one felt any better off. the short-term focus on maximizing economic efficiency undercut the political argument for further action. the recovery from the recession was much slower and more painful than it needed to be, and we saw the rise of really ugly anti-system politics.",conservatives

&gt; i don't think your moral views are easily described as \"traditional\" 

then you are mistaken.  

and it's because you're making the mistake of assuming that a belief that something is immoral means that the person also wants it to be illegal.   in the case of lgbtq rights, you're conflating a moral position with a legal one on rights.  i gave the example earlier of cheating on a spouse as an example of something which many people would see as deeply immoral and yet would see obvious (and more serious) problems with making it illegal.

**************************
have you read c.s. lewis' non-fiction?  specifically, \"mere christianity\"?  i highly recommend it if you want to understand christianity better.  the book was originally a series of \"lectures\" for lack of a better word on the radio, so they make for some very easy reading.

here's what he has to say about marriage.  he is speaking on the subject of divorce but as i'm sure you'll notice, if you simply replaced divorce with gay marriage, the argument is unaffected.

&gt; “i should like to distinguish two things which are very often confused. the christian conception of marriage is one: the other is the quite different question--how far christians, if they are voters or members of parliament, ought to try to force their views of marriage on the rest of the community by embodying them in the divorce laws. a great many people seem to think that if you are a christian yourself, you should try to make divorce difficult for every one. i do not think that. at least i know i should be very angry if the mohammedans tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine. my own view is that the churches should frankly recognize that the majority of the british people are not christians and, therefore, cannot be expected to live christian lives. there ought to be two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the state with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the church with rules enforced by her on her own members. this distinction ought to be quite sharp, so that a man knows which couples are married in a christian sense and which are not.”

this is my point.  i've met people who are outspokenly \"pro-choice\" and yet will also (with disgust) refer to some abortions as \"straight up baby murder\".   (that's a quote.)   

opposition to abortion takes many forms for different people.  i do oppose many abortions.  some call me a social conservative because of that, others (like you) don't.

stereotype much?   this is like saying that abolitionists were only interested in \"imposing their morality\" on others.   it's absurd.

no it is not.  

&gt; conservative movements - not just in canada - have been villifying anything that looks like an enviromental policy for too long.

there's a few reasons for this.   the first is a reaction to environmental activists tying tangentially related issues into \"green\" activism.   when \"anti-capitalist\" becomes tied in with environmental activism it drives away people who oppose anti-capitalist.     basically, \"environmental\" got lumped in with a lot of other issues.   

the second reason is unique to the canadian political context.   elizabeth may worked for the minister of environment in the progressive conservative government of brian mulroney.   mr. mulroney was suspicious of here, but told his minister of environment that she was his responsibility.   and then she was caught feeding cabinet confidences to a network of activists who used the information against mr. mulroney's government.  or to put it more bluntly, elizabeth may got caught spying to undermine a conservative government and no conservative party is ever going to trust her or any group associated with her ever again.

the third of course is costs to businesses.  most environmental action drives up costs for businesses which will lead to many businesses opposing the action.  in the lpc this led talking the talk and then not actually doing anything.  (see kyoto).  in the case of the cpc this led to the same thing, except they were far, far, far more transparent in doing so and really kind of sucked at talking the talk.",conservatives

not really. it’s the reason republicans in the u.s give for wanting to limit abortion. many conservative politicians here are religious and openly sympathize with them. i’ve never heard a conservative politician in canada say they want to limit abortion because of “sexism” so why should i assume that is the reason? i’m basing my assertions on my own observations. 

**and like i said, it’s about morality and rights. putting restrictions on abortion limits a women’s right to choose. having liberal abortion laws doesn’t take away rights from anyone. those who are morally opposed to abortion can always choose to abstain from it.**

not all social conservatives believe the same thing of course, but i don’t think it would be unreasonable say that much of the conservative opposition to abortion comes down to religion. liberalism and conservatism is a spectrum. you seem more conservative on abortion than many people but also more liberal on abortion than many people. canada’s abortion laws are extremely liberal and most canadians seem fine with that. that’s why i’m saying if the conservative party runs with an overly conservative platform on abortion, it’s going to have a harder time than if it took a neutral stance. again, i’m basing my assertion on my own observations (polling).",conservatives

there are about 2 million legal gun owners in canada. that's not an insignificant chunk. those people aren't the ones who commit gun crimes. most gun violence is gang related in canada, and in many cases gun crimes usually have sentences reduced by judges. 

in 2019 canada had 678 homicides total, and 261 (2 of 5) were committed with firearms. almost 1 in 4 of the 678 homicides were gang related. 

in contrast, fatalities from impaired driving are estimated from just over 1000 (transport canada) up to 1500 (madd) in canada every year. that almost to well over double of our total homicides, and well over double of firearm related homicides.

is banning alcohol or drugs ever considered to reduce those deaths? no. do we have laws and legislation to enforce impaired driving regulations and reduce fatalities? yes. now, do we have laws and legislation to enforce gun regulations and reduce misuse and fatalities? yes. then why do we consider bans for one of thing but not the other, especially when one has a higher lethality rate? transport is essential yes but drinking isn't, so why not ban it? for many people hunting is essential and is a far more affordable and ethical way of harvesting meat for consumption, and protecting livestock and crops from pests is essential for farmers. for others shooting is a competitive sport and hobby, and is heavily regulated and safety is paramount. by banning or restricting specific actions or classifications of firearm sport shooting is gone, competitions are gone, multiple jobs and companies and livelihoods are gone, and the cost of reimbursement is astronomical. 

essentially my point is legal firearm owners should not be the targets of modern gun control legislation as we are rightfully already under heavy scrutiny for background and criminal record checks, and subject to many restrictions we follow to the letter to continue our hobby, sport, and hunting practices. border control, gang activity, illegal smuggling, and loophole plugging should be the methods pursued to curb gun violence as they will be the most effective.

how can murphy call others arrogant after vomiting up this word-salad? this article has it all: philosophical masturbation, a contrived dialogue, and red baiting. the only thing missing is any sort of explanation of what c-10 is or the problem's with it. all this tells you that it is \"democracy-denying\", whatever that means.

the restriction of free speech has gotten so bad, that thankfully 150 intelligent academics signed the famous harper’s letter, which decried the weakening of public debate and warning that the free exchange of information and ideas is in jeopardy amid a rise in what they call \"illiberalism.\" these signatories hail from american universities such as princeton, yale, harvard law, brown, rutgers and more. j.k. rowling, salman rushdie and margaret atwood are among dozens of writers, artists and academics to argue against ideological conformity in an open letter in harper's magazine.

the names hail from a host of different sectors, from cognitive scientist noam chomsky to activist gloria steinem, jazz great wynton marsalis to chess grandmaster garry kasparov to randi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers.

this sums the letter up well:

\"the way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away,\" the letter said. \"we refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other.

the left simply doesn’t agree with this and the outrage about this letter was horrific, which shouldn’t be surprising.",conservatives

he's not an andrew scheer, we all know this by now, writers can stop comparing them, it's old and unproductive. the next big question is to ask with a different tone, *who is o'toole*

the problem there is, bc politics are different than federal politics. the narrative that media, or angus reid is biased against trudeau is not something that began last night, so when she challenged trudeau, that was enough evidence  or a lot of partisans to solidify their opinion the debate was rigged.

no clue. i felt he didn't do well but he did as well as he could given the format and the challenges he faced from all angles. 

i think o'toole managed to pivot very well and keep his message short and concise (even if he did stretch the truth very significantly about the house tax thing and a few other small comments). he managed to avoid being the object of attack, kept the heat on his primary opponent and kept out of the left leaning parties squabbling with each other. which is exactly what he had to do last night. i don't think he was a good debater, but since there was little real debate, he adapted best to the format and used it to his advantage.",conservatives

in 2006 *an inconvenient truth* came out, and climate started getting added to the list of progressive issues. for however much that is a haves vs have-nots matter, it's unsurprising that this became a further policy issue, and that it pushed conservative parties further right economically.

hdz8jan,2021-09-23T02:05:47.000-07:00,"liberal candidate in vancouver granville declared the winner 2 days after 2021 federal election i will preface that i’m not a fan of taleeb. i’ve met him before and he was a bit arrogant. i don’t know him personally and it could just be my perspective, but that was my first and only impression so it stuck with me. 

that said, i think folks underestimated just how liberal this riding is. this was the best showing the ndp has ever got. many folks changed their vote in response to the house flipping. 

at the end of the day, sometimes it comes down to policy. if a candidate in rural alberta has a scandal (many have), not everyone is going to flip their vote. i suspect many voters of his made a hard choice in this riding and had to plug their nose while voting.

folks sometimes forget just how liberal the lower mainland is because there are so many swing ridings. but on a whole, the lpc captured ~36% of the vote across vancouver and suburbs, despite the liberals getting the lowest share of the vote in the last 3 elections. many folks who own homes but want action on climate and a more inclusive society, and just don’t want the ndp ~~‘socialism’. (i’m not using this negativity, the word still appears in the party’s purpose)~~ wealth redistribution. 

the vancouver granville riding includes all or significant portions of the kerrisdale, marpole, oakridge, shaughnessy, south cambie, and fairview. for folks who don’t know vancouver, the former half are not the areas which are going to be receptive to wealth redistribution, but many in the area care deeply about the environment.",liberals

hell, even the ppc isn't trying to cover up their dirty laundry by saying one thing and doing a complete nother.

even the god damn bloc quebecois is more open about how they don't care about governing canada they just want power in quebec. i expect bloc voters wouldn't be too happy if the bq started trying to gain ground in other provinces.
