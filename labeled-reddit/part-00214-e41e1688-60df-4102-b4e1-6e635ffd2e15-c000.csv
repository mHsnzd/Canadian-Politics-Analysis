the leading theory as to what is causing the rare instances of blood clots in both the j&amp;j and astrazeneca vaccine is the adrenovirus vector that is used to deliver the gene to elicit an immune response from the body. this virus is suspected of triggering an immune response to factors found on the surface of platelets, which are an essential part of the clotting process. this activates platelets, causing clots, and at the same time reduces the total platelet count. 

because of these contradictory changes related to your body's clotting mechanisms, it is actually extremely dangerous to be using normal approaches to treating blood clots; normal treatment would target the likelihood of blood clots forming, but the low platelet count in the first place could mean a massively increased risk of internal bleeding if you proceed with traditional treatments.",liberals

more seriously though, any service that comes to be known for porn should just clone itself and move any creators onto the cloned, porn-free branded version of the same platform. 

but for politics, i'm afraid that the only real recourse on a lot of these cases is the courts. the courts tend to act with greater boldness than politicians, at least outside of the states, where we have more moderate, less politically-driven courts. 

with subject matter that is politically charged, it's really impossible to get politicians to make evidence-based laws, lest they appear \"soft\" or excessively \"sympathetic\" to those who are most affected. in my estimate, any topic where fewer than 5% of politicians would admit to doing or experiencing it, if otherwise taboo, is going to get treated as evil rather than as part of the human condition or natural variation in experience, tastes, etc... 

to put it concretely, i couldn't imagine scott brison ever admitting to an enjoyment of extreme gay stuff even if he genuinely did enjoy it. just too much taboo around the topic. and if he were to merely defend it in parliament, there would be tons of innuendo suggesting \"oh, he must secretly be into that kind of stuff\".

hey7k1i,2021-09-30T17:21:21.000-07:00,"the election would have looked much different with proportional representation nice article. there is one missing issue with the simulation of pr. the political parties would be different. 

in europe where pr is mostly used, there are around 6 to 15 parties represented in the national assemblies. it is very rare for any party nowadays to get above 30%, which didn’t use to be the case. polarization is affecting pr as well with governing coalitions becoming increasingly diluted of ideological content.

for example, there is no way ndp will remain the most lefty party, so this idea that pr would benefit ndp is non-obvious. rather one or two far-left worker’s party or european light-communist parties would appear. with quebec in the mix, some josé bové or jean-luc mélenchon like character may also jump into the mix to collect some 3-8% vote share. and i suspect the conservative party will again split into a red tory, blue tory, reform party parties, and nowadays of course there is also populist right-wing parties. they may again reunite in practice, though not on paper, when it is time to create a majority coalition for the government.

maybe this is a feature and not a bug of pr, one can debate that. my point is just that trying to infer outcomes of pr in an election with political parties that have evolved to compete in a fptp system is foolish. i agree with the title, the election would have looked much different, but in what way it would be different i doubt can be projected as easily as suggested.",conservatives

there are very concrete plans developed by teams of economists and engineers. i did point you at them and i can point you at more, but you aren’t interested in actually understanding, so there is no artifact that you wouldn’t dismiss out of hand.

it doesn’t make sense to decarbonize every industry at the same time. there are tons of people like you dragging their feet so we need to start with the low hanging fruit, which is to stop increasinf our emissions. agricultural emissions are basically flat. oil and gas are soaring. so of course we should focus on oil and gas first.

hand waving at the industry that is harder, and not growing is just a way of ensuring nothing happens. if we decide to tackle agriculture seriously you’d be complaining how silly it is to do ag first when all of the emissions are coming from o&amp;g.

&gt; for example canada just made it possible to drive across the entire country with an electric car. like it just became possible last week.  what kind of bottle necks and line ups would exist if everyone had an electric car? 
so what you are saying is that the government has been criminally negligent in building the infrastructure needed for the transition we need to make. i agree 100%. stringing chargers along the major highways is really not very difficult and in fact is dramatically easier than it was to build the gasoline infrastructure in the first place. that we haven’t done it properly yet is a massive failure of leadership.


&gt; how many of these electric car stations are powered by diesel generators?  

virtually none? perhaps a few in nunavut? diesel is a minimal part of canada’s energy mix. less than 1%.

the fact that you are picking on these minuscule gaps and blowing them out of proportion just shows that you aren’t serious and are just looking for an excuse to naysay.

&gt; are there electric transport trucks that do the same thing? or is just town cars that can make it across the country right now?

what we can do right now is not the important question. we cannot change the past. the question is “what are we doing today so that the future is better?” 

are we building pipelines or solar farms?

are we building electrical chargers or digging oil sands mines?

pointing out that the country is ill equipped to move away from fossil fuels today is hardly a revelation. we are a petrostate full of climate denialists and fatalists.

&gt; i'm all for developing this tech, but when politicians say \"oil is dead\" while boarding private jets and refusing to answer questions about the practical application of green energy, it quickly becomes evident how much of a farce this alarmism is.

that sentence does not hang together logically. the danger of our situation is dictated by molecules in the air, not by human reactions to the situation. looking to politicians to decide whether to be alarmed makes no sense whatsoever. you need to look to the science and then elect the politicians with the courage to act on the basis of it.

&gt; then when someone asks a simple question about agriculture (where food comes from) you reply

we can worry about agriculture later

you didn’t ask a simple question about agriculture. you picked a sentence out of a page to try and generate a “gotcha”

“how will we decarbonize the agricultural sector” is a simple question in the same way that “how will we win world war 2” is a simple question. 

either you are lying when you say you think it is a simple question or you are dumb. your pick.

it can’t be answered in a reddit comment except by reference to a complex plan created by agriculturists, engineers and economists. i know you won’t read any such document when i provide it, because you aren’t serious about wanting to solve problems. what you want to do is stand in the way of other people solving them.",liberals

the ultimate test is that if conservatives believe in climate change and really comprehend the consequences and causes they have to be willing to *do* something to avert it. [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2offzvnhky) certainly are ( though a more concrete counter-proposal from the conservative would be a hell of a lot more convincing ) but the party as a whole's first answer to what the plan is, is to tell canadians that it's not a carbon tax. that suggests to me that a fair number of conservatives are going along to get along in rhetorically staying away from outright denialism instead of really taking climate change as a serious problem.

they're certainly not the only political entity that has this problem, german greens in many respects end up resembling them by being unwilling to take climate change seriously and see that whatever their objections to nuclear power it's downright criminal to shut them down before germany gets off coal because any serious assessment of the damage that climate change will cause quickly outstrips the most radical fever dreams a green has about nuclear power.

now with every day that goes by without o'toole releasing a climate plan ( imho he should have been working on that since he won leadership and probably released it in the fall ) it looks more and more like the cpc's approach to climate change is to have some effective rhetoric to cover a weakness instead of a credible plan that they're determined to implement to reduce canadian emissions.",conservatives

trudeau's approach is clearly an electorally-successful one. despite not being a particularly popular pm, party, or government (lost popular vote twice, etc), the liberals have targeted and identified their support base and turned them out consistently. it's an electorally-efficient coalition of voters that can deliver government with relative ease, but a majority is very difficult.

i think trudeau could win a majority if he was, well, more popular. goes without saying that passing popular policies and avoiding fuckups like tofino would help to that end. but it seems to be that trudeau and his team have identified a niche that fits the circumstances, and im not sure what chrétien and the old guard could offer beyond that.",liberals
