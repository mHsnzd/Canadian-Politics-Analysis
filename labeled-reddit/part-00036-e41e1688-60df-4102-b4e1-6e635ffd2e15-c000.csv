the irony here is great because fred delorey ran in central nova in 2015 - where he was promptly destroyed by sean fraser.

if they actually want to win back their former stronghold, mckay would be their best bet against a popular fraser.

&gt; “if we were five or 10 points ahead in the polls, you wouldn’t be hearing any of it,” 

what’s interesting is a np article had a source that stated that o’toole’s team was confident in their numbers - they even presented them to caucus to try and get others on board (that should tell you how morale is there btw). yet, not one public poll shows anything good for them.

it’s similar to when scheer declared that they were on track for a majority government just before the election - a weird move that embarrassed them come election time.

there's a place for social conservatism if it adapts, but that means a) letting go of some issues and b) engaging other issues in different ways than what they've done in the past. same for conservatism more generally. 

federally, as long as the party is basically a regional bloc trying to dictate national policy, it won't survive. provincially, the wing of the opc is just used for votes and nothing else. if they want policy changes, they have to be thoughtful in how they engage some of these issues.",conservatives

i don't rhink e-mails like this would be tolerated in a judges office or even the conservative party  these days.

\\&gt; this needs to be made a political issue rather than punted off to a judge who doesn't care and will not do anything.

you would be wrong there. it';s not appropriate for politicians to interfere politically in criminal investigations, let alone non-criminal ones like in the case of vance's e-mails. this is especially true of a liberal when dealing with harper loyalists embeded in the system like walbourne and vance. politicians motivated by partisanship are way worse at getting justice than judges and the courts. it is political interference from harper loyalists that is the main reason all these investigations of vance are being shut down. walbourne knows that sajjan's involvement and political interference in this would kill all investigatiosn and the ability to punish vance for his actions. 

it comes down to this though: do you think  a harper appointee like vance is going to get fairer treatment from a liberal like sajjan or a judge? do you think he's going to get fairer treatment from a harper appointee like walbourne or a judge? those are the relevant questions here. i think someone like louise arbour will be a much suitable arbiter of justice than these two guys.",conservatives

well, when people take on debt under the assumption that government will later cancel it. if we cancel debt for education, i can easily see that same argument later being made for other forms of debt.

this is precisely why there is debt though. if you can't pay, you pay it off over time. now, if you want to argue for free college going forward, that's a different argument than making it free for those who attended in the past.

&gt;student debt is far from concentrated in children of the rich, who have the ability to get funding from their parents. 

it is irrelevant. it's concentrated in a segment of the population who statistically are going to do quite well in their careers. we have doctors with hundreds of thousands in debt who frankly do quite well. how well their parents do is irrelevant - they are still very well off. we have lawyers in the same position - lots of debt but still well off. overall, the people who have student debt, by definition are highly educated and highly skilled. it is odd to focus welfare on this type of group, and it's odd to me to see them being painted as a victim almost.",conservatives

&gt;really??? you're saying that looking up a definition in a dictionary (or four) is an argument from authority?

if you claim it as an exhaustive and exclusive authority on the use of language, yes. 


&gt;that is literally the job of a dictionary- to be an authoritative source.

even the authors of dictionaries would not agree with your characterization. again, for the dictionary to add words and be altered or expanded definitions every year requires someone to be using words differently to how the dictionary prescribes.

if the dictionary were authoritative thered be no need for things like the urban dictionary. and of course slang would be strictly criticized as antithetical to communication. 

&gt;definitions form the basis of commuication. if we're discussing house pets and you decide that 'cat' means 'armadillo', no wonder that confusion will ensue.

no, usage and mutual understanding is the basis of communication. dictionaries catalog the result of usage. thats why dictionaries change over time. they are reactive, not prescriptive. 

you are arguing against the explicit mission of actively published dictionaries. this is not the 19th century anymore. we don't treat language like a eugenics project. 


&gt;look - you asked for an academic source and i gave you *four*

you gave no academic source justifying your characterization of the motives behind those using that term. the dictionary obviously doesnt say that woke liberals are trying to deceive us all. you have yet to show this is believed by anyone beyond you. 

and again apparently you think the economists and policy makers and corporate financiers who know what it means arebin on the woke disinfo campaign?

extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.


&gt;the think tanks that are pushing this narrative *are not stupid*.

which think tanks? who? why? prove your conspiracy. pointing to the dictionary just proves you don't even understand how language works. 


&gt;in 1984, the purpose of newspeak was to make non-sanctioned viewpoints difficult to express.

lol. when reactionaries appropriate 1984 it's always a bad sign for society.

you're the one who is closer to what the party was doing with new speak by denying the validity of certain words, and demanding that a central authority in the dictionary guide your perception so that people who are critical of particular state policies can be understood.

how fucking insane is it that you argue 1984 is on your side when you're embodying an authoritarian view of language. 

and you're serious too, it's amazing.

so they're only being (semi-)definitive on existing structures, while being ambiguous on federal lands. so some office buildings will be turned into apartments and federal land may still get developed. at least the offices are almost guaranteed to be located in population centres where people can efficiently get to work.

&gt; encouraging canadians to invest in rental housing by extending the ability to defer capital gains tax when selling a rental property and reinvesting in rental housing, something that is currently excluded; and

i find it difficult to believe that deferring tax payments will help reduce the cost of living. also, *invest* implies for-profit plans. a major issue driving the cost of housing up is investment. so if the conservatives intend on providing blanket support for housing investments i have to assume they will only make the problem worse. need more details on that before i could ever not oppose their strategy

i think the real incentives have to be set at the level of creating purpose built rentals in some way. this could be by way requiring a certain number or % of rental units for every development area and then also making these rental units \"affordable\" by tying them to some sort of income measure (that should be lower than the median income because median can afford in a healthy system to try and buy for example). 

how to get that done from the fed level would have to include some sort of incentive program in taxes or preferential borrowing rates from a centralized fund, or by giving a special transfer to municipalities that institute such measures etc. 

but the federal level needs to pull levers that incentivize the places that have the real policy options to implement them. i don't think any sort of true direct spending solution exists for this, unless the federal government creates a department of housing and this department actually builds homes. they could maybe fund the cmhc to do that but the cmhc being arm's length would end up probably operating under a sort of cost recovery model and i don't know that they'd really be able to compete as a developer with existing developers for things like land acquisition etc. 

and if that's what the cpc plan about federal land is related to, i don't know what federal land could be used to alleviate the issue in cities where this is most acutely felt - i doubt people would be happy with selling off park land or historic sites, etc. i don't think there's much undeveloped federal land that isn't some sort of green space",conservatives

why this is an issue is because the oic is typically and historically used for one of two things: 

1. appointing officiants, etc. stuff that doesn’t require rounds of parliamentary approval because you’re appointing a new minister somewhere. 

2. wartime measures which need to be taken immediately due to a frozen, stalled or broken parliament. 

what the lpc did was purely to score political points and was theatre at its best. it was, at its core using the ns massacre as a way of saying: “this needs to be done now!” even though there was sufficient evidence to suggest that any and all weapons used during the course of the massacre didn’t come from canada, except from the hands of a dead officer. as is, this ban up to this date has not done a single thing but criminalize existing firearm owners and hurt firearms retailers. everybody who owned these firearms still have them and there’s no evidence to suggest mass shootings were stopped bu the ban. 

there should have been legislation introduced and it should’ve been passed through parliament with the appropriate experts discussing it. the use of an oic for a massive blanket ban like this is not normal, nor should we accept it as normal because it sets a horrible precedent for what other governments in the future can do with the oic with regards to our freedoms and privileges as canadians.",liberals

the first year after choosing a new leader is *always* tumultuous for a party, and paul hasn't evidently caused any more turmoil than what most parties usually experience in similar situations.

&gt;paul has lost 1/3 of the green mps to the liberals and alienated the other two.

sure - the one mp who defected won her seat in the first place through an odd vote split and likely saw the writing on the wall so far as what was needed to retain her seat going forward. of the other two, one is the former party leader who seems unwilling to step out of the spotlight. the test for a party that small isn't \"what do the existing three mps think?\" but rather \"what are you doing to get ready in places where you don't have seats?\" the only question of real importance is whether paul would herself be capable of winning a seat in the upcoming election.

&gt;if the party enters the election divided it may fare worse than if it has a brand new or even interim leader.

but that's just it - there's no outcome here that doesn't divide the party further. leadership votes are the single most divisive moments in the life of a party. and - more to the point - they *just* had one of those, and the result was that they elected paul! so to an outsider this looks like fractious warfare internal to the party - not a mark of a serious electoral contender.",liberals

funny enough if it wasn’t for s. 33 there would not be a charter at all. the provinces would not otherwise have agreed to enact it out of concern that it effectively shifted law-making power from elected bodies to the courts. s. 33 was a last minute addition to bring the provinces on board. look up the kitchen accord if you’re interested.",liberals

quebec and canada can and should go their own way, and reap the benefits:

1) freer trade. as independent parties to nafta, we'd have far freer trade than under the restrictive interprovincial regime we have now. also, if regionalism and draconic obsessive jurisdictional jealousy were not so dominant, all sorts of important reforms become possible - federal free trade, federal old age security, etc. etc.;

2) better financial regulation (for anglo canada). canada is not allowed to even have an opt-in federal securities regulator because quebec. 

3) freedom to pursue our priorities and amend our respective constitutions. 

4) a better and more representative supreme court and federal civil service. our current system prioritizes bilingualism above all else. this puts serious barriers up when it comes to promoting on merit in the civil service or having a diverse supreme court.

however, the ford government’s use of s.33 in this instance is definitely not that time or place. disallowance, imo, should only be used on provincial laws that would severely damage the national interest and also can’t be saved by other means (ie the courts, federal pogg legislation, policy interventions within federal jurisdiction, etc.). there should be a *national* interest in disallowing a provincial law.

https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2018/nordhaus/facts/

his work literally showed how carbon pricing (cap and trade or taxes) could reduce emissions.  and that is what he won the nobel prize for.

&gt; and where did it work? certainly not in canada - it was a failure of epic propotions in bc

i never get this argument. bc saw substantial population and economic growth during the period which it had a carbon tax.  and yet emissions remained flat and have started declining.  and that's at $20/tonne that bc had for most of that period.

as for jurisdictions where they've worked, i would put up the eu ets as an example of effective reduction:

https://www.pnas.org/content/117/16/8804

&gt; but - let me remind you the liberals have regularly missed their stated targets by miles again and again and again for the last 30 years. so - if you're giving them the benefit of the doubt then you really don't give a shit about the environment, you just care about being lied to about it nicely.

it's going to take more than rhetoric to win my vote.  i prefer to see plans. and non-partisan analysis.  

to be fair, i do take the issue more seriously than most.  i completed a graduate certificate in energy and climate studies, at an american service academy, while on a military academic exchange (on my free time while doing the training i was sent down for).  so i'm probably a bit more concerned with this than the average muggle.  but i do think you're really going to have a tough time convincing moderates if all you throw at them are accusations of gullibility and insults.  that didn't work in 2015 or 2019, for the cpc either.  i would hope the party has learned from past mistakes.

&gt; but it is entirely fair to say \"whatever plan you're talking about - show me the reductions and the target dates for it\". it shouldn't be nebulous - it should be clear. 

and this is what i want to part with the carbon tax.  and i suspect a lot of other moderates too.

a firm timetable with interim goals.  not some 2050 bullshit.  targets that are a decade out with interim goals that the government will deliver during their time in office.  the kind of smart goals that your boss expects at work.  honestly, if he commits to full decarbonization of the grid and a firm new icev ban by 2035, with interim targets for 2025 and 2030, i'd be onboard.  incidentally those are actually biden's targets in the us too.",liberals

in ontario's case though, there's not much they can do, unless del duca absolutely blows the competition away in the debates and subsequent campaigning (which i'd say is fairly unlikely since del duca comes across as fairly dry and uncharismatic). the memory of mcguinty/wynne is also probably still too fresh for a come from behind win next election and horwath, while seemingly unsuccessful at unifying anti-ford sentiment around her seems to be the more popular opposition leader and is doing more to get her party's brand out there. the liberals by contrast have been much more quiet from what i can gather as somebody outside of ontario.",liberals

if you're going to take that definition - then rebates are the same, and so all of the money returned from the carbon tax is also 'gov't spending'.  can't have it both ways. 

&gt;his work literally showed how carbon pricing (cap and trade or taxes) could reduce emissions.

well no. have you read it? and that's not what he won the nobel prize for. from your own quote,

&gt;prize motivation: \"for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis.\"

so - when you say 'the carbon tax won a nobel prize\" - it did not. at all. at best you can say a guy who won a prize for some different work also produced some theory modeling carbon taxes. 

and as we've seen in bc - he was not right. his assumptions took into account a certain 'elasticity' for energy consumption by people which has turned out not to be nearly as high as he had thought. 

&gt;i never get this argument. bc saw substantial population and economic growth during the period which it had a carbon tax. and yet emissions remained flat and have started declining

well that would be a blatant lie, wouldn't it. emissions are not flat at all, they're increasing steadily. the population increase was factored into the original plana. remember - the plan was to reduce emissions by 30 percent from where they were. that's what the economic models suggested was possible. well - they didn't reduce emissions at all - emissiond dipped sharply due to the great recession, and as soon as that was over and the recovery started they shot back up to higher than the pre-tax levels and kept right on climbing. so much so that environmental groups such as the sierra club have been screaming that more needs to be done. 

so your statement is virtually entirely false. other than population did increase a small amount, which was planned for. 

the best analysis is that the carbon tax may have slowed growth by between 5 and 10 percent. but that is only a tiny fraction of what it was supposed to do. 

so if you \"don't undrestand\" ... i dont know what to tell you other than the math is extremely clear - it failed. 

&gt;it's going to take more than rhetoric to win my vote. i prefer to see plans. and non-partisan analysis.

well you can count the liberals out then. we'll see what the cpc puts forward. but honestly - you kind of sound like you have a bit of a moving goalpost on what the facts are. 

&gt; i completed a graduate certificate in energy and climate studies, at an american service academy, while on a military academic exchange 

great - another 4 years and a decade or so of experience and you'd be qualified to analyze a plan  :) you were closer to being realistic when you said we should demand results vs timelines. in the end, that's all that matters because there's no guarantee either party will actually do what they say the 'plan' is in any case. god knows the liberals have not.  the cpc has not broken its word on climate promises so much - but it also hasn't said it would do anything so really not much track record there to rely on. 

all we can really do is say \"fine - you say your plan will result in x by y date - do it and we'll hold you accountable if you don't\". 

&gt;so i'm probably a bit more concerned with this than the average muggle.

quite likely - and in all seriousness that's great. we do need people for whom this is a very serious issue. and while i have studied this fairly deeply i'm no where near as expert as people who, like yourself, consider it a serious matter of study. 

but economics i do know. and i can tell you the carbon tax does not work. everyone thought it would - hell the cpc backed it for a number of years if you'll recall - but it doesn't. 

oh - and it was 'revenue neutral' for about 4 years - then it wasn't any more. which is exactly what would happen here. 

&gt; but i do think you're really going to have a tough time convincing moderates if all you throw at them are accusations of gullibility and insults

true, true - but in teh end i don't really care what you believe. the fact is its almost impossible to get people to take an honest look at the facts as it is. seriously - you thought the carbon tax was working in bc. the facts are clearly different. i don't mean that as a personal attack btw - i really don't - but it is a strong indicator that despite your interest you've allowed some species of bias to influence you. 

so - if you like, yo go ahead and vote liberal despite their constant track record of failure on this issue. when the economy tanks and austerity measures have to be put in place and things you care about get trashed please remember this conversation. my personal situation is such that i'll be just fine either way. but understand - if you fuck it up, then the blowback against any climate change spending or initive will go out the window and people will be sick of it. so be very sure this is the hill you want to die on if it's important to you.",liberals

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; the government likewise negotiated slowly and [poorly](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-drug-makers-resist-ottawas-pleas-for-more-covid-19-vaccines-before/) with pfizer-biontech and moderna, accepting an excessively pessimistic premise that large quantities of vaccine would neither be ready nor deliverable before april, leaving ottawa startled when injection season wound up kicking off in december.

&amp;#x200b;

first off, in the preceding sentences, it blames our woes on our attempted collaboration with cansino and \"china bad\" despite there being zero evidence that it affected any other part of our procurement.  in fact, it's been documented that the canadian government knew very quickly that that partnership was in trouble, so the idea that it would lag in looking elsewhere for vaccines because it was counting on a nrc - cansino partnership that it already knew was in serious trouble lacks common sense and any evidence...

secondy, define slowly.  canada was the first country to sign an advanced procurement agreement with moderna.  they were the 4th to sign with pfizer.  if they were to mention astrazeneca, they'd maybe have a point, but alas, that's not as sexy given astrazeneca's current issues.  in fact, in terms of when we signed agreements it seems like we backed all the right horses in the right order, outside of the nrc-cansino partnership (which has previously successfully worked on an ebola vaccine).

secondly, no evidence is that canada 'accepted' an excessively pessimistic premise.   it was told by the vaccine makers that large quantities wouldn't be available until q2.   pointing to us or even uk (in terms of pfizer -- though they are currently relying much more on astrazeneca, they do indeed have a bigger supply of pfizer) as proof that larger quantities were available misses the point that they, us especially, are the reason why the drug makers couldn't promise canada (or the eu) significant quantities in q1.    moderna for example expected to make 120 million or so vaccines in the first quarter.   100 million of those were reserved for the us.  the other 20 million had to be split between the globe.   there was no way canada was going to jump ahead of the line of the us for either moderna or pfizer, and canada doesn't have the power eu does to threaten export controls in order to lesson supply disruptions.

overall, the article does nothing but rehash old talking points that don't hold water when put to actual facts.",liberals

&gt;above all, though, the dissonance between israeli policy and american liberalism’s putative values has grown increasingly conspicuous. netanyahu once made some effort to keep up the pretense that his government was interested in a two-state solution. but the ascent of the israeli far right, the robust support for israel among american evangelicals, and the newfound indifference of gulf state monarchs to palestinian liberation have rendered such pretenses unnecessary...it does not face any concerted global pressure to reconcile its treatment of the palestinians with international norms of human rights; such norms no longer exist, even nominally, when one of the world’s great powers is committing a cultural genocide in broad daylight. there is no external brake on the rightward shift of israeli public opinion.

&gt;liberal american jews — raised on a vision of israel as a beacon of gay rights and tech innovation — are often oblivious to just how reactionary israeli opinion has become. in a 2016 pew poll, a plurality of israeli jews agreed with the statement “arabs should be expelled or transferred from israel.” the state’s policies reflect this sentiment. both within israel proper and the occupied territories, de facto apartheid is giving way to the de jure variety. there is no politically relevant israeli left for u.s. liberals to identify with. there is no proffered narrative for how unconditional american support for israel is supposed to yield two states for two peoples. the story is now, in essence, “read the hamas charter and you’ll see that the palestinians deserve what’s coming to them.”

i think this passage could be applied exactly to canada. many canadians still have an image of israel from a couple decades ago, when a two-state solution had strong support. but israeli politics has changed a lot, as have the facts on the ground. public opinion is catching up to that and this issue is not going to go away.",liberals

&gt;joe rogan and much of his audience

he's admitted he's a moron and that his ideas on politics shouldn't be trusted. 

besides that, we're talking of a different crowd where things are much more polarized and a system in which there are ultimately two choices. if it was a system like canada's progressives would have their own party, and they'd be stuck in the same quagmire that the ndp is stuck today. 

&gt;in any case, the liberals already have the centre on lock. it's hard to see how the ndp could make enough inroads there to justify abandoning their base. electoral politics supposed to be about providing an alternative.

if they don't then they can't win. it's a vicious cycle, appeal to the base because you want what you still have, but you need to appeal to the center to get more. but that article says something else, and that is why jacobin is out of touch to me, they think going more progressive will win them tons of victories. it's just going to cost them more.",liberals

greenhouse gases driving rapid climate change come from many different sources, and most people are responsible for an unsustainable quantity of emissions.

buildings, transportation, industry, electricity generation, and agriculture account for most greenhouse gases. so we have to rapidly and fundamentally transform how all of these sectors run. a bit more complicated than phasing out cfcs! add to that the fact that temperature rise can cause feedback loops that release more emissions, specifically due to permafrost and methane hydrates, and you have a hell of a problem on your hands.

and don't forget the parallel policy resolutions endorsing a massive national nuclear build-out program, and the one banning small modular reactors on the premise that nuclear has been recognized to be unsafe for the environment.

of course, all of this needs to be labelled with the caveat that *all the parties* tend to have some real stinkers at policy resolution time.  alberta's ucp comes to mind in particular, as do the federal liberals in 2015.  wait to pass judgement on the ones that actually pass.",liberals

&gt;independent isps said they would have to increase their internet prices and launched a series of appeals. they now see this election as existential, with the fate of the crtc decision potentially hinging on a cabinet decision by whoever forms the next government.

we should not be placing the value of bloated corporate entities over that of millions of ordinary canadians, and especially not in the name of profit. in 2021, a quick google search tells me that bell canada made $600 million and rogers made $300 million in q1 2021, and they each made about a billion dollars in 2020. and that's *profit*, not revenue. that is gross.

in the age of covid and lockdowns, access to the internet ought to be considered a fundamental right in canada.  yes, it is that important. yes, it is privilege for canadians compared to most of the world. but it is literally the closest thing humanity has ever had to the sum of all human knowledge and experience. let that sentence sink in a little, and step away from 30 years of normalization to consider how incredible that is. in 1990, it was literally something you only saw in star trek, akin to transporters and replicators in terms the scale of its contribution to moving us forward to that human utopia. 

yet here we are in 2021, with a government that not only has lied about providing better and fuller access to the internet, but has done so for seemingly no other reason than to enrich themselves, their friends, and their cronies. this is a battle smaller isps have been fighting for years, effectively fighting against the government to provide cheaper access to canadians. turn that statement around to see how ridiculous it is: the government is fighting to make sure you pay more and more to access the internet. 

imagine if the liberals were truthful in their platform: we promise to increase your monthly fees and make sure that no competitors can offer a better price. we promise to make the poorest canadians sacrifice more to access the network that has all the information and media you will ever need. forward. for everyone (who can pay for it).",liberals

lowering pricing is incredibly easy if you have the political will to do so.  
you mandate the telcos lease space on their networks to resellers at reasonable rates. if you do freedom doesn't have to have inzone and out of zone. freedom can offer home internet in a bundle nationally, so can videotron, so can cogeco. teksavvys of the world can have much lower prices.

this is an issue if we create large financial hurdles to entering politics. it results in a lack of representation across the board, we should have representatives who exist across most sectors of our society instead of business people and professionals. our current very polarizing state is after decades of this type of representation, why can't we seem to get our shit together?

gpcs7ga,2021-03-01T07:16:12.000-08:00,"under trudeau, canada is saudi arabia’s most dedicated gunrunner well this claim is at least *mostly* false, as the us has continued negotiating further arms deals with saudi arabia since the khashoggi incident, and has been instrumental in the yemen war.  canada has not. trudeau is merely carrying the harper-era equipment deal forward. therefore this article and your related sentiments are bunk.

aside from this, i feel that we're both grown up enough to figure that there's a big reason why the west is still very friendly with saudi arabia, even since 9/11.

for starters, the range of weapons-importing nations is narrow.  saudi arabia is the only major player in that regard these days, and will therefore have every arms-producing nation at their doorstep over that.  do i blame the us for being in the mix?  of course not.  do i blame canada either?  not really, no, even with hindsight.  but i'm not immature enough to think otherwise, sorry. 

from an economic standpoint, the us, france, russia, the uk and china are the major weapons-exporting nations dealing with saudi.  canada by scale isn't even on the radar.

from a geopolitical standpoint, western nations justify weapons sales to saudi because it fulfills their objectives.  (suppressing terror, suppressing iran's influence in the gulf region.)  and that's all that canada would need to cite to justify their meager arms deal.  so what?

meanwhile, despite the odd highly-publicized incident, saudi arabia continues to be more westernized by the day.  economically, certainly, but even socially as well.  those stories are often downplayed in favour of rhetoric and bullshit.

but i suppose there are a lot of canadians who believe only rhetoric and bullshit, and the media has to serve that market.

ps. the us is not the shittiest country in the world, by any metric.  if you're canadian, you should've automatically apologized for saying that by now, imho.  :)",liberals

like socialism on paper is a high minded ideal about equality in practice it is brutal authoritarianism to maintain order as party loyalty trumps competence in any position of power. libertarianism on paper is a high minded ideal about personal liberty that in practice is a cover for bigotry, racism, and tribalism under the pretext of individual liberty. there is a reason why centrism is so popular. in the early to mid 20th century we have seen what both far right and far left morph into. and they are both terrifying and oddly similar in the end. there is a reason why when china gave up on communism but not authoritarianism they seem very similar to fascist regimes. 

but how can bernier make the antimask/antivax crowd happy without causing our healthcare system to collapse due to lack of icu capacity? would you be happy if covid had a 5% death rate because we cannot treat the sick? i agree with overturning trudeau's gun law. but i would want it replaced with regulations that are clear so gun makers can design guns for the legal market, not a list of scary guns that are banned to be updated at a whim. but would you want to overturn the earlier handgun and assault rifle bans as well?

no, it is literally fighting against that mind set. it is that they are equivalent (statistically) and as such government should be composed of a (roughly) equivalent ratio as the country.

as a poc i have no problem having a white mp, lawyer, doctor etc. as individuals there is no problem with white men holding any such position. the issue is that when you look at the fact that certain positions are dominated by certain groups in a way that does not reflect demographics. that is indicative of a systemic issue. and there are two issues with that. firstly, lack of diverse representation leads to further lack of diversity. by having role models from their communities in a role, a child is more likely to look to enter that career. secondly, it is the lack of perspective. 

the lack of perspective is the bigger issue i would like to talk about here. i will use an example from health care for this point. there are multiple disease where the symptoms have only ever really been studied on white skin leading to darker skin people not being diagnosed properly. this is an issue that was apparently not on doctors radars for a long time. various poc who are now doctors or med students are doing research on these diseases and publishing books/articles to talk about how symptoms may appear differently in different races. due to this increased representation, the white male doctors are now also more aware of the issue and are now also better prepared to treat poc. so i don't need my personal doctor to be a poc as long as there are adequate poc in the medical system to ensure those perspectives are seen. 

look into the concept of unconscious bias. we all have it and it plays into why we may not think something is a big deal when it doesn't affect us. this goes for political issues. if you only have white men making laws they will be in an echo chamber. even if as individuals they are great and capable people. 

don't take it so personally, it isn't about individuals it's about trends in society.

* anything about breach of contract (i'm assuming that is what is blanked out before the statement of \"each of the foregoing conditions must be proved with clear and convincing evidence\")

i'm saying its hit a wall where the politics has stopped being the absolute primary motivator. if politics writ large was number one he would have waited. there's no question otoole would have been better than trudeau for him. 

i think what i'm trying to say is not that he cares, its that his sobering has come because of internal alberta politics and seeing a the real health crisis wall in front of him. 

do they have your best interest in mind? no, probably not. but have they put aside politics *enough* to actually make the decisions that are actually helpful? i think they've gotten to that point. 

and i think they're playing a very dumb roundabout approach to getting a passport in place. they are describing it differently from others but the actual reality is the same. 

let's be honest. in ontario restaurants for example are required to register to operate under the vaccine program and if they don't register they will need to be closed. the difference between ontario and alberta is just semantics. businesses will need to decide whether they want to participate or not in not having restrictions on themselves, or businesses who want to operate must be registered with the province - its the same.

vaughan is more affluent and italian instead of visible minority, with some jewish community in the southern part. not sure how it will lean.

mississauga has a lot more indian than chinese community, and indians lean liberal a lot more than chinese. this will make it harder to flip, though there are some ridings that will be closer to flip.

companies such as amazon are powerful and will leverage business decisions to delay or remove these tax increases. it would take 10 years of legal battles before these online giants will pay a cent. justin pitched the same bs in the last election. never happened because these 2 want to spend today instead of being fiscally responsible.  i honestly believe they both want to better their country, but economics doesnt work that way.

hcs5cay,2021-09-13T14:10:13.000-07:00,"provincially orange, federally blue. what gives in edmonton? global demand for hydrocarbons continues to trend upwards. pipelines are more about accessing global markets than anything else.

there is a good talk by chantal hebert where she says pipelines aren't necessary because trains work, and you can stop a train if demand for oil globally drops. (something to that effect). what she omitted is the railroad was a resource driven, national infrastructure project to get resources from the interior to the coast. imagine if the same logic had applied then! oh, well we don't know if people will continue to want wheat, and lumber, and ore despite all indications otherwise. its too big a risk to invest in a railroad. after all, if demand dips you can just park your buggy and let your horse run free!

\\&gt;\"my original question stands - is this a short-term play to capitalize while we can or do people see oil and gas a permanent boon to alberta and oil field workers?\"

this is a complicated question. the last time alberta saw an oil boom was in the 1970s. the provincial ab government attempted to establish a sovereign wealth fund to help diversify the economy and reduce dependence on oil long term for when oil prices drop. a certain liberal pm with the last name trudeau established the national energy program (nep), transferring $100 billion dollars in alberta resource revenues to the more riding rich provinces of on, and qc, while setting price limits on canadian domestic oil. very popular in the east because it stabilized the price of oil and subsidized public spending, very unpopular in the west because it made ab even more dependent on oil and reduced revenues. if not for the nep, we likely would not be having this conversation today. 

nobody, especially those in oil and gas, is stupid enough to believe oil is infinite. there is a lot in canada though, and global demand is trending upwards. coal plants overseas can be retrofitted to burn natural gas, which emits %50 as much as coal. when you consider how many coal plants are being built in china and se asia, having an abundant, cheap source of natural gas available in the pacific can reduce global emissions, even though canada's emissions might rise. as the name implies, global warming is a global problem.

the problem with environmentalist opposition to pipelines is that it is a single issue. they don't have to consider global demand, hell, even canadian demand. they don't consider all the products, plastics, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, that require petroleum. they don't have to consider how public services are funded. all they have to do is say no. it is easy to be an environmentalist when you have a white collar job in vancouver and you think food comes from the grocery store and plastic grows on trees.

more broadly, many will oppose oil and natural gas production in canada, but will still expect oil and gas to be cheap and widely available. without a drastic shift in demand globally, demand will just be met by foreign producers, such as the us, saudi arabia, or venezuela.

never mind that oil is a vital resource for any armed force, and having a secure domestic supply of petrol is essential for national defense. but i digress. 

\\&gt;will there ever be a point where production drops off as we shift to renewables and alberta/albertans will be ready for it? and accept it?

which renewables will be put in place in ab? hydro? not enough deep, fast flowing rivers to meet energy demand. wind? possibly, but again, can it consistently meet demand? solar? it is dark and cold in calgary and edmonton for %50 of the year. its a curse of the norther hemisphere. nuclear? definitely possible, but again, you run into the environmentalist problem. it is a stable, safe, low emission power source, but it is also single issue infrastructure development. if people in montreal and toronto are opposed, you can bet on the feds stepping in to stop development. not everywhere in canada is blessed with tributaries to the st. lawrence for abundant free energy.  

the real question is, if ab manages to get a pipeline built, will the federal government allow revenues to stay in ab to make it less dependent on oil going forward as oil reserves deplete? will the feds allow ab to use that income to become more energy independent? personally, i doubt it.",liberals

hcs8704,2021-09-13T14:37:50.000-07:00,"o'toole makes pitch to women voters, vows to hike benefits for grieving parents is the assumption then that parents who do currently stay home with their children would rather be working and would do so if child care was only $10/day? if not, this seems like a waste of government money since those with kids already in childcare are obviously willing to pay the current price. genuinely trying to understand the real benefit here. 

i’m a stay at home mom, so i haven’t ever been too keen on this concept. i can understand the concept that this would *presumably* increase work force and therefore taxes paid, but that assumes that parents currently at home would go to work if childcare was less expensive, which i would doubt (based on no actual research, just merely opinion) is realistic for most situations.

edit: i suppose childcare costs are currently tax deductible. i’m not sure if they still would be in the $10/day system, but even if they were the amount would obviously be significantly less. i guess depending on how this played into tax brackets it could potentially be a pro for the cheap childcare.",conservatives
