the only grounds to dismiss him in my mind are that he didnt tell the reserves about his charge, which could net him a minor form of discipline... probably not enough to warrant him quitting.

this fella is in a similar, if not slightly more serious predicament, as justin trudeau was when he was accused of sexual assault (this mp was actually charged with sexual assault - trudeau was only publicly accused). im not sure if this mp or justin trudeau disclosed their accusations to the party.

speaking for myself, i'm fully aware that we currently hold 338 simultaneous elections.  the important thing to note here, though, is that there is no fundamental reason that we must continue to hold 338 simultaneous elections, where each contest elects exactly one representative.

we could just as well hold 169 elections where each contest elects exactly two representatives.  or 60 elections of 5 representatives each plus 15 of 2 and 8 of 1.  or other combinations.  or, yes, at the other extreme one big election that selects 338 representatives.

because humans are overwhelmingly the cause of cc? this is not a controversial position anymore.
