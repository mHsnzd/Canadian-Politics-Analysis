to suggest that perjury is at all similar to allowing the state to far more broadly adjudicate the truth about the world generally is completely false. if you want to tell the court that you sincerely believe there are microchips in a vaccine, you can do that, it's not perjury. it's not perjury if you should reasonably know that's not true either. if you definitely know it's not true, and that knowledge is related to your testimony, that's probably perjury. 

and again, this is narrowly limited to testimony given under oath. to expand that to general public life and then pretend there is an easily identifiable objective viewpoint on most subjects is crazy and authoritarian.

i'm not thinking of politicians or staffers, but supporters - voters, donors, and volunteers. from horgan's point of view, he's got a coalition which includes both federal ndp voters and a large proportion of federal liberal voters.

&gt; the lpc lets their mps take a stand against the pipeline where it’s unpopular (e.g. the lower mainland) and the ndp lets its mps take a pro-pipeline stance where it’s popular (e.g. alberta). that *is* the compromise position.

i'm not sure that's going to satisfy ndp supporters. horgan was [interviewed shortly after the 2019 election](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-a-pipeline-fight-with-quebec-may-be-looming/), and he said that both he and singh were resigned to tmx going through:

&gt; “[federal ndp leader] jagmeet singh has said the same thing,” mr. horgan said. “he recognizes that the liberals and conservative members of parliament far outnumber those opposed to the pipeline. he talks about the inevitability of it also.”

but because tmx isn't a done deal - again, there's still protesters who are attempting to obstruct construction - i think singh is going to face pressure from ndp supporters in bc to take a more active role. certainly i can't see avi lewis and naomi klein taking the same attitude as horgan and singh and accepting tmx as inevitable, the price to pay for national unity and alberta's u-turn on climate policy under notley.",liberals

it depends on how you see it. intellectually ? it's been dead since the 2000s. i mean, the rest of the country has been very clear, there is no reform offer on the table it's the status quo take it or leave it (and frankly, after bourassa's shitty bluff i can't blame the rest of the country for having this response, i mean at some point it's put up or shut up). however, the same can be said for independantism, not much has moved on that front in the last 15 years and nothing seem to make tick the needle for independance support, the fracture lines are mostly frozen in place with about 30-50% of **french** quebecers supporting independance depending on how you ask the question.

that being said, it seems to me quebec nationalists have better adapted to this situation than the federalists by deciding to test the limits of the status quo instead of trying directly for independance. who knows where it will lead us.

as for the liberals, the brand name is burned for at least 10 years, easy. they should declare political bankrupcy and start over with a new name. the only thing they have going for them is the insane immigration level which gives them about 2-3 additional safe ridings per election cycle. couillard tenure completely killed this party, he made the mistake of going mask off with his radical support of multiculturalism. combine this with their healthcare reform clusterfuck... legault must be thanking jesus/satan or whatever every night for having dodged that bullet, since barette was initially in his team before ditching the caq for the liberals.

&gt;the rise of nationalism doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see \"winning conditions\" shape up for a grand 3rd push tomorrow, but we may see canada die of a thousand cuts instead.

frankly, there is only one winning condition for independence : equalization. it has been the best federalist argument for a long time. the day we stop collecting is the day independence support goes above 50%. but that's unlikely to happen for structural reasons : no oil no money. the very small oil/gas ressources in quebec are unfortunately exactly where people don't want to exploit them, the anticosti island (which is a nature reserve) and in the middle of the southern quebec farmlands. farmlands are rare here, only 1.5% of our territory is arable lands so obviously people need to eat and don't want to sacrifice food security for oil and gas money (i.e. it's not just the tree huggers who oppose it).",liberals

as for the disparate impact, it’s because quebec already took care of its religious people in institutions in the 60s. nobody gave nuns a choice either, yet they were a huge part of the school and healthcare systems. they were told to defrock or leave.

there are two secondary schools near me that used to be run by the brothers, there hasn’t been a new brother in 50 years. my public college used to be a seminary, it was expropriated.

i think the attitude you're notionally referring to is generally more directed towards the federal ndp, who are a separate body from the provincial ndp, for a start.

as for the history of the situation in bc, a recent summary can be found here:
https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-b-c-liberals-try-to-divert-eyes-from-their-disastrous-housing-record

basically the key factors to understand are that gordon cambell was always a real estate man first, and throughout the 90's (as mayor of vancouver) and early 2000's his stance was extremely pro-foreign investment. during his fifteen-year tenure (i'm including christy clark's time as well since by all appearances she was only ever a sock puppet) prices in bc went up something like 130%, compared to about a 30% increase in the prior 25 years. they finally introduced a foreign buyers tax in 2016 when they saw the tide of opinion changing; quoting the article:

- \"...for the most part, at least until 2016, the b.c. liberals were behaving as if they just wanted housing prices to rise. they acted as if they didn’t want to do anything but grow people’s housing equity.”

the bc ndp subsequently introduced an additional speculation and vacancy tax which combined seemed to coincide with a flattening of prices in 2017 and 2018. and then covid happened.

nazi's found in the 2010's were deported back to germany and charged with crimes relating to the holocaust. 

you are right, i made a mistake with the nuremburg trials reference, with the focus on architects and leaders. but lower level people are still held accountable as of the past several years. 

if we have a sixties scoop and the final residential school closing in 1996, it would make sense that a very large amount of people involved are active in canada. if canada has recognized this as a genocide, holding the perpetrators of genocide accountable would be the bare minimum. 

as far as architects and leaders, i'm sure there are many out there too. i have little faith trudeau will investigate his own father, who prior to being prime minister was, i believe, was minister of justice in the 60's, so would have been well aware of activities happening across the country. furthermore, trudeau and chretien published the 1969 white paper, which was heavily criticized at the time. chretian is still alive and was minister of indian affairs in the 60's, should he be held accountable in any form?

i don't understand how we are supposed to fix relations if we are both inadequately addressing current problems and are unwilling to take responsibility and accountability for the actions, which our current government has acknowledged is genocide. i suppose our track record of importing nazi's post ww2, through things like the ratline is a better indicator of the country we are.

the same people convinced he and sophie are separated because she caught him in bed with seamus o'regan or ben mulroney (!) will tweet out 30 seconds later that it was actually melanie joly. not to mention how the \"gay = pedo\" derangement is strong with the mouthbreathers too. that asinine conspiracy theory about his teaching career being floated during the campaign never could come to a consensus of whether it was a live boy or a dead (pregnant) girl he supposedly \"made to sign an nda.\"

and when all else fails, they revert to \"he wears rainbow socks.\"",liberals

my problem is that singh knows on a personal level what the impact of this bill is - ie, he could not become a schoolteacher in quebec.  

(it's also telling that nobody is talking about jewish judges or sikh cops - it's all about muslim women teaching children.  the hijab is a symbol of female oppression, we're told, even though i know numerous kick-ass muslim women who wear a head scarf and love canada and quebec.  but we have to protect women from their own evil choices, right?  sounds familiar.)

the problem is, there will be no impact from the ndp's stance.  they're is now an anglophone party with no representation in quebec beyond boulerice.  if they'd done it during the election, when something was actually at stake and they still harboured ambitions of winning seats, it might have had an impact.

this is the problem federalist parties have on this issue (including the liberal party of quebec).  they talk out of both sides of their mouths.  they are obviously against bill 21.  own that view.  they are basically lying to the population of both english and french canada by pretending it's a provincial issue.  it's obviously not a provincial issue.  it goes to the heart of the confederation.

i'll go a bit further on trudeau.

what was really needed from the beginning was a strong stance from the liberal party of canada.  they needed to throw short-term political considerations aside and take this on directly.  the liberals have a lot of representation in quebec - they can and should claim to represent the views of the plurality of the province, at least federally.  they are the only political force capable of fighting this on any level - they need to do the work not just to fight the bill on a legal level, but to convince people it's a bad bill.

the variants could also easily come from the people that go over to the us all the time for essential work. i wouldn't be surprised if we had the variants long before we even knew they existed. everyone was just woefully underprepared for the pandemic.

in my opinion (from ontario), is that if provinces had done a real stringent lockdown to the point where we could contact trace, things would have been much, much better. but we kept opening up way too soon and things kept getting out of hand. afaik contact tracing has been impossible in ontario since january.

there's also the point that canada's structure isn't made for efficiency. the provinces all took their own crack at the problem with varying results. a national lockdown all at the same time would have been the most effective measure (including locking down international travel), but that's functionally impossible to implement in our country.",liberals

it may be true of the ab ndp, but that's why i feel they align more ideologically with the lpc, because federally, i don't see it. the federal ndp appears in all ways to be dominated by the woke variety of the same urban socialites associated with the liberals, plus a small army of undergrad activists. just look at some of the resolutions that made it through to a vote at their last policy convention.

&gt; albertan's tend to be more libertarian minded where as the liberals are a very statist party.

the idea that the lpc are a more statist party than one literally founded by socialists, and whose economic policy leans towards nationalization (if not necessarily going that far), is mind-boggling to me. the ndp today are the polar opposite of libertarian. 

if anything it seems like more of a pragmatic decision to support the party promising to subsidize you most. if you're a socially conservative person but who cares deeply about agricultural subsidies, it makes sense that you'd swing between the cpc and ndp. but that's also why the western provincial ndp parties tend to shy away from identity politics.",liberals

the lpc being our middle line party is at the mercy of canada's political center. with that, this government has taken light/downplayed actions on all of the social issues that have come to light since 2019, at least compared to the stances of the ndp. the more divided politics become, and the less the public approves of the lpc, the better for the ndp. both the ndp and the cpc play heavily on attacking trudeau's character to gain support from trudeau skeptics from both side of the aisle. tudeau's potential failings will see gains for both opposition parties.

jagmeet as a leader had trouble and will continue to have troubles in many canadian demographics. giving quebec the benefit of the doubt on whether there is prejudice on voting for a sikh man, jagmeet is a western canadian anglophone who hasn't expressed much support for quebec's autonomous ambitions. jagmeet is ambitiously progressive, expressing ideas that aren't in the general canadian political discourse, excluding himself from skeptics and the more socially conservative. one of the assets the ndp has is being a new party that hasn't been in power is they don't have any blood on their hands from the raising social tensions.

h2da98c,2021-06-19T08:26:40.000-07:00,"young adult looking to learn more about conservatives to be honest, i dont think your views are really that far fetched from what the current overton window would consider \"conservative\" ideology. i say that as somewhat of a classic liberal myself. 

despite what multiple echo chambers will say, conservatives arent hateful, scared, old relics of a time that has past looking to maintain something of a status quo. as with the left and their fringes, the right has its same problems. the thing is in this day and age, social media has allowed multiple outlets to amplify their message and personally i find many of the politicians simply choose a side to hide behind and use the proponents of a cause as cannon fodder to shield themselves, or to push through legislation that only benefits a select few, with those few barely rarely if ever being the working class or common folk. 

since you put up your beliefs, i'll post mine-as someone who again, has voted for the big blue tent more times than not.

* when it comes to lgbt issues, i believe in live and let live. or to put it more subtly \"what they eat doesn't make us ****\" we all get bent over the same barrel at tax time. what consenting and informed adults do in their own time, is their business. keyword however being adults. i do believe conversion therapy shouldnt be allowed.
* cancel culture imho is nothing more than people that believe the system around them needs to be destroyed and rebuilt to suit their personal needs. i can agree with the basic humanity side of their arguments, but the way they are going about it is only going to cause some kind of civil conflict i fear. 
* i can agree on your statement of victim mentality in some cases. i do believe there are people that have been discriminated against (for instance about 30 years ago i knew of active movements in my own local to keep people of certain descent out-way before my time), but today that has just become \"if i didnt get what i want its because im x!\" 
* i believe in personal accountability and responsibility. you want something-you earn it. the other side seems to forget that there are people in occupations that work extraordinary hours, or in dangerous conditions, or have invested a solid decade of their life into training and hold immense liability. that gas fitter that fixed your furnace can go to jail if that appliance messes up. that doctor-sued. people working 14 hour, 16 hour, if not more, days. and the one thing they all have in common is they all basically pay enough in taxes at the end of the year you could buy a car or a boat with what they pay individually between income, sales, and carbon taxes, in cash. its ironic that 9/10 times the people that push for an expanded welfare state or ubi often are those that are either in flooded industries, or failed to launch per say. of course i could argue that in some of these cases these people had the odds stacked against them thanks to how we flood our labour market or put in miles of red tape against businesses. however if you want to tax people regardless of earnings over a certain amount (that one could almost guarantee would barely be liveable), you will see a complete breakdown of this country.
* police brutality should not happen. we should have better support for officers as these are people that see humanity at its lowest, daily. that can and will definitely mess someone up. im not totally opposed to having social workers handling distress calls, as having the police called for you in your lowest moment can trigger anxiety, but i think that will end the day a social worker is attacked or killed.
* gun legislation to me-as someone who is not a pal holder or a firearms owner, is more of an assault on property rights and freedoms than it is about safety. a disarmed populace is one that is forced into silence. not the future i want to see.   
* i believe in a greener approach to energy. i also know that will not happen overnight. i also dont believe the world will implode in 20 years if we dont abandon life as we know it tomorrow. theres a huge ball of energy in space so big that our planet has decided to go in circles around it. if we can use it to our advantage-why the hell not? 
* we have a legal system, but not a justice system. i dont believe in drugs being punished as hard as they are. but i also dont believe the punishments for legit crime here in canada fit the crimes.

i know some people are probably reading this and are getting ready to call me some kind of plinko. but from what i see: the left today pushes for changes which while some could benefit society, are filled with multiple bad actors in the way of politicians. these \"progressive\" leaders are more often than not authoritarian leaning. nothing comes for free. the more control you give a government, in the dullest of terms, the more power it has over you. considering the cons and the ppc are the only parties that seem to still offer some sort of rejection of the current trends, here i am.

you mostly sound like a classical liberal and i'd argue the cpc is currently the most reasonable home for them. i was a green member and ran for them federally in 2015 but they seem pretty caught up in the identitarian stuff and have started tearing themselves up over how the party should posture on issues they cannot reasonably influence.

as a rule, the ideology dominating culturally becomes more and more insane/unpleasant as people jump on the bandwagon, momentum builds, and no force exists that is able to check its excesses. eventually it starts being abandoned by counterculture young people and people willing to put up with a bit of social stigma. after that, the dam breaks and the pendulum starts swinging back.

this happened to right-wing religious ideology in the us (though would have been a bit before your time) and is starting to happen with left wokism. simply put, the conservatives will likely be the more reasonable place to be for a while because the weaker position of their worldview means they can't afford to be sloppy or crazy.",conservatives

with respect to the snc scandal, the pm literally said he was not inserting politics into an attempt to order the ag to order the dpp to insist on a dpa for snc lavalin. of course he was then found guilty of contravening section 9 of the conflict of interest act by doing *exactly that*; improperly pressuring attorney general wilson-raybould. there is no doubt it was scandal. the man literally attempted to interfere in the proper course of justice, and has not yet been investigated criminally investigated because he sealed all the actions and discussions about what occurred by claiming they are all \"cabinet confidences\" limiting the actions the rcmp can take to not a damn thing.

as for the we scandal, it was an attempt to give over a half a billion dollar contract to assist canadian youth to the company (not the charity) of we holdings, without an open competition, and (importantly) *without using the department of youth* (for which trudeau was certainly aware of its existence, having personally created and served as its first ever minster). he was giving between 500 million and billion dollars to a company, merely associated with a charity, that paid his mother, brother and wife a little over $600,000 combined, and as reported, had effectively bribed the former finance minister (who was relieved of his position as a result). as reported, the contract was \"granted\" the day the we charity advertising pamphlets depicting his mother and wife were sent to his office. then when being investigated, the man who literally marched in parade denouncing harper's use of prorogation to shut down an investigation into a scandal, himself prorogued parliament to shut down the investigation into this scandal.

but yes, clearly none of these things are scandals. totally nothing-burgers. totally not the case that the lpc tries to shut down investigations into grossly inappropriate behavior by its members, using literally anything from prorogation, to falsely claiming cabinet confidence, through to claiming it is slander to question the actions of a minster. and there is certainly *nothing* hypocritical in their actions while doing so.

returning to the original point though, if any member of the military at any rank outside the direct control of the minster acted in this manner, they'd be charged, court martialed, and dishonorably dismissed from her majesty's service, before spending time in prison.

what is obvious is that it must nice to have the minister as a buddy though. not only do you get to keep your job for 4 years after he finds out you've basically been sexually assaulting the same woman for over a decade while abusing your rank and authority, you know he'll have your back and refuse to take any responsibility for you remaining in position, even when senior members of dnd testify that he knew and did nothing. you further be able to rest well at night, assured that he'll be able to continue to provide that top cover for your actions because his boss, the pm himself, will claim it is slander to call for the minister's resignation.",liberals

the cbc made a dramatic pivot over the last 6-10 years.  completely eliminated the old-time \"canadian\" identity stuff like vinyl cafe, sports (especially hockey and curling) coverage, etc and now over 30% of airtime is dedicated to indigenous issues, most shows have repeat topics of racial issues and other social justice issues.  

i did a brief survey of topics covered over a couple of days and close to 90% of the content (on a generalized hourly basis) would be considered \"social justice\" in it's topic.  even when discussing covid, the bulk of the discussion is about how it affects minority populations in canada.  even when discussing economic policies, the bulk of the discussion is about how it affects minority populations.

i don't think he has. i think a lot of the last election was a protest vote and they didn't actually support him much. as i've mentioned it appears that about 25 percent of his vote was pissed off green voters which came as a serious shock to me (geez annimae!) 

and \"done nothing\" would be accurate. he was all but invisible between elections, he was barely visible during the election, there's been no policy conventions, no leadership reviews, no nothing. and he didn't win a seat. even the reform party won seats on their first outing and then had a major breakthrough in their second election. 

he has many reasons to abandon his post from a politial and party point of view. but he has reasons to stay - namely a paycheque and a vanity play. 

as for trudeau, he did weaker than he did in the last election, where he did weaker than he did in the first election. he was supposed to deliver a majority - this was a complete fail for him in his party's eyes. and they can see the writing on the wall, he's almost certainly gone next election. the economic situation is going to get worse, people are already fed up with him and that's not going to get better, they know they're losing power. that is unacceptable to liberals. they will be thinking that a new leader might give them a shot at winning the next one, trudeau is a stick of gum that's been chewed too long. 

he called an election that we didn't need at all in the hopes of more personal power, his leadership has been horrible, the party is sinking in popularity, the economy is taking a nose-dive, and from a party point of view they're going to spend the next 3-4 years with limited power and having to completely wear the financial disaster that's about to hit as trudeau's policy hits home.

however, i can understand that when a public information service spends 80% of it's resources on 5-15% of the population, presumably you can see how some people find that unfair or in excess, regardless of \"historical marginalization\".  a mixed service that still had \"canadiana\" in addition to a social justice effort in a more mixed profile would be more broadly accepted by the moderate conservatives i know.

when was the last time the cbc ran a docu-series on youth hockey, for example, without it being primarily about minority access to hockey or discrimination in hockey, etc?   it seems seldom. that's weird, since 40% of canadian youth play it and most of them have experiences, concerns, joys, memories, formative experiences and even trauma from a variety of aspects of it.   so why exclude their experiences from the canadian discussion?  there are serious issues there beyond those specific issues of discrimination.  why only focus only on the identity issues?

also, that issue becomes especially apparent in this discussion about making it global.  pushing cbc radio one to a global audience would likely be confusing, given how much time is spent on profiles of indigenous musicians, etc.  lots of \"personal interest\" stuff, and a lot less on global issues, etc.  obviously, the bbc operates its \"world service\" slightly differently than domestic channels, but regarding the cbc, this dichotomy would be especially apparent.",conservatives

secondly, no, the only benefit is not just that some old people that would otherwise lie elsewhere get a bit more comfortable life.

the benefit is that families get to be reunited.   contributing immigrants don't have to make the heart staking decisions on whether or not to stay in canada, or go back to help take care of their parents.   canada now becomes more attractive to skilled immigrants sought after by many countries who also have strong family ties and would like to be able to move their parents to their new country in the near future.",liberals

thus, we need to be a lot more skeptical about drawing firm predictions from pre-election polling than they do (and people who's perception comes from watching americans).",conservatives

this is a totally self serving, partisan double standard. they're cabinet ministers. neither can interfere politically in an intenral investigation in their department. that would be completely inapropriate. they have to let due process run its course. walbourne knew that. he should have gone to the proper investigative body. disclosing the details to a cabinet minister would have completely prjudice the case, and would have resulted in any prosecution being thrown out of court. that's why i believe he was trying to scuttle the case as part of the old boys network. 

\\&gt; sajjan didn't push it to an independent investigative body ... 

it's not up to him to do that. it's up to the ombudsman to approach the proper investigative agency, which is exactly what sajjan told him to do. it's not a political matter for a politican to deal with; it is a legal matter for the courts. the ombusdman was deliberately politicizing the case. 

\\&gt; as a vet myself, i understand duty and what it takes to make hard decisions ...

like not banging your secretary and dating people under your command. you know too that you are bound by law. you cannot do anything illegal; like interfere politically in a court case.",liberals

gwzp2kf,2021-05-04T14:37:15.000-07:00,"conservatives vote against bill on net-zero emissions as it clears legislative hurdle the carbon tax is actually one of the only things the current govt can be proud of having done. the idea is a simple one, but fundamental one - to change any economy you need pressure - this is a pressure. you need to sway people and buisnsses away from using a product criticial to their everyday lives. do not assume that this, like any one thing, will 'fix' climate change. climate change will need 100s of moves like this, that eventually lead to such change. the idea is the money from this goes to invest in current 'greener' industries and the rnd new technologies to create new industries. without it, and assuming all other freedom remain intact, why should canadians change their use of fossil fuels? they won't otherwise. we live in a capitalist economy that will and can thrive with abusing the earth a few more decades.

this is just a step, an important one, but just a step in forming a new foundation of industries to replace fossil fuels. this is an incredibly complex problem, i do not understand why people are so fixated on this 'one cure fits all' idea. it won't. that was never the intent of any of these ideas. this is the greatest problem humans have ever faced, more complex then even covid.  i do not understand how the general public believes we can possibly deal with this without taking measures that make the short term somewhat uncomfortable in some respects, but clearly not all.  it is naïve and ignorant of the gross complexities of this. regardless, the carbon tax isn't just something the current govt made up - it has been studied and supported by the un. and lastly, apart from some new unknown technology undoing the current damage, or mitigating the rate - we will have to do stuff like this. and even in the us will see measures like this unfold under various names. so, i think support and encouragement of the adaption of taxes and policies with similar themes is the route all nations will have to follow due to the ever rapidly increasing rate of global warming's impacts around the world.",conservatives
gwzpgw4,2021-05-04T14:41:33.000-07:00,"the 2022 ontario election is just one year away - what will be the outcome? it is probably to way too early to tell, but i speculate a minority government and one most likely formed by either the ndp (more likely) or maybe the olp (less likely given the sheer hatred for wynne).

doug ford fumbled the pandemic response and alienated a large portion of his base with the constant lockdowns and the implementation of police powers that was later rescinded. on top of that, many businesses were forced to shutdown (permanently), people's savings were burned through, and the cfib basically scolded him for his policies. he basically turned into a liberal. none of this goes over well with freedom-loving/business-owning conservatives. on top of that, the rest of ontarian voters are so paranoid about the pandemic that they've criticized him for not doing/locking down enough (which i find ridiculous).

i know voters tend to have the memory of a goldfish, but i don't know if that would be the case with this past year. i know i personally can't in good conscience support the opc anymore, so i feel politically homeless and i know plenty of conservatives who would agree. i guess we'll see next year though.

i would also say that it may depend on who is running the federal government as well. ontario tends to vote opposing parties between two levels of government if you look at historical trends.",conservatives
