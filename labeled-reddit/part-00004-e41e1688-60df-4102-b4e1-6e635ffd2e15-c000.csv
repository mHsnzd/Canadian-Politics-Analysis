if it’s not about winning, than she has no business being green party leader. a party leader is more effective in parliament than outside. jagmeet singh and elizabeth may had to move across the country to get elected in a riding. if jagmeet continued to run in his provincial riding in brampton he wouldn’t be in parliament right now.

gjxuwbm,2021-01-19T21:04:27.000-08:00,"affordable housing for all canadians by 2030 - will cmhc's plan work? it's very annoying to see you attribute a problem to the federal government that has been caused by provincial governments and municipalities. 

here's the truth about the housing crisis - it is caused by a lack of supply of housing. yes, the investor class and property speculators make it worse, but they only exist because a lack of housing is forcing up the price. 

canadian municipalities and provincial governments all essentially implement the same standards in planning and zoning policies 30 years ago - those policies put an emphasis on maintaining historic streets, the 'look and feel' of neighbourhoods, and appeasing community planning councils (aka nimbys.) 

these policies are now bearing fruit, and that fruit is pretty towns and cities that don't actually have enough housing. the development and construction of housing has been suppressed by these nimby idiots who can't see past their toes. 

the true solution is increasing housing supply, by intensifying urban areas - all urban areas! i'm not talking about downtown toronto, i'm talking about adding density in the existing surburbs or mid-town neighbourhoods in major cities that still, inexplicably, have single detached houses with large backyards. we need more neighborhoods comprised of mid-rise, high density housing blocks. 

have you ever been to europe? did you notice how single detached housing was very rare within a city? most people live in large flats, with balconies and terraces for outdoor space. this is because detached houses are an incredibly wasteful form of housing! 

most municipalities have drawn up new city plans, after the federal government put a huge amount of pressure on the provinces when the trudeau government was elected. correcting the issue of housing supply is going to take time, this isn't going to change over night because it takes 2+ years just to get all the approvals to construct large housing developments.

if you’re making an assumption about someone you don’t know anything about, well that speaks to your biases. if trudeau picked some old white dude,  would it even cross your mind to be “cautious” as you put it? there in lies the problem that i’ve been highlighting in this thread, people screeching identity politics as if it a) only applies to minorities for some reason and b) if that is the first and foremost concern, when the grand chief is advocating for an indigenous person to fill the roll (when there’s never been one), they’re telling on themselves. don’t try and shield this in some sort of moral concern, that’s just disingenuous.",liberals

i agree that the timing of wynne's labour law is suspect, especially given that not long before she insisted a large bump to minimum wage wasn't needed, that her inflation-based increase policy was enough. the point remains: she did it and the world kept turning. i can even still buy ground beef on sale for less than $3/lb. the new rules around scheduling (since removed by premier ford) helped the quality of life for a lot of low income earners, including a lot of people i know.

her unpopularity allowed another government to come in and take a wrecking ball to so much of what wynne (and even mcguinty) accomplished. gone is our market-based solution to climate pricing, gone is mandatory on call pay, gone are any mandatory paid sick days, and minimum wage was frozen for long enough to have nearly erased the effect of wynne's wage bump on workers' paycheques. 

i don't pretend wynne was the political messiah, i'm a critic of any government because no government will be 100% aligned with my wishes for our province, but she also wasn't a political antichrist.",liberals

gjs06n7,2021-01-18T08:40:36.000-08:00,"conservative party confirms that mp derek sloan accepted a donation from a neo-nazi my experience has been that parties generally do not keep mass blacklists for donors as far as i am aware. taking any donation from any sort of organization is usually illegal in canada (given it's usually an incorporated organization and/or a union, the one exception i am aware of is school trustee's running in ontario) so they do have to have some screening mechanisms in place to avoid that. but parties usually have some sort of information on individual voters they keep as a party and it is usually via that list that certain individuals get flagged as a non-supporter and or no contact/refuse donation status but i only saw that particular status on one occasion (probably 10 years ago, apparent quite the nasty individual if i remember correctly).

&amp;#x200b;

yes, parties can refuse a donation and it is very common. in the case of over-donations, they legally have to.  parties have to keep good records of individual donors and it is very common to have a person over donating (going over their legal limit) especially during the month of december (people trying to take advantage of the tax credits but may have forgotten about donations made at other points during the year) so the party is forced to return the excess or entire amount (depends on circumstance).",conservatives

gjsy980,2021-01-18T14:03:35.000-08:00,"canadian conservatives reckon with fallout from capitol hill riot conservatism is a real ideology - full of ideas from great thinkers from aristotle to edmund burke to friedrich hayek (he considered himself a classical liberal, but his ideas inform conservatism today). a core element of conservative thought is the idea that society is organic. you can't simply socially engineer a society to look the way you want - there is wisdom in practices that have evolved over the centuries. change should be gradual - don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. there are times when this kind of thinking is better and worse, but it absolutely has a place in our oft-shaky federation. 

the problem is that the modern right frankly doesn't sound very conservative. indeed, harper, scheer, and o'toole all relied on a style of wedge politics and dog-whistling designed to feed rage, while bringing in extremist elements. conservative partisans are fed a steady diet of threats, which escalate in order to keep the donations flowing. i don't think i've ever met a *happy* conservative.

what if conservatives, i dunno, developed a real agenda for the problems that actual canadians face (instead of the problems that some canadians follow on right wing american media). by that i mean things like:

\\-how can we transition to cleaner energy without devastating the oil patch? 

\\-how can we address a deficit that is 17.5% of gdp (bigger than any g7 country) without imperiling the recovery, or our campaign against the pandemic?

\\-how can canada defend its sovereignty in a world of rising authoritarian states, and declining american power and reliability? 

i realize that these questions are less exciting, difficult to explain, and that they involve difficult tradeoffs. but it's possible to hold elections that turn on these kinds of questions. in 1988 our leaders debated free trade. preston manning, for all of his flaws, fought for the right on the basis ideas. harper did too at first, with a very disciplined campaign built around five core promises (a gst cut, $1200 for childcare, an anti-corruption law, tougher sentences for gun crime, and lower waiting times in hospitals).",conservatives

i'm not saying that prisoners should get the vaccine before vulnerable canadians, but we have \\*made\\* prisoners into vulnerable canadians by our inhumane approach to incarceration and the abuse and lack of health standards we allow to fester in these institutions — because of our negligence and our ability to close our eyes to the cruelty, or worse encourage the cruelty and inhumanity and use them as a prop for political advantage, because, well, \"they're prisoners\".

because they are prisoners the government like it or not is also fully responsible for their safety and they also have very little ability to isolate and protect themselves. i can stay inside and protect myself, but prisoners have limited ability to stay away from others at all and aren't even provided with proper sanitation. this is a compounding factor that makes them even more vulnerable.

and this should not be seen as something that just comes with the territory of being incarcerated. it is, and it is to our collective shame, but it should not be. their punishment is losing right to freedom of person, not to be recklessly discarded and endangered by disease or abuse because 'who gives a shit, they're prisoners, they deserve it'.

there are choices to be made on when prisoners should receive the vaccine and how to prioritize them alongside other vulnerable canadians, but o'toole grandstanding like this and actively dehumanizing them and inventing this as a wedge issue to appeal to people who feed off cruelty for his political gain is not the proper way to do that. o'toole's approach is hateful and disgusting.

on a personal note i would suggest that when you find yourself in life defending or advocating for squalor and neglect in prisons, you should perhaps reflect.",conservatives

i like to think she was a \"milque toast\" premier. she did very little for the province overall, just mostly kept the status quo. only when she realized that ontarians were getting tired of the blandness and looking for changes did she make an effort to add some flavour. however, the new flavour was too late, and many ontarians never got to experience that new taste, so the fear of losing something most never really had or experienced was lost on them.

politicians need to feed the electorate a big bone in the beginning of their term so that it makes it political suicide to remove it. legal weed or obama care in the us are a good example. 

to comment on your eventually selling hydro one argument, while possibly true, it doesn't absolve her in anyway. i know this is hyperbole, but its the same as \"grandma was going to die anyway so it's not really murder's fault she died.\" we as a society blame the person who pulled the trigger.

the harris government broke up ontario hydro into 4 parts: hydro one, ontario power generation, electrical safety authority, and the independent electricity system operator.  ho and opg were restructured and designed to be privatized. both were set up so they weren't a crown corporation like the lcbo, but rather a true corporation with a shareholder. each had one share, and the minister of energy was the share holder. opg is still like that, but ho just split up the share and listed on the tsx.

fossil fuels have many advantages over other energy sources, but they also come with an enormous downside - their ghg emissions.

to a large extent energy consumers aren't really going to care about the details of how energy becomes useful to them.  if hydrogen becomes more prevalent than fossil fuels, they won't care.  if gasoline starts to be manufactured rather than extracted, they won't care.  if large scale electricity storage becomes a thing, they won't care.  if demand side management becomes a thing to smooth out demand, they won't care.

there are lots of opportunities there, opportunities for canadian businesses that are already involved in the business of obtaining, storing, moving and supplying energy to end users, businesses that have the right kinds of employees and knowledge and experience.

even if we are still convinced that climate change is exaggerated or outright false, it seems that to a large extent the rest of the world intends (has begun) to move on.  canada can maintain that that is a mistake, or we can at least start to hedge our bets, and we can try to meet the new demands of energy consumers.",liberals

it will be tremendously harmful if trudeau picks an indigenous person on the basis of identity politics whereby they are not qualified or engage in a similar scandal as payette. can you imagine how harmful that would be to the nation to nation relationship if the first indigenous gg left in disgrace because trudeau once again failed to vet? that's why it must be based on merit. if someone like murray sinclair would be selected i think that would be a wonderful pick.

ford has started testing upon arrival, this is a thing. it took trudeau months, it took a ford press conference and the entire country to agree in order for him to do something about this major problem.

&gt; are the feds fucking up on vaccines? quite possibly. would alberta, ontario and quebec be so heavily reliant on vaccines to combat the pandemic if their own efforts (with money provided by the feds, btw) weren't so half-assed in the months leading up to now? nope. during the lull of the summer before wave 2 hit, what investments did ab and on make to increase icu capacity? contact tracing? testing capacity? very little. are any of those things federal responsibilities? no. and yet let's blame trudeau when he slow providing them with a silver bullet for problems they themselves created.

 of course ford fucked up, what do you suppose we do? lockdown even further? imo we should not have moved from phase 2 as quickly as we did. icu capacity even as of right now is only at 400 people in ontario, peak covid in march we were at 1000. they have now dedicated an entire hospital in vaughn for covid patients, our healthcare has been in shambles for years even before ford got in so lets also be understanding in that scenario. the testing capacity was increased, 75k tests per day in september. also, ontario was one of the lower provinces with cases per 100k, with 14 million people in the province.

&gt;how about the provinces who aren't screaming about a lack of vaccines? what are their situations like? did they invest in icus? testing? tracing? did they institute policies that were proactive in preventing covid from getting into their communities, unlike on, ab and qc?

i think on, ab, and qc are the highest populated provinces in the country, aside from bc. i imagine this is due to sheer population mass. the provinces are screaming as the lpc boasted about the millions of secured vaccines we are now in a predicament of not having the second doses. 

&gt;it's quite easy to blame the provinces who are fucking up - they're the ones responsible for the mess that they are in right now; anyone who says it's the feds' fault that ontario is at 3,000 new cases a day is an idiot. if ford was proactive and provided any leadership whatsoever in the summer and early fall, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in, and he wouldn't be so desperate for vaccines.

we should have locked down ltc homes and made sure there were no in and outs. if you want to see your family that badly, take them in your own care, or take a test. 80% of deaths are over 80 years old, with the amount of cases ontario is putting out consistently we should be in a lot worse scenario than what we are in. we are in the situation we are in because of a lack of vaccine rollout imo. why are doctors that do not go anywhere near a covid patient receiving a vaccine? why the hell have we not vaccinated all ltc homes, started vaccinating the people that are at risk of death or will need to be in the icu if anything were to happen. why are 30 year old healthy doctors getting a vaccine before an 80 year old, or even a 50 year old ltc nurse.",liberals

and the coalition decides who's going to be pm; it's not always the leader of the largest party. i would gather most people who vote liberal want justin trudeau to remain prime minister. heck, even a lot of people who vote ndp, green or the bloc want trudeau to remain prime minister. that's how merkel remains chancellor... and netanyahu continues leading israel in spite of all his corruption. but the \"coalition\" if such a thing existed in canada, could decide to throw trudeau out for whatever reason during negotiations, and force in singh or some random backbencher or independent or even someone with no seat. i guarantee you that if a \"coalition\" decided to stab trudeau and appoint jwr as pm you'd see a red wave of anger in the streets.",liberals

both reports had their own lengthy consultation processes which were open to the public, and both were preceded by [yet another consultation in 2016](https://www.canadiancontentconsultations.ca/home). i decided not to get into that in my initial comment because i knew if i said, “but the liberals have effectively consulted three times on this issue,” i’d hear back, “yeah, but that was not on the actual text of the bill,” as if the two were totally disconnected from each other, and as if michael geist wasn’t writing this post on “lack of consultation” with reference to a parliamentary committee process in which he was literally consulted. as with many of geist’s arguments, it relies heavily on cherry picking, but some people will still insist that all that matters is the cherries that were picked, and not those that are still on the tree.",liberals

gmu1gts,2021-02-10T00:54:07.000-08:00,"let's talk immigration. inequality doesn't bother me. people aren't equal; never have been, never will be.

what's important is that inequality can't get *too* extreme, and even more important, those further up the hierarchy *must* have responsibilities and obligations that scale with their position in the pecking order. that is the only way to maintain a stable, ordered, and virtuous society.

i hope it goes without saying that we do not have that today. inequality isn't outrageous except perhaps in the case of people living on some reserves.

but do any of our elites—whether they call themselves conservative or progressive—have any real obligations or responsibilities to their fellow citizens? hardly. income tax is the long and short of it.

resentment and distrust are inevitable. people feel like chumps for living a decent, hardworking life and stowing away their savings. the rich and powerful care not for this country, and the opinion-setting class actively hate this country and its history, and seek to reward people based on grievance rather than work ethic.

importing foreign people is also not a recipe for a trusting, well-ordered society. people already here and already resentful are going to grow ever more so as liberals import more or more people, especially more unskilled people, and then call us racist for not appreciating being surrounded by people of different languages and cultures in our own homes.

a bunch of commenters here are blathering on about gdp and demographics. we've heard it all before. you're not wrong that the native population is aging, that more people equals more gdp, immigrants are often skilled and entrepreneurial, etc. 

and i'll be the first to admit that canada has traditionally had one of the best and most sane immigration policies in the western world. we're certainly a far cry from germany or even the us where they've allowed whole areas to be overrun by foreigners who care not a whit for the existing culture.

but we, like every other post-industrial country, have used immigration as a band-aid. we import people because of our poor birth rates, but we never address the problem of our poor birth rates directly.

immigration is just kicking the can down the road. eventually, our immigrants will age too, and we will need to import ever more and ever younger people to maintain a manageable demographic ratio. eventually, the standards of living in other countries will rise high enough that we won't even be able to recruit as many people as we need.

how long can we go on draining the youth of other countries and replacing our own population with outsiders?

we keep kicking the can down the road for two reasons.

the first problem is economic. birth rates are incredibly hard to push upwards with government policy. hungary's birth rate has been *very* gradually increasing the past few years thanks to viktor orbán's generous pro-family policies. i don't know how much those policies cost, but i guarantee you that simply increasing immigration is cheaper.

and as the many commenters on here show, everyone in the west thinks like an economist now. people are just little cogs in an economy. you could replace everyone in canada with young sikh men, and the fact that canada is now a sikh nation would mean almost nothing to the economically-minded. \"so? it's still an economy, isn't it?\" culture, heritage and *oikos* don't generate enough tax revenue.

(note: i have nothing against sikh men in particular. i'm just making the point that a country of sikh men is not canada, unless you side with trudeau and insist that canada is just a big blank slate for the world to impose itself upon).

and the economic problem obviously exists at the micro-level of the family as well. who can afford to have three to five kids nowadays? when the economy was agrarian, having more kids was an insurance policy. now, having more kids is a liability.

but the problem goes beyond the economic. problem number two is spiritual. because in fact, lots of people could technically afford to have three to five kids, though it is obviously not as economically advantageous to do so nowadays. but they still don't.

people don't want to have more than a kid or two. hell, they don't want to have a kid at all. that would interfere with the plans to *see the world* and *live their best lives*. most people don't live spiritual lives and don't care about anything beyond their instant gratification. the idea of continuing their family, community, culture and the human race means nothing because they don't care about any of those things.

wine aunts write moronic opinion pieces about how their childless, hedonistic lifestyles should have no stigma attached to them. women who will one day discover they regret not raising a family moan about their meaningful careers in hr or whatever. pathetic men sit like lumps on logs and watch pornography and youtube videos about politics while their women are out bringing home the bacon. if they even muster the sense of duty to stay with any one woman. 

upper middle class people do better at making families and keeping them, but they too feel it is important not to stigmatize degenerate lifestyles of the lower classes and feel no obligation to have more than one or two kids themselves.

to the extent that people pretend to care about the future at all nowadays, they actually see the future as better with fewer people in it for environmental reasons, so there are really many strands of the zeitgeist that are working against the birth rate.

canadians, and western people more generally, need to find meaning in their lives again. meaning beyond instant gratification, that is. our nihilism is the reason for our cultural suicide, and our hedonism is our reason for valuing economics and killing social stigma over preserving and enhancing our own ways of right living, honouring our forebearers and creating a better world for our children.

but politicians can't give us meaning by themselves. there is no top-down solution, as much as we'd like one.

to try and bring my ramblings back to the point at hand, i am generally against mass immigration. i see how it is a band-aid to our problem of low birth rates, but i would gladly shave some points off the gdp to try and stimulate our own birth rates and ease off immigration.

to the extent that immigration should continue in the future in my ideal world, it should be for culturally compatible people who have jobs already lined up, and christians under duress elsewhere in the world who need our compassion.",liberals

my opinion is based on having watched trudeau spend his whole time in office only doing things that serve his image. so hearing at any point he's stepping back from responsibility or being hands off doesn't bode well. my opinion is formed from already seeing him as kind of useless. it's super pessimistic, i hope i'm proven wrong as time goes on, but at this point i don't think we have enough information to know for certain",liberals

my *impression* is that for appeals of this nature, cabinet is the only option and there isn't an independent group set up to adjudicate.  mr. geist is not insisting that due process must only be permitted through an appeal to cabinet, he's insisting that due process must be provided and my understanding is that currently no other due process mechanism exists, therefore that means cabinet appeals should be permitted.   presumably, if the lpc did all the work to set up a separate and independent group, that would work too.   the problem i can see is that's not exactly trivial.   it's not like you'd be seeing several appeals every quarter and keeping this group from regulatory capture (from either side) would be extremely difficult.  you could toss it over to the judiciary, but that may not be appropriate for the same reason you don't put every landlord tenant dispute right to court.   yes, they can go to court, but it does not follow that every dispute is within the purview of a court's jurisdiction.

but again, you'd have to read the actual expert, not my tea reading of what he's said.   mr. geist has never been an advocate for corporations.   even a cursory reading of his writings on copyright would put that claim into a shallow grave.

edit:
what i notice that no one is commenting on here is mr. geists' point about the issue with consultations and second reading.  the entire point of committee review is to make *better* legislation.  but as governments get more tired of having that pesky opposition around, they all seem to move more and more to a model of \"we do all our so-called consultation internally within our own party or even just cabinet and then we present a bill for the trained seals to pass without objection\".   (sometimes in omnibus form.)   

that's his larger point and no one is commenting on it.   i presume then that everyone agrees with his point that the lpc has given up on transparency.   (which, to be fair, seems kind of obvious at this point and it was something predicted from the beginning.   every prime minister who has come in promising transparency and openness changes their tune and it becomes obvious that they only mean that they other side should be transparent, but they themselves are trustworthy enough that everyone should accept their secrecy...  because it's different when they do it.)",liberals

good. vote for what you actually believe in. not what you pretend to believe in.

&gt;the more time goes on the more i start to realize that the conservative party only cares about empowering the white vote.

\"white\" has nothing to do with it. this whole tired dogma of \"whiteness\" is modern ideological cant with no substance. it was invented by racists a few hundred years ago. it did not exist before then, and there is no need for it now.

racial homogeneity definitely makes creating a trusting society easier, but it is by no means necessary. a strong belief system like christianity can mend all bridges and bring people together.

but modern people who talk about \"white\" and \"black\" subscribe to an ideology that only sows division, and they usually disdain the only types of belief systems powerful enough to bind diverse societies together. i.e., religions.

anyway, conservative parties can actually appeal quite strongly to certain immigrant populations, yes, even those of different skin colours!

but whether or not the conservative party of canada can bring us a good future regardless of your skin colour is highly doubtful, in my view. their future will be less bad than the lpc or ndp alternative, but those are our options: bad or worst. we need to go beyond politics for a better future.",conservatives

cabinets work as a team, this isn't uganda in the 1970's where idi amin was president, minister of defence, minister of justice, overlord of all the fishes in the sea and the beats on earth (yes, an actual title), and saviour of the nation all at the same time.

starting on page 17 they talk about the methods used for tracing... it's ridiculously confusing and the display of statistics is highly deceptive (on the domestic side they show domestic sources [50%] as a % of successfully traced firearms [29% of those submitted], on the smuggling side they show smuggled sources [10%] as a % ot *total firearms submitted* [100% of those submitted]).

one thing they mention is a negative result on a long gun tracing typically indicates it's sourced from canada... that seems rather suspect to me. we have importation records, business records, ownership records, and registration records (from when the lgr was around)... how is it harder to trace domestic than smuggled? makes no sense.",liberals

the reason moderna and pfizer aren't shipping from the us is because they have it in their contract with the us that the us would be entitled to the first x amount of doses made in their us plants.   for moderna, they aren't contractually allowed to export vaccines from their us plants until all options expire (up to 500 million) or the us waives that requirement (they will hopefully do so q2 or q3).  pfizer was at first planning on using their us plants to supply the globe in q2, until the us struck a deal around christmastime for extra doses in exchange for priority access to certain components.  make note, this is also what the uk does with astrazeneca, it doesn't technically ban exports, it just has it in their contracts that those specific plants are prioritized for uk use for x amount of doses.

pfizer was almost definitely unwilling to give the eu the same contract, in which prioritized it's belgium plant for eu production at the expense of everyone else, because that plant was always planned to be pfizer's global workhorse.  pfizer set up production and the amount of production they did there, with the expectation that they could use it to fullfill their international orders.   if eu came down hard and didn't allow exports, it would absolutely screw other countries over as well as pfizer.  eu would be retaliated against, and pharma companies would think twice before investing in production inside the eu again.   pfizer was already talking about shifting production.  think of it this way.   moderna specifically chose the swiss company lonza to set up its manufacturing.  this was a good decision for switzlerland as it's a huge investment into their pharma industry.  as a result, moderna set up plants in switzerland in order to lead it's global supply effort.   countries made purchases with moderna with moderna expecting and making commitments based on that swiss plant being operational and it's global supply hub.   now, if switzerland said \"we want all the vaccines that come from that plant!\" tomorrow, it would mess over so many plans.

and we live in a globalized world, and while yes, vaccine nationalism is a thing, it's not something that should be applauded, especially when the countries practicing vaccine nationalism are the very same ones that have been the drivers and biggest arguers pushing towards globalization and espousing the benefits of comparative advantage.  like, i don't think it's a good thing if we tell pfizer, in order to supply the world, you need a plant in every single country....",liberals

[here is a pdf of what tps calls a crime gun or domestically sourced crime gun](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://dennisryoung.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/toronto-police-foip-crime-gun-stats-2007-2017-aug-24-2018.pdf&amp;hl=en_us)

here is an post talking about the repot here are the highlights

  1. the tps definition of ‘crime gun’ is over-inclusive:

there four conditions in classifying a gun as a “crime gun,” but only the first is reasonable.

• any firearm that has been used or suspected to have been used in a criminal offence;  
• any firearm that is obtained, possessed, or intended to be used to facilitate criminal activity;  
• any firearm that has had a serial number removed, altered or obliterated;  
• any weapon that has been adapted for use as a firearm

my comments: the first point in the tps definition of “crime gun” accords with the classic international definition of “crime gun,” but adding the other points in the definition includes things that are not even guns as well as paper crimes.

more specifically:

• point 2: “any firearm that is obtained, possessed, or intended to be used to facilitate criminal activity;”  
comment: this would include the “criminal activity” of not having a pal or unsafe storage; these are non-violent acts, paper crimes;

point 3: “any firearm that has had a serial number removed, altered or obliterated.” comment: this would also include weapons captured during previous wars, brought home as souvenirs, and kept peacefully at home until seized by police if the owner violates a paper crime such as unsafe storage.

• point 4: “any weapon that has been adapted for use as a firearm;”

comment: this would include fingers, bananas, or sticks hidden inside a pocket if used to threaten a victim. legally, threatening someone with any hidden object is considered to be a “dangerous weapon,” but such objects should not be considered “crime guns.” obviously, fingers or sticks inside pockets are “domestically sourced.”

2. the tps definition of ‘domestically sourced crime gun’ also has multiple conditions and is over-inclusive::

the tps definition of “domestically sourced crime gun,” is “any gun that is registered in canada, has been reported stolen, was made in canada, or was legally imported into canada. non-regulated items (e.g., air guns), firearms with no serial numbers, and firearms that are too old are unable to be sourced.”

my comments: the first point is legitimate, but it is difficult to understand why “non-regulated items” – objects that are not even firearms — are automatically called ‘crime guns” or “domestically sourced.”

it is not reasonable to categorize firearms considered to be too old or unable to be sourced to be “domestically sourced.” this means that military heirlooms — guns brought back after ww i or the boer war — are “domestically sourced.”

note added later: friendly critics have objected to my interpretation of the definition of “domestically sourced crime guns” as including “non-regulated items.” the police may in fact exclude them. attempts to clarify the definition with the tps have not yet been successful.

another factor that this article seems to dismiss is another blind spot of the ndp's: the rat's nest of jurisdictional issues. it's conceivable that such a plan would end up being another wrangle like the carbon pricing backstop, whereby provinces would develop their own metrics and the feds would only step in as a last resort. the dauphin experiment a lot of people bring up was, afaik, developed by the provincial government of manitoba. doug ford was responsible for canceling the ontario project. justin trudeau had no say in the matter. as well, the subject of whether this could help disabled people -- there is no federal master database of disabled people. so much is handled by the provinces, and the premiers are crying foul even now, during a pandemic, about *anything* the feds want to do to help.

i mean, that match was ridic for all kinds of reasons. however, it is pleasing how quickly *that* particular handle withered and died on the vine. 

i was never clear on why ppl thought the match would go any other way. obviously the guy who has boxed for *years* is going have the advantage, even if it was a charity match for funsies.",liberals

sure, it can be used metaphorically to mean \"remove someone from power\". but that metaphorical meaning only exists because literal defenestration is how a bunch of historical political leaders were removed from power.

i don't think many people can seriously look at gerry's post and believe it's likely to cause violence.

but, at the same time, maybe this isn't the week to use metaphorical phrases with their roots in the violent overthrow of political leaders.",conservatives
