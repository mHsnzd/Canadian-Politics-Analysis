the liberal government opened the door for more inclusive leadership roles for women and bipoc. the 2015 cabinet was ahead of its time. in 2021, main, bay, and wall street are now working to ensure their leadership teams involve diverse backgrounds.

&gt;claims to be for the middle class, yet has allowed housing prices to skyrocket (through weak accounting disclosure laws) and has imposed new taxes on the middle class, including a home equity tax. 

canadian housing prices have been climbing for decades, well b4 the liberals came into power. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_property_bubble

the home equity tax is just for flippers that live in a house for less than 12 months. this won't apply to most canadians.

in fact, under the conservative plan, real estate investors will get to defer capital gains on rental properties. they will get to bid for replacement properties using pre-tax dollars while middle class families can only use after-tax dollars to bid for a home. that will only escalate house prices.

canada is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. it's ahead of france, uk, germany, us to name a few.

&gt;toronto and montreal having some of the longest lockdowns in the world.

at some point, adults need to take responsibility for their own behaviour. if you don't want to take covid seriously, people get sick and overwhelm the healthcare system, and hence the lockdown implemented by provincial governments.

&gt;fiscal irresponsibility that lead to canada adding the most amount of debt per capita, not surprised considering he \"doesn't think about monetary policy\"

covid caused the entire global economy to shut down. economically, canada hasn't faced a drop in gdp this bad since the great depression. gdp declined by about 5.5% during covid. the great recession was a cake walk in comparison.

the only option for all world governments was to flood main street with cash in the form of support programs. world governments had learned from the great depression that austerity doesn't work in times of crisis. yes, inflation is generated but it's a hell of a lot better than seeing millions of citizens in soup lines and being evicted or having their mortgages foreclosed. a hell of a lot more businesses would have been foreclosed and a lot more personal suffering would have occurred if world governments didn't take swift action. inflation doesn't just exist in canada which many fail to acknowledge. it exists in europe, us, and asia as a result of the pandemic. we live in a global economy and the entire supply chain grounded to a halt.

&gt;numerous ethical breaches (aga kahn, we charity) numerous pr scandals (black face photo, alleged groping allegation)insensitive behaviour and gaffes

the federal government is made up of more than one individual. there are numerous departments, countless procedures, and many checks and balances. canadians don't care about trudeau. they only care about themselves and what their government will do for them in their hour of need.

&gt;calling an election during the 4th wave of a pandemic which the majority of canadians didn't want

most minority governments end in about 2 years because they are inherently unstable.

&amp;#x200b;

we may be able to reduce the number of infected/spreading down via vaccination and various restrictions but the thing is every time we've had a chance to stamp out the virus we've failed. we've had several opportunities to do so during the summer time for example when cases were low and we reduced restrictions during that time which allowed for the virus to survive.

&amp;#x200b;

at this point, it's looking like the latest version of covid will become extremely widespread very quickly (over 4000 cases in ontario, was like 3100 the previous day i think).

&amp;#x200b;

fundamentally we do not have an effective quarantine ability as a province and as a nation. the virus spreads easily and quickly in a low-income type of housing because it generally consists of a lot of people living in a small space breathing in the same air with ventilation systems that are not good enough or non-existing. our quarantine measures seem to be \"go home and stay home\" rather than a \"you are going to have to come with us and we will make sure you have a safe place to stay for the next few weeks\" approach. the few quarantine approaches that we have put in place (i.e. feds using hotel rooms) have seen their share of serious problems.",liberals

another factor will be the certain loss in valuation of the $cdn.  a low $ relative to the $us always has good and bad sides.  it greatly increases the cost of imports,  the upside is that it benefits our national exports.  

but whoa, what do we make and who do we sell it to? our largest customer by far is still the usa, who have clearly served notice  that our business relationship is changing, and not in our favour .  that reality won’t be changed with  new regimes in america.  our big exports like oil&amp;gas, automotive, lumber- all under threat .  

china is at number 2 for canada, all our business there is at risk.  europe is going to buy all they possibly can from each other, not from us.  india  is a massive potential market but our relationship  remains toxic.

but all is not lost , not at all, for this government .  they are excellent at managing the electorate , have a terrific social media presence, and  no difficulty manipulating  a weakly organized  opposition .  they have a young, attractive , bilingual new leader selected to lead us out of the situation and will  introduce us when it suits .   it won’t be difficult to distract us from noticing who made a major contribution to getting us in the mess.  business as usual .",liberals

i understand that canadians can run into financial trouble because they used up too much credit and interest rates go up. i understand that they could lose a significant amount of income and that lack of tax income could hurt the government and force them to borrow.

but how is this specifically the government's fault? shouldn't we be blaming the people who are using up that credit for investing poorly? or maybe the banks who are lending out all that credit and didn't do their research either? 

sure they could have done a better job regulating, but i think that we're glossing over something really important. we're mixing up the availability of private and public credit here, and the reality is that the private sector will experience financial trouble way before the public sector should there be interest rate increases.

we shouldn't be paying for the risks that people make on speculative investments.",liberals

what trudeau did do was overspend on this crisis by basically twice what he needed to, if i look at europe.    this erodes our future ability to respond to other crises.  in the shorter term, it dilutes the government's abilities to institute new programs.  there will likely be a slow burn of cuts to social programs for the next decade or so, like canada was forced to do in the 90s. 

 stop pretending this is about some catastrophe, it's not.  saying everything isnt collapsing and therefore debt has no impact on society is wrong.   it's about a generation living through cuts, which i feel isnt healthy for anyone. it means the government's programs wont be as flexible responding to the times.  it will harm many people as future governments' fiscal flexibility is eroded.   all to win this next election.  spending far more than needed was not optimal.  the europeans show it could have  been done with less spending, without spiralling fatalities.",liberals

that statement implies someone in a position to do so has actually tried, or that the government has ever had a senate reform agenda. but neither of those things is true.

the government appointed a bunch of independent senators, but hasn't taken any position on the senate reform file itself, instead saying \"that's for senators to figure out for themselves.\" but it's a giant and nebulous question, and one piece in a long list of non-government business in a chamber whose rules don't create consistent time for non-government business. and that's before you factor in divergent opinions and the senate's internal divisions.

if the government had an honest-to-god senate reform agenda (e.g. a sweeping set of rule changes backed by amendments to the parliament of canada act), that would be different. they could appoint a senator to be the minister responsible for the reforms, drive the necessary debates forward on the order paper, and wrangle enough senators together to vote for the changes. it isn't hard to do if it's a priority.",conservatives

i'm a woman myself, and thankfully most of my female family members are more conservative-minded or centrist, though only recently did some of us start to regularly vote conservative - most, including myself, have long been swing voters. part of it is because, let's not kid ourselves here, if you're a social conservative in any fashion, there is basically no major party that will do anything meaningful on issues you care about, including the conservatives. a few of us realized that a long time ago, and so we'd vote based on other issues, depending on what the platforms and issues of the time were. that meant we didn't always vote conservative.

in a more broad sense, though? wokeism has gone totally off the rails, and dragged a lot of women with it. i think a big part of it is that feminism has gone super woke and that means a lot of women are basically walking around with a big target on their backs. *we* are one of their big target audiences, and so they tailor a lot of their garbage to sound like it's in our best interest. most people are not super into keeping tabs on the news from a variety of sources, and even fewer will have the critical thinking skills necessary to notice some of the subtle ways in which they're being manipulated *without* having that variety of sources. this is all the more true if the issues at hand play into something a person has vulnerabilities around - like experiences of sexism or racism, for example, and that gets even worse given the trend to take any negative feeling or small slight and turn it into a social justice cause. i think this goes for a lot of groups that are the target of some big ideological push, and in this case it just happens to be women, targeted by a huge woke feminist wave. that's my theory, anyway.",conservatives

lol - i appreciate you making my case for me, but i'm quite capable, i asked you to make your case.

so you have failed to make any argument for your original statement. i tell you what,  lets make it easier - just give examples, one for each. we've got john a -  obviously a traditional conservative. which of his actions represents each of the things you mentioned?

&gt;this is because the \"modern conservatism\" you speak of is just forms of liberalism. you have the classical liberals, and you have the neo-liberals.

sorry - wrong again.  modern conservativism does share many similarities with classic liberalism. they're not the same, but they're similar. but that's about where it ends. 

sorry - modern conservatism isn't neo-liberal conservatism. here's a short document outlining the differences between the three. 

https://ourpolitics.net/traditional-conservatism-vs-modern-conservatism-neo-conservatism/

so as you can see, you were wrong off the bat. 

but you were wrong for another reason as well, you're assuming that conservative models in canada and the us are the same. and they're not. you can't simply interchange them as you seem to want to. 

so you're either wrong once or twice depending on how you look at it. 

&gt;so the modern conservatism you speak of is mainly a outshoot of liberalism

no, as we have just seen you completely misunderstood that. modern conservatism is an evolution of classical - it just suggests that the gov't should remove itself from the social element and rely on free market forces to resolve many of the issues that others might want the gov't to be in control of. 

so - swing and a miss

&gt;again, can you read? im not talking about your version of \"modern conservatism\" 

so your question is, can i read what you wrote after i said what you're commenting on before i wrote what you're commenting on :)  roflmao  no. no i can't  :0  you're not terribly bright are you  ;) that's really not how reading works :)

and we've seen your definition is wrong anyway. so.

&gt;most poor countries value community, religion, familily, health and tradition.

that doesn't make them conservative in the slightest. like - at all. are you seriously trying to claim that communist russia was a conservative society? nope.

&gt;in addition, please dont give me the \"they are poor because they are left wing.\" there are many times that this is true,

so dont' give you the thing that you think is true. gotcha. 

&gt;i dont think you understood what i said.

i guarantee you didn't. 

so - here we are at the end.  and once again  - not only did you turn out to be wrong in what you did say - you did not make your case at all for what you originally said. 

all you did is misinterpret some definitions and get confused - but you did not defend your original points at all. 

which strongly suggests that you can't. seeing as this is about the third time or more i've asked. and the reason seems to be a lack of education on your part as to the issues involved given your errors. but  - you could at least try. 

so lets go back to it - here's what you claimed:

there are actual studies that you are looking at which claim we're going to have resource issues globally by 2030. where are those?

which studies are saying that multiculturalism or inclusivity etc are particularly hard on resources? how are you making that argument?

traditional conservatism is absolutely not effective in a changing world. traditional conservatism seeks very slow change and the preservation of the status quo. you yourself have posted references saying that. so - what is your argument in favour of it being the most effective way of addressing changing times?

so - you've done a great job dodging that - can you defend that or were you just full of shit from the get go?",liberals

they said they were mandate that every mp in the house needs to be vaccinated or that every mp in their party needs to be vaccinated? i'm pretty sure it's the latter, in which case people voting for potentially unvaccinated mps wouldn't have needed to worry about their mp not being able to sit in the house.

&gt;and the cpc had basically no shot at a majority 

not really relevant.

&gt;then they shouldn't have voted for a party that refused to make it a requirement.

let's make something crystal clear, they should've voted for the party that represented their views the best, full stop.

&gt;the risk when you vote for a party pandering to anti-vaxxers is that you might be voting for an anti-vaxxer.

representatives are imperfect, and there's always a 'risk' that you'll vote for someone who disagrees with you on something important, it's unavoidable unless you wrap yourself up so much in a political party that it becomes your identity and you just agree with everyone they do on principle.
