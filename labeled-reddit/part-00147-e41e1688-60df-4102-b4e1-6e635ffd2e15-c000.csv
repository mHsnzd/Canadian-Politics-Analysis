hif3iua,2021-10-28T05:22:48.000-07:00,"john ivison: blue liberals are seeing red over new trudeau cabinet come on, ivison.  i know deadlines exist, but hanging an entire \"people think x\" story on anonymous quotes is a bit beneath a reputable publication.  to go in approximate order:

&gt;&gt; “they (the current leadership) are vandalizing the economy,” said one senior liberal (a shopworn phrase that in this case is justified.)

does this imply that the source of the quote is very old, or is the 'shopworn phrase' instead \"vandalizing the economy?\"  if the latter, this is meaningless hyperbole.  if the former, then all it tells me is that the speaker is likely out of active politics.  but if that's the case, then why withhold their name?

&gt;&gt; “this is canada’s first ndp prime minister,” said one [liberal]

again, this is a quote trading on the reputation of an anonymous person.  if i took out a party membership card and dm'd nasty quotes to ivison, would he run my opinion as unsourced fact? 

&gt;&gt; “the only pro-business thing trudeau has ever done is legalize weed,” said one mp.

note the sleight of hand here: ivison doesn't specify that this was a _liberal_ mp with the pithy quote.  dissent in caucus would indeed be newsworthy, but it's not even confirmed here.

&gt;&gt; it is impossible to gauge how widespread the discontent is within liberal circles 

yes it is possible?  you can look at opinion polls of liberal members/supporters and evaluate their satisfaction for trudeau and/or the new cabinet.  i'm not sure if any such polls have been conducted yet, but it's certainly _possible_.

throwing up one's hands just abdicates journalistic responsibility.

&gt;&gt;  it’s clear that the new cabinet offered an opportunity to reboot the relationship with the private sector. that has been squandered.

this is begging the question that the disgruntled liberals speak for 'the private sector.'  that might be true, but without better biographical data (even still preserving privacy for those who really can't go on the record) we have to take ivison on faith.

&gt;&gt; beatty noted that the bank of canada downgraded its expectations of growth on wednesday, while almost doubling its inflation projection. he asked if this is a temporary blip or something more serious.

from the [bank of canada monetary policy report](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mpr-2021-10-27.pdf) (pdf, page 11), the downgrade is largely due to global supply disruptions and \"weaker foreign demand.\"  if ivison thinks that liberal policies are somehow responsible for these, then he doesn't make that case in this article.

&gt;&gt; when guilbeault was asked if he means to block new projects in the oilsands, he said the federal government has no jurisdiction over production, only over emissions.

&gt;&gt; “we will ensure through legislation or regulation, that’s something we need to develop, that emissions from oil and gas are capped at current levels and diminish over time,” he said.

&gt;&gt; the answer, in other words, was effectively, yes.

in this quote: guilbeault doesn't give the answer that ivision wants, so he supplements the authentic statement with his own opinion.

\"we will cap emissions\" is only a rejection of all future development if there is no way to reduce the emissions-intensity of oil sands production.  the [policies of the harper government](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/pm-plans-intensity-alternative-to-kyoto/article18174848/) held otherwise fifteen years ago.

maybe the oil sands really have reduced emissions as far as is technically possible, so there is a true tradeoff in the future.  if that's the case, then _a better article could have made this point_.

&gt;&gt; natural gas has been viewed by many as a bridge fuel until renewable fuel production ramps up. the prospect of shortages has driven up global demand for gas but guilbeault said there will be no dispensation for a fossil fuel that emits much less carbon dioxide when combusted than oil or coal.

remember, a key critique of the liberal environmental policy is that the federal government only counts 'upstream' emissions, which occur in canada.  once we sell oil or natural gas abroad, our accounting holds that the carbon emissions from burning the fuel is the problem of the purchasing nation.

and even domestically, ivison fails to argue how replacing our remaining coal electric generation with natural gas is incompatible with capping emissions at current levels and decreasing them over time.

&gt;&gt; timothy egan, president of the canadian gas association, said a huge focus for producers is innovative work to reduce emissions. [...] \"witness the flow of investment out of energy markets around the world [...]. citizens around the world are hurting because they don’t have the energy they need and they don’t have that energy because of policy choices by governments.\"

hold up here.  if investment is flowing \"out of energy markets around the world,\" then how is this a canada-specific problem?

worse yet, even in the best case we don't produce the marginal, price-setting barrel of oil.  it's not at all obvious that a more favourable federal cabinet would do much of anything to change these global-scale problems.

&gt;&gt; egan said his members will wait to see what the plans of the re-elected government are. “we remain committed to working responsibly with them,” he said. but the industry’s exasperation is apparent.

again, ivision follows an anodyne \"no comment\" quote with his own opinion.

&gt;&gt; canada’s economy has relied on the energy and autos sectors to pay our bills. supply chain issues have seen prices for oil, gas and autos spike but the long-term future is much less assured.

note that this is an argument _against_ a pivot towards the oil sector.  if prices are inflated because of short to medium-term supply-chain disruptions, then new investment could come online just in time to be unprofitable.

&gt;&gt;  but the fear is that as competition for investment heats up, canada is going to miss out.

fear from whom?  it'd be great if ivison could get someone of note on the record to support his claims here, but once again he repeats a mix of personal opinion and unsourced rumours.  there has to be someone not directly affiliated with partisan politics who laments the lack of (here) a canadian battery factory.

&gt;&gt; carolyn wilkins, the former senior deputy governor of the bank of canada, told the coalition for a better future summit in ottawa on wednesday, that canada has been falling behind its peers in terms of economic growth per capita in recent years because of weak productivity.

&gt;&gt; [...] but [the liberal] government has been part of the problem – an inhibitor of productivity-enhancing investment and a drag on growth.

productivity is a tricky thing.

ironically, the covid lockdowns have done wonders for canadian labour productivity, through the simple observation that lockdowns preferentially shuttered low-wage, low-margin jobs.

in the long run, ivison is again begging the question that the likely liberal economic policy is bad for productivity.  his most concrete claims relate to the oil sands, but productivity in resource extraction does not easily generalize to the rest of the economy &amp;ndash; particularly when ghg agreements mean that the oil industry has a ticking clock, whether it be years or decades.

productivity is industry specific, and there doesn't seem to be a magic, central economic formula to follow no matter how much politicians and columnists wish for one.  i'm open to the idea that the liberal government hasn't been great for productivity, but we all deserve a better argument than the vague allusions that ivision makes here.",liberals

as time goes on, moderates and undecideds  also become less and less willing to back the cpc each election because the reform/paleoconservative elements scare them away. this makes it very difficult for the cpc to expand its base and win elections with them there. 

basically if the party moderates on social and climate issues and tells them to suck it up, the end result would be the socons migrating to the ppc. though by the same token getting rid of them would allow the cpc to grow it's base and likely form majorities again, while the ppc would occupy a similar position to the old federal social credit party. the issue right now is that even when you have leaders like o'toole trying to modernize the party, the fact that they're still trying to pander to the reformers and letting them maintain a position of power in the party is enough to prevent the cpc's base from expanding, which keeps them in their current limbo. 

so basically the only two options are modernize and eventually lose them, or keep them and loose moderate support.",conservatives

this seems to be the key claim of the article, but it isn't substantiated well.

quick [google](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/energy-resources/moltex_-_watss_-_nuclear_waste_reduction.pdf) finds reports that moltex's objective is precisely the opposite of what was claimed here.

&gt;moltex has invented an extraordinary new method for economically converting spent conventional nuclear waste into 
fuel for its fast spectrum molten salt reactor, known as watss (waste to stable salt). the moltex stable salt reactor 
wasteburner (ssr-w) utilises spent candu fuel (or any oxide fuel) converted to chloride form to produce low cost 
electricity.  
 
&gt;moltex energy is developing the capability to power reactors by extracting the remaining fuel from the thousands of tons 
of spent fuel around the world using watss. conventional radioactive waste is radioactive for circa 300,000 years if the 
plutonium and higher actinides are left in the spent fuel. to handle this huge and toxic liability, governments have set 
aside tens of $billions, but this liability can be reduced or even turned into an asset, once converted into ssr fuel. this 
asset will be able to create vast amounts of incremental energy and produce waste that will then take only 300 years to 
decay, reducing the scale of geological repository sites.  
 
&gt;fuel produced in this way is expected to be cheaper than conventional nuclear fuel produced by mining and enrichment 
of uranium. it also removes the plutonium in the spent fuel permanently from the risk of it being stolen and used for 
nuclear weapons. this reduces the overall proliferation risk of nuclear power. 

&gt; conventional reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel was developed to produce high purity plutonium and is thus a serious 
nuclear proliferation risk. it is also so expensive that it is never done for commercial reasons. the watss fuel conversion 
technology transforms this picture. it vastly simplifies the process, so a single apparatus the size of a billiard table is 
predicted to process as much spent nuclear fuel as the thorp plant at sellafield - which is the size of a soccer pitch (and 
even more expensive than the players who play on it). importantly, the ssr fuel output of this process does not approach anything close to the purity needed for weapons use. this level of purification would require a traditional multibillion 
dollar reprocessing plant.

nope. not at all. get vaxxed and your staff as well and go about your business. period.

there's no defending this logically. it's like trying to come up for a really good reason why rape should be ok. sorry, no.

so you have a few groups and people just absolutely flooding the system to such an unreasonable degree making it completely backlogged, costing the tax payers millions and forcing the government to make changes.

if layton stays, the only thing i see is a bit more division of the vote between libs and ndp and quebec is not giving the same vote of confidence again for the simple reason it didn’t worked the first time clearly the rest of the country didn’t showed much interest the first time.

ndp doesn’t lose all its advances there, but it’s still not enough to turn aways the less progressive libs that took a chance on the ndp the first time from going back to the libs. so even if the ndp make some advances in the rest of the country he’s still losing most of his gains in quebec, not all mind you with mulcair they still retained 16 of those 59 (which are today back to 1 by the way), but even if they kept lets say 30 or 35 they still have to make up the difference in the rest of the country + other gains to even get a chance to win that election which i just don’t see happening.",liberals

hkai15x,2021-11-11T11:53:35.000-08:00,"what do western provinces actually want besides changes to equalization and selling oil? you need to understand that for the west, these problems have been going on for generations. 

for a very very long time for example it cost more to ship products east on the rail lines than it did to ship west - specifically to make sure western provinces couldn't sell products competatively in the east while eastern companies could sell competatively in the west. that is one example of many where the policies of the federal gov't were set to buy votes in the east because the west had no powers. 

in the end, what the west really wants is more control over it's own fortunes and laws.  the west as a group tends to disagree with  the east on gun control, taxation, freedom of speech, spending priorities, energy, and a lot of other things but ontario and quebec vote in a gov't and the west has to live with them forcing issues down their throats. consider the nep, which trudeau (the first one) brought in to buy votes in the east and keep the west from growing strong financially - according to his own people. 

so in essence the west wants less federal powers and intererence, less taking money from the west to buy votes in the east, and the ability to set policy that is in keeping with western beliefs and not having to follow laws or policy that is specific to the benefit of the east. 

it's wrong that a geographic half of a country should be at the mercy of the other half who abuses that power for their own gain.",liberals

are you deliberately being a moron? no it does not. it requires them putting some names on some paper. they don't even need to live in the riding. it requires nearly zero effort. hell one of the easiest things to do is have a riding association in each riding and they've been shutting those down left and right. how can you take their running a candidate seriously when they don't even have a riding association in the area? and most of the others are just shells.

after he lost he tried to get a seat in a byelection and got like 3 percent of the vote.

the rhino party used to run in pretty much every riding. are you claiming they were a serious party?  (although i did like their proposal to build a bridge to hawaii to improve tourism.)

&gt;very recently - yes - they've been contestants and had impacts in the past.

yes and back then they polled twice as high as they're polling now. but you're comparing the ppc to now. so... 

&gt;yeah we will see what happens - there's certainly a reason why the cpc sicked kinsella on a smear campaign of bernier and the ppc - as they were worried about them stealing votes from them.

sure. turned out it was completely unnecessary tho didn't it. i mean the guy has zero traction. 

&gt;yeah the cpc aren't going to out liberal the liberals.

they don't need to at all. the libs are pretty far to the left. there's a lot of people who are center, center-right and even center-left who will happily vote for a right of center party for a lot of their policy. they often prefer the financial policy. if there's a few left leaning policies in there as well or ones that appeal to both sides of the isle it's not hard to snatch them up. 
certainly it's not hard to replace the tiny number who leave for the ppc. 

&gt;you can downplay that - but it is an accomplishment 

it isn't at all. it means you found 338 people willing to have their names put on a piece of paper. it was slightly more impressive that he opened some riding associations (which requires damn near zero effort but does take some), but he's had to shut them down, suggesting they weren't real to begin with, just shells. probably most of the rest are as well. 

in comparison the greens look well organized and well funded. which is pretty pathetic. 

bernier is a fake whos running around looking for donations to pay his wage. and we haven't heard from him since the last election except to get himself arrested protesting a matter of provincial jurisdiction. when lizzie does it it's kind of cute, but for him it's just embarrassing.",liberals

i also want to add that on the government side it truly gets complicated.  the canadian blood services is a arms length agency. it was created by a memorandum of understanding between the provinces and the federal government. the feds don’t have the ability to completely control their operations, and this falls into one of the stickiest jurisdictional splits. the minister doesn’t have the authority on this one to mandate the change. it was also set up to explicitly safeguard against another tainted blood scare. their entire organization has the mentality of safety over quantity. it’s been viewed as incredibly bad form to legislate the agency to do otherwise as parliament shouldn’t wade into what should be left to scientists and experts when it comes to the safety of the national bloody supply. 

trudeau’s liberals have actually pushed them to make some rather significant changes (in the scale of their organization) since 2015. there was an all out ban on msm blood donating blood, which got dropped to a 5 year memorandum, to a 1 year, to now 3 months. progress is being made on this file, but it will continue to take progressive pressure on the government level as well as continuous reviews of scientific evidence in order to eventually remove the ban completely.

h79li5m,2021-07-31T11:34:35.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access sorry - been busy.

&gt;has the mother of a terminated pregnancy ever been charged in canada for this when abortion was illegal?

yes. [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2277356) is an article which is paywalled, but the abstract isn't. (i also can't access the article, but the named woman can probably be researched in more detail).

&gt; i think my original point about fear mongering is that canada is so far away from prosecuting mothers for miscarriages with literally no law on the books regarding abortion that it is fear mongering stating advocating for any restrictions will lead to mothers being charged for miscarriages. 

i don't know if you're a woman/feminist/whatever; but over the past 20 years, i've seen bc/abortion rights in the us be crippled. an issue that we all assumed was finished with roe v wade in '73. i do not believe that social progress is linear and that freedoms are guaranteed anymore. 

&gt;canada is one of the few countries that literally has no law on abortion since the last law was struck down in 1988.

which means that a right-leaning party in a majority government could write something without having to amend or change anything; it would then need to be challenged and head over the the scc. i know it is more than unlikely here, but the fact that there is no law puts it in a legal gray zone. i prefer a strong law which protects my rights to none existing at all.

&gt;when a dysfunctional country like el salvador is the example i don't think that's a genuine example.

el salvador is relevant when we talk about how laws can become more oppressive over time. they had a more generous law regarding the permissible situations wherein an abortion can be performed (from 1973: an abortion could be legally allowed under three major conditions: if the pregnant woman's life was endangered and abortion was the only means to preserve it, if her pregnancy had resulted from rape or statutory rape, or if a serious congenital disorder was detected in the fetus.), and then they wrote a superseding law in 1998 which banned all abortions, and then, worse, in 1999, they amended their constitution to grant citizenship rights at conception - total legal regression for women. it's possible, and it happens. the fact that it's happening in a developing nation does not mean that the example doesn't count.

&gt;european countries actually have stricter laws on abortion than canada and i'm pretty sure mothers in most of western europe where those restrictions are in place aren't charged when they have miscarriages.

no, you're right there - or, at least, i can't find record of modern examples. i found many historical examples, including those mentioned in [this thesis paper](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1187032776&amp;disposition=inline).

&gt;for the other examples you gave in the us that could enable prosecution - have those fears been realized?

it doesn't need to be continually realized through a steady stream of prosecutions; it's political theatre, after all. however, it is a *de jure* restriction and challenge of a woman's control over her body. it is meant to legally restrict women, and it's meant to decrease the number of abortions. we look at these laws, and they have a clear motive. 

let me put it into another form; the book twelve years a slave is the story of a free-born black man who, due to the fact that slavery was still legal in the united states, was able to be captured and sold in another state. that kind of activity (re-enslavement of free blacks) wasn't common, but it happened, and it was allowed to happen because of the law. 

&gt;that clearly wasn't the intent of the laws -

i don't know what the intent was. we'd have to ask a legal scholar for virginia.

&gt;but i'm almost certain there would be a good number of people who feel they need to be pro-choice to the point where they are unwilling to reform a law that would allow that sort of a murder to happen

which is bad path, politically. i would hope that if virginia sought to close that loophole, they did so extremely carefully. do i trust them to do so? [no, they have already proven they cannot be trusted to support a woman's right to choose.](https://acluva.org/en/news/virginias-trap-laws-do-not-protect-patient-health-and-safety-simply-legislate-and-regulate). from another article on the aclu website: 
&gt;between 2009 and 2016, the number of medical facilities providing abortion care declined by more than half—making it progressively more difficult and expensive for people seeking abortions to access care. over 92 percent of virginia cities or counties have no abortion provider, and the remaining facilities are clustered in five urban areas—leaving large swaths of the state with no access. 

i simply have no trust in the way the usa is drifting rightwards that they will be able to continue providing women's rights to bc and abortion.

&gt;if it's legal to do - then it's effectively okay. proportional self defense that results in the death of an assailant is okay as long as it is proportional. both morally and legally.

maybe we're arguing semantically; it's not \"legal\" - causing the death of another is always a homicide, but there are cases where you would explain an event as a \"non-culpable homicide\" (see criminal code [here](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-51.html#doccont)) and so it would not be a criminal offense, but it's not legal to do a homicide. :)

&gt;that kind of goes without saying - we have no fault divorce so any reason is acceptable for a divorce.
