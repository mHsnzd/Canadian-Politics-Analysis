as for steve harper and his glorious reign as pm, he was definitely a big c conservative.  at least in rhetoric and his ability to piss off the leftists.  but how conservative was he really?  he ran on the promise of eliminating our beloved gst, followed that course for a while, then promptly combined it with provincial sales taxes and acted like he was doing us a huge favour in doing so.  if you put the rhetoric aside, harper was still a politician.  the reputation those people have was not made up out of thin air, just for the record.

and speaking of the gst, that tax was not introduced by a liberal government.  the last time a government provided a balanced budget, it was also not a conservative government.  yes i know it was a pretty creative balancing act, but no other party before or since has even tried.",conservatives

the bc ndp wouldn't win back power again until that socred coalition fractured in 1991, and they only barely won in 1996 (losing the popular vote to gordon campbell's bc liberals). those election losses resulted in bad government by right-wing parties who caused considerable suffering to vulnerable people. at the federal level there is a centrist party that regularly governs. the same is true in ontario, quebec, and elsewhere. in bc and alberta, there is no such party. either the ndp wins or right-wingers do bad stuff. there is a real moral obligation, if you believe in left-wing politics, to try to *win elections* in those contexts.

as an interesting historical note, the bc ndp/ccf has won the popular vote in exactly three elections: 1972, 1991, and 2020. only in 2020 was their vote total not exceeded by that of two major parties to their right.

&gt; will we be able to say the same for notley's ndp government

part two of my critique of this article would be pointing to the real achievements of the notley government. just offhand, they introduced a $15/hr minimum wage, a *carbon tax in alberta*, and progressive taxation (previously income tax had been flat in alberta). progressive income tax is literally point #2 of the communist manifesto, doesn't get much more socialist than that.

they also spent money on health and social care at a time when it would have been much easier to point to the collapsing oil revenues and ballooning deficit and make cutbacks.

&gt;again, on the first ballot of the 174,404 **votes** cast for the cpc leadership, 70,295 went to socially conservative candidates (lewis and sloan), that’s about 40% of **the vote**. in terms of points, lewis and sloan got a combined 34.88%. small percent of the party, huh?


i was talking about the votes when i said 40%. i went on to give the combined percentage of **points** they got as well. go back to wikipedia and look at the \"votes cast\" table for the first round and you will find the numbers i was speaking of, the wikipedia article literally confirms what i said above. how can you not understand this? lewis got 24.67% of the votes cast in the first round and sloan got 15.64%. 24.67 + 15.64 = 40.31. it's right in the tables in that wiki article, go and look.

1. there's really not much more the federal government can do on this issue. bold rhetoric might get him good headlines in the english media, but in real terms \"taking a stand\" doesn't really matter when it's a bill within quebec's jurisdiction, and one would hope that the federal government's opinion wouldn't matter to the judiciary.

2. alienating quebec is more than just a matter of risking their 10 seats, it's a matter of making a powerful enemy in françois legault. should o'toole ever become pm, being on legault's bad books won't help.

3. the bloc would be another powerful enemy to make. unless the cpc wins a majority anytime soon, which i think is quite unlikely, they will need the bloc's support to form government. the bloc generally prefers not to pick favourites and in a minority situation, just votes in confidence with the largest party - but explicitly opposing bill 21 would likely change that.

and yet it wasnt just the right wing media talking about it. sure, the right wing haters will always be trying to set a scandal on fire, but in this case it only actually caught fire because the tinder was dry and ready to go. it was an obvious own-goal on trudeau's part, hence why it took off.

no one other than a few facebook comment sections would have given half a shit if he had made a token appearance or two, and then went on vacation the next day.

empty houses, even if it were an endemic level of them, are not an indication that folks are buying houses because interest is low and keeping them empty.

low interest rates simply do not follow your argument.

again, it’s much more complex than just one variable in an equation like interest rates. i also don’t buy the argument that it’s simply a supply issue.

i would contend that in a lot of places in canada, our property has been undervalued for too long, and it’s only just catching up to reality now. i’m not talking about the gta and vancouver here, but neither is anyone else anymore.

we can reduce demand by increasing interest rates. we can reduce demand by decreasing immigration. we can reduce demand by preventing investment firms from buying property as investments. all of these break the supply problem. we can increase supply to meet demand.

politics is downstream from culture and media. which means that you can't change the culture through politics. politics is a reflection. the media and entertainment industries say \"xxx\" is good or bad, and people vote based on that (or wherever they get their culture from). 

so it is idiotic to attempt to 'fight' a culture war that we can't win on the political stage. the better choice is to fight on grounds we can win on and while we are there restore rights and remove restrictions placed on us by the left and seek to weaken their strangleholds on institutions. not get into fights about abortion and gays downstream of that.

doesn't mean you can't do things that side likes. like giving funding to adoption options. but that's not the same as pandering to the socialist conservatives which is a dead end. 

so with that in mind, is jean a qualified leader who can address the economic issues while still rebuilding the right of center brand and bringing people to the table? 

he'll probably do all right. i don't think he's the perfect example of what alberta needs right now. but -  think he would be better than kenney and a lot better than the ndp :)  and i haven't seen anyone better putting their name forward at this point. so i think he'd fall into the \"good enough\"  category.",conservatives

&gt; rural folks don;t use hand guns though. they use long guns for hunting. hand guns are for killing people, not deer.

fun little fact check: the only reason nobody takes rabbits with 22 handguns is because the practice was banned in the 1990s — to zero public safety benefit.

&gt; the fact that there are straw purchases contributing to the proliferation of guns is why i want their sale banned.

this sounds like an argument that'd serve *just* as easily to promote municipal *long*-gun bans in an election cycle or two. i'm curious: does *any* non-zero number of straw purchases merit a ban, and what limiting principle prevents this callow standard from being next applied to the owners of long guns that haven't yet been banned?

surely i'm misunderstanding, and my hunting guns won't be affec—

&gt; why risk guys like alexandre bissonette, kimveer gill , and marc lepine (all mass shooters, legal gun owners who joined gun clubs as part of their training to gun down their targets) taking home their guns to commit heinous criminal acts.

ah, and there it is. three names, two of whom used long guns. most proponents of handgun bans pretend like they wouldn't go after rifles and shotguns next. if nothing else, this is at least a refreshing dose of honesty. looks like once my targetry hanguns are gone, it'll next be range storage for long guns if you had your way.

so, *again*, for any hunters reading this. if you're telling yourself this new proposal isn't too bad because it isn't currently throwing *you* under the bus, remember that the people being pandered to by policy proposals like this will happily push to go after more of your hunting guns next.

the board of internal economy was never given the authority to exclude mps from the house.  that power can only be exercised by the house of commons.  it has always been the case that someone who prevents an elected member of parliament from attending parliament is violating parliamentary privilege.  so from that logic, this vaccine mandate seems to be a violation of parliamentary privilege.

if a vaccine mandate among parliamentarians is truly a good idea, the house should have voted on that this week.  instead, a small committee of only a handful mps made the decision a few weeks ago on behalf of all the other mps.

whether or not the speaker will rule this as prima facie, is an entirely different question since he was part of making that decision. but i think it's clear that the board had no authority to do such a thing.

one thing that gives me a lot of comfort here is that the pfizer facility in puurs, belgium is shut down in order to retool, so as to increase their daily production rate.  prior to this shut down pfizer was projecting 1.3 billion doses from the puurs facility in 2021.  as a result of this retooling work they are projecting 2.0 billion doses from the puurs facility in 2021.

it is certainly possible that canada will not be able to get even a single one of those 700 million extra doses, and it is even possible that, for 'reasons', canada will actually be in worse shape as far as our deliveries go.

welfare is money designated for living expenses. cash settlements are not. one is more fundamentally important than the other and a basic human right, and you can't even remotely compare the two. gst is another argument, but a pretty weak one. it's already in the budget and has nothing to do with social justice.

i'm not gonna get into the bio weapon / lab leak conspiracies, but it isn't a stretch to say that beijing has often demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice a few lives \"for the greater good\". if something is serious enough for even them to grind to a halt, you better take that shit seriously. this is a sentiment found on both the anti-beijing and the pro-beijing sides.

lack of or crappy climate change plan.  this is a non starter for me and most people i know. i voted cpc this year because i am tired of the left wing pandering and lockdown culture but i still had a hard time because if this. 

then there is my wife (who also has a problem with cpc climate change stance) but also constantly goes back to abortion issues and the fact that there are a large amount of conservatives who still don’t support it and there is always that unanswered question on whether they will try to bring up the issue again. she will never vote cpc as long as this issue remains on the table.

if you import identity politics, sure you get scared voters that love your useless ban on guns (side note: it wouldn't have prevented a single shooting, and never will, because, shocker, criminals tend to kill people with already illegal guns, and the us has basically an infinite supply of those, who'd have thought!). you get to pass laws to solve pretend problem that are popular with us twitter, but you're also importing qanon and that stuff, even if that's not your intention.

1 - obviously despite the wording this is about whether or not equalization is 'fair' and should be something we do, and if we do it what would it look like to be actually fair?  we're never going to hold power just saying that it should be scrapped entirely always. too many provinces actually use it to get past the 7/50 rule. 

2 - was this a good choice for kenny to do or is it just a right wing version of virtue-signalling that stirs up anger?

in terms of “individual freedoms vs common good,” i don’t know that the line is always so well defined. it’s a really interesting question as to which ‘side’ embodies it more. for example, my feeling is that there are certain fiscal issues where the ‘conservative opinion’ is more sold as a common good stance. i must not be great with the nuance of the issues either, because the argument for body autonomy vs. state-mandated healthcare totally switches sides when it comes to abortion, for instance.
