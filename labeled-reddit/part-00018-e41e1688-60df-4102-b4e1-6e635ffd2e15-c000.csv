*  uneven treatment of male and female ministers turns back the clock on women's struggle for equality.
* during the 2018 general election campaign, liberals christine st-pierre and marwah rizqy questioned legault’s real beliefs about equality of the sexes. as if to prove them right, legault blew a gasket. 
* danielle mccann, arguably the most qualified person to have ever been named health minister in quebec, had just finished shepherding the province through the first wave of the pandemic when she, too, was sacked by legault. dr. horacio arruda, whose track record was spotty at best, had no trouble holding onto his job. 
* when the tragic death of joyce echaquan in a joliette hospital made the headlines, indigenous affairs minister sylvie d’amours was promptly shown the door. no second chance there.
* last week, photos were published of legault and economic development minister pierre fitzgibbon in paris in 2019 with the head of an investment fund headquartered in a tax haven. fitzgibbon owns shares in the fund that he’s still refusing to sell despite successive rulings of the ethics commissioner. both fitzgibbon and legault have thumbed their noses at ethics commissioner ariane mignolet. after all, what do girls know about big business dealings? and … boys will be boys!
* legault’s record of forgiving incompetence or ethical lapses in his male cabinet ministers, while lowering the boom on women even for the slightest perceived shortcoming, is becoming a defining element of his administration.
* we have been soft-shoeing our way into a new duplessisme for the better part of three years. this gloaming to la grande noirceur 2.0 turns back the clock on women’s struggle for equality.

i used to think that mulcair's bridges to the quebec liberal party were burned over his resignation as environment minister on principle when the charest government cynically turned a provincial park over to condo developers. this piece makes it sound like he's ready to take on legault the way he took on harper. ideologically, mulcair is a liberal which makes him a bad fit for the ndp/quebec soilidaire. his tolerance for graft and grifters  is more ndp/qubec solidaire, though. it makes him  a bit of a political orphan, though, being a liberal with a sense of ethics.",liberals

gty2xi8,2021-04-09T02:25:49.000-07:00,"discussion thread - 2021 liberal party of canada convention i think the most interesting policy discussion is going to be on universal basic income. there's actually two resolutions: one fast-tracked and a second one which is prioritized (part of the \"health, justice and social development\" workshop). there's a lot of enthusiasm for ubi (including in the liberal caucus), so my guess is that at least one will pass.

if i get a chance, my 45-second question will be something like this:

there's a lot of enthusiasm for basic income, but i'd like to ask advocates if you've been watching recent warning signs about whether it's a good idea or not.

first, the ndp government in bc, which is very progressive, set up an expert panel to do a [two-year study of basic income](https://bcbasicincomepanel.ca/). they concluded that it was costly and ineffective. they recommended more specific improvements to the existing system, rather than the kind of massive, sweeping changes that come with basic income.

second, the pbo just released [a similar assessment](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/en/blog/news/rp-2122-001-s--distributional-fiscal-analysis-national-guaranteed-basic-income--analyse-financiere-distributive-un-revenu-base-garanti-echelle-nationale), concluding that while basic income would cut poverty rates by half, the annual cost would be huge: close to 90 billion annually. to give some scale, in comparison to the net cost of the canada child benefit reform, which cut child poverty by a third, basic income would be more than 20 times as expensive.",liberals

but this point is ignoring that both ford and kenney simply are not deploying the vaccine they have at their current disposal, nor are they using the money and other federal resources given them to combat this. so basically, trudeau has done his job and continues to navigate the hiccups. deployment is provincial. full stop.

the federal government has not been perfect in their response. critics seem to forget that many of those failures come from a neoliberal point of view on science and public health. the need to preserve the economy was and is a huge factor in the response, and it shouldn't be. people are the economy and money isn't more important than lives.

forgive me but until you actually provide a definition for left wing, i will continue to ask rhetorical questions. of course i can speculate that by left wing you mean \"anyone nixon would have hated\" (hippies, students, labor activists, libertarians, sympathisants, academics, etc.) so please, surprise me and say otherwise.

also liberalism is centered on pursuit of free markets. so for all the railing about duh liberals, na conservative voters unwittingly support a version of liberalism lol. the distinguishing feature is the religious authoritarianism (og cancel culture fyi)

&gt;you dont need to be a communist or socialist to qualify as left wing.

you haven't really meaningfully replied to points - such as the fact that other liberal democracies actively defend themselves without actually debasing their democracy. germany has 7 parties in the bundestag and dozens more on the ballot. elections canada is an incredibly competent (not hopelessly conflicted) independent organization. there's no reason to suspect we can't do it again. so, with respect, i don't how you can rely on your argument that since bernier didn't do well last time there isn't a problem argument while ignoring the fact that these measures actively work elsewhere (unless of course you're voting for bernier).

this also goes beyond hitler. orban won his election fair and square. so did pis in poland. yet, the citizens in those countries now cannot change their government. are those parties committing genocide? no. however, being able to elect an opposition is meaningfully important to the process of having and keeping a liberal democracy. orban, pis, le pen are absolutely direct comparisons.",conservatives

there's no denying that hydro energy can be destructive especially as the plants become larger, but it is slightly funny to me that we're arguing against hydro power when bc is largely powered by it. we've been wrecking the environment for this hydro power for decades and now i take it that people want us to pivot to wind and solar (nuclear is a non-option in bc). 

i look outside and the problem is solar will be non-optimal in the lower mainland and i would assume the rest of bc. there's too much cloud coverage throughout the year and that lowers the efficiency of solar.

i won't commentate on wind because i'm not as familiar with how the wind currents on say off the coast of bc. but we need more energy despite our increasing efficiency on utilizing energy in the residential sector. there are two things that we need the energy for and one that horgan has recently pointed out, which i've been saying for years.

the first is an increasing demand for electric cars. horgan has pointed this out and i am in agreement that we will need to have the capacity to recharge more electric vehicles in the future, which ice vehicles do not have this problem. 

the second is vancouver has already intended to ban fossil fuel for all low rise buildings. i'm not sure if it's possible for higher density buildings, but i don't see any inclination why vancouver and the lower mainland may not pivot in that direction later. this would mean higher energy demands in place of natural gas heating for water and heat.

i'm sure there's more optimal ways of getting energy that's less controversial (wind probably) but the sunk cost fallacy is real so we're now ploughing through it. doubled the project cost estimates be damned, much to my annoyance.",liberals

i agree that the rise of anti-asian sentiment is a concern and that china is now ( and will likely in the future ) a major trading partner.  like the usa, we are in an inquitable trade relationship with china and our refuge to that is our adherence to our laws regardles of who is effected.  

we aren't entirely toothless with either trading partner.  when faced with economic attacks we tend to hit back proportionally and that seems to be effective.

our policy is fairly universal as it relates to ethics and morals and international diplomacy - advocate for our moral position and adhere to our agreed contracts ( legislation, regulation and commercial contracts ) regardless of how the other party behaves.  our courts can be trusted to apply our law fairly and without regard to political or commercial pressure.

extradition is the outcome the americans want, halting is the option the chinese want. aside from generally preferring the americans to the chinese, halting the extradition requires active intervention my the minister of justice while allowing the extradition to go through just requires us to wait for the courts to go through the process. 

it is in the best interest of canada to let two innocent canadians die in arbitrary detention. its ugly, it's cold, but thems the brakes.",liberals

québec wants more autonomy and provincial powers. québec wants more ability to promote and protect the french language. québec wants the ability to pick their own immigrants. québec wants to protect it's own values as it pertains to stuff like secularization, etc, etc. you can swap a lot of social conservatism with more of a cultural conservatism in québec. 

the tories need to keep running on this contract with quebeckers, no matter whether they win or lose this election. 

also -- there are a lot of québécois conservatives who genuinely want the rest of what the cpc wants as well. 

it sounds funny, but quebeckers just need to see the tories as allies again, which i honestly think is happening, it just isn't happening overnight.",conservatives

something is going to give - either an ndp crash into the liberals or the much rarer 2011 option. if they sink much lower the left flank might very well abandon the party for the ndp.

i like rosemary barton but this was disappointing interview with lots of \"tough\" questions that were sadly not terribly interesting but rather pretty typical lazy, and biased gotcha questions that people try to get the ndp on all the time. 

barton asked about how singh is going to wrangle jurisdiction, as if there's any actual challenge here, ignoring the fact that the liberals have been working closely with provinces to expand childcare. the reality is that singh's approach will be the same as the liberals.

barton repeatedly brought up all of the spending in the ndp plan, while omitting the revenue side, and unbelievably pushed back when singh tried to note the difference between his plan and that of the other parties, the revenue side, shutting him down as if he didn't have a real actual point to make.

anyway, chrétien won the leadership but martin's attacks during the race left some personal friction and contributed to chrétien being perceived as unpopular in quebec. additionally, after the results martin basically told a cbc reporter that he didn't have confidence in the new leader. both men papered over the frictions, as martin became chrétien's finance minister after 1993, but tensions continued. these started building after the 1997 election where chrétien gained another majority and it was assumed that he would retire before the next election. martin started building support which became public and undermined chrétien a bit in the leadup to a liberal convention. according to chrétien, his wife went on stage at the convention and started a chant of \"four more years\" which was meant to indicate to everyone \"he's not leaving yet.\" which he didn't. he stayed around with his wife's permission for another election and majority win in 2000 which frustrated martin's plans.

after 2000 martin wanted the top job so he started planning. this period is a bit muddled for me but the personal tensions boiled over and martin resigned as finance minister which gave him freedom to campaign against chrétien. basically he got a bunch of eda presidents on his side and gave chrétien an ultimatum of step down or lose a leadership review at the next convention. chrétien announced his resignation to take effect in 2004 after a leadership vote in late 2003. 

martin won the leadership easily and pressured chrétien to step down as pm earlier than intended, which occurred in december of 2003 i believe instead of the original timeline. this coincided with the sponsorship scandal exploding just as martin became pm which really hurt him. martin records in his memoirs that he was furious as chrétien for leaving him with this ticking time bomb.

there's probably more to it, but those are the major points that i can recall. needless to say neither man was very happy with the other. if you want the full story brooke jeffrey's \"divided loyalties\" is a good retelling of why the schism happened and how it continued to plague the liberal party pretty much until their disaster in 2011.",liberals

but the glue keeping calgary in the tory coalition has been completely eroded, and theres a growing admission that the emperor has no clothes. there was an unwritten understanding between calgary voters and the conservatives that calgary would deliver them government if they managed the economy well and spent handsomely in the city. the ucp have delivered on neither.

\"but if they have legitimate reasons, why not use a regular port of entry?\" due to the safe third party agreement, if a refugee applicant shows up at a regular us-canada crossing and tries to apply for asylum status they will be told to get fucked and turn around, regardless of the merits of their case. this is because the united states qualifies as a \"safe third party\" but given the past 5 years of american history i do not blame asylum seekers for not exactly feeling safe there. 

but okay, let's assume some of them are ne'er-do-wells trying to sneak their way into canada: at that point crossing at a place like roxham road is the dumbest way you could go about it. the key to successfully immigrating illegally to anywhere is to avoid all possible contacts with the government, *especially* law enforcement.  the rcmp are standing literally on the other side of roxham road so if you're not legit than the clock is ticking from the word go. the sensible thing to do (and how the vast majority of illegal immigration is done) is to just overstay your visa. come in for a \"vacation\" and just never leave. 

the irregular border crossings are being used to circumvent the stpa because that's the only way they would be able to apply for asylum. anyone trying to dodge the system is just going to come in on a plane.

hcy7igd,2021-09-14T23:49:37.000-07:00,"time to ditch first-past-the-post electoral system you are conflating proportional representation with representation by population.  representation by population is when a set population defined by geography has a representative.   that's what we have.  we don't have proportional representation and canada never should have that in both chambers - why - because to win all one has to do is gear policy to please the 5-6 biggest cities in canada - to the detriment of every other district.   canada, with its population dispersal, is not suited for proportional representation.   the ndp fails to have electable candidates with policies to please enough districts compared to the bloc that has policies that please more districts so yes the bloc will win more seats.   sure i support the ndp, but they have no business being given representation of districts they came in second, third or forth.   and you are comparing a regional party, which canada has a history of having many, to a national party.  research and see that the very first national election in canada had an regional separatist party in atlantic canada - the anti-confederation party.  and they won seats - deservedly so.   comparing regional party outcomes to national party outcomes misses the point of the house of commons altogether.   and just look at all the elections that happened in canada - so many parties have come and gone - the only constant has been the liberal party (the party of the rich elite that have entrenched media power and influence).   the number of parties coming and going is a very good thing - its very healthy - the liberal party is not part of that healthy democratic process.

and as i initially mentioned whether is a plurality in a district/riding or a manufactured majority through some scheme of rank ballots or instant runoff it matters so little - any change from plurality has been shown to impact less than 10% of districts - so in the end its an added complication with added expense for not much difference.   and whether one prefers a plurality to manufactured majority is just an esoteric philosophical question that matters little - one is not better than the other - it comes down to just preference - and in the end doesn't increase or decrease representation.   so implement the cheapest option in my opinion, but if you want the more expense and complicated ranked system or instant runoffs i honestly don't care that much.  i don't care because its been proven not make so little difference.  but why waste money.  i'd rather it spent on health care and education.

proportional representation makes sense in a population that is more uniformly distributed around a country and often is better in smaller countries where industry is also more evenly distributed.  in canada industry is urban, suburban and also very rural; and arguably the most important industries are the most rural: agriculture, resource extraction, power generation.   which is to suggest that the rural vote is extremely important and should not be drowned out by the urban and suburban vote.

proportional representation would make sense in the senate where there already are multi-member seats.  i.e if each province has 10 seats, those seats aren't tied to the specific regions within the province and could be assigned based on the proportional voting pattern of the province.  so if a greens get 10% of the vote in a province they get 1 of the ten senate seats for that province even though they may not have fielded a single candidate that won a riding seat in the other chamber.   this is the balance that is missing, our real democratic deficit.  instead provinces have different numbers of seats in our second chamber and they aren't based on the votes of the populace, and instead the whim of a pm that was only voted in in a single district - who literally got at most 150,000 votes (i didn't google the the formula but there is a maximum pop for a riding that is something like that, as there is also a minimum).

i deal in the real world, not your made up world.  what the house of commons is clearly defined.  and our broken senate is clearly defined.  they both function as designed and its the senate that was designed poorly, designed 150+ years ago when appointments were normal, and inherited practice from the uk.   we need to fix the design flaw that the senate is.   the house of commons is not in need of fixing, and would mean so much more if the senate was addressed.

by the way, a bicameral system is what is promoted by the un as the preferred democratic model - two chambers, one regional chamber balanced by a rep by pop chamber, both elected.",liberals

more info:

\"carbon tax in canada has two main parts. the first is a carbon levy imposed on fuel purchases, while the second is a big emitter's program designed for industrial facilities. according to the government of canada, the carbon tax will be adopted by all provinces that have none in place. the tax is considered revenue neutral because proceeds will go back to the residents of the provinces in the form of climate action incentive (cai) rebates. residents of some provinces, including saskatchewan, ontario, alberta and manitoba, are eligible for cai rebates, which you can claim on line 45110 of your annual tax return.  
  
the federal government created cai to ensure taxpayers are receiving end of proceeds from the carbon tax, as they are likely hit most by soaring power bills and fuel prices. cai rebates go to taxpayers as refunds and can be as low as $430 in 2020 to as high as $1400 by 2022. however, the payments you receive will depend on various factors, including the province you live in and household size. part of the carbon tax revenue will also go to schools, universities, nonprofits, indigenous communities, municipalities smbs. payments will automatically offset the balanced (tax) owed to the cra or added to your eligible refunds.\"

he had interesting things to say about the increase of political interests in political parties and how over time they've became narrower ideologically rather than the broad tents they used to be. how regionalization has become entrenched. he expressed hope that o'toole may help change the dynamic inside the cpc, but that he had a long road ahead of him. 

and as the title here suggests, clark also commented that the current liberal government is image-oriented to the detriment of significant action-taking. he said that in his experience as foreign minister, canada was at its worst when it preached to the world rather than acted. 

finally, though he remained diplomatic enough, he called out jason kenney for having a \"us vs them\" mentality in his governance. spoke more broadly about how people make untrue and unflattering caricatures about alberta, rural alberta especially and about how canadians don't really know one another.

&gt;  
&gt;the prime minister says no, not now, while we’re still in the midst of the crisis; there’ll be time for that later.

good on the toronto star to address this issue and do so which only a touch of political slant.  the unfortunate circumstances canadians find themselves, holding their breath waiting for a vaccine, is very much due to political slant creating divisions.  instead of politicians attempting to find ways to implement hard to achieve scientific-based decisions, there is no public resistance when public health policies are catered to political will.

through it all, there's been as much unscientific review by our canadian press when politicians start providing epidemiological updates and pressers. 

the thing is, [ottawa had a playbook for a coronavirus-like pandemic 14 years ago.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ottawa-had-a-playbook-for-a-coronavirus-like-pandemic-14-years-ago/)

ottawa even used that pandemic playbook in 2009 to save canada from the h1n1 pandemic [that ravaged the rest of the planet except canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic)

do you remember getting locked down in 2009?  hellz no!

[this time, ottawa ignored all the scientific advisors with pandemic experience and muzzled the department saying we needed to roll out the pandemic playbook](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-what-happened-with-canadas-pandemic-alert-system-the-gphin/).

i'm always seeing the pseudo-epidemiologist suggestions and my concern isn't that everyone and their dog thinks they know better - it's that canadian politicians at all levels have undermined public health policies with political agendas which naturally caused the general public to lack faith in public health officials.

instead of the tried and trusted pandemic playbook, prime minister justin trudeau chose to adopt a \"swiss-cheese\" pandemic strategy where gamification is used to allow infection but played out so it doesn't overwhelm the morgues.  canadians are often confused because politicians at the provincial and municipal levels are often pointing a finger at the community for spreading the virus, but the strategy has never been to contain the virus.  and the danger of keeping schools open has never been that children will die.

canada's current strategy is to constantly change public health policy based on how many people give a rats ass about death in the ltcs while the rest of us hold our breath waiting for a vaccine.  the thing is, \"flattening the curve\" actually made sense back in march of 2020 because trudeau was convinced nrc and cansino were going to provide a vaccine before september 2020.

keep in mind canada was legally obligated under international health regulations we proposed to declare a national pandemic response when the who declared covid-19 to be a pandemic of international concern on january 30th.  this doesn't mean declaring a national emergency (canada is one of few countries to never declare a national emergency) it meant activating the federal department of public safety and having a canadian representative coordinate with the [who's pandemic preparedness playbook.](https://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic/en/)

i've seen stories about phac being understaffed to provide a pandemic response and that's partially true, except for the fact that all of public safety are sitting on their hands.

this wasn't trudeau's first time not abiding by our ihr legal obligations.

why trudeau didn't reconsider using the pandemic playbook on may 13th when the cabinet learned of the failure of cansino and chose to lie about it for 3 months is more likely what caused a rift between morneau and trudeau.

exactly what happened with cansino is being blocked from this document data dump based on \"national security\".

at some point, canada will do more than a \"document dump\".  there will be an inquiry and hopefully, the inquiry is provided with the ability to find blame and lay charges - because there is no accountability for politicians who are ignoring expert advice in favour of pandering to the political will of the people.

there is hope for tomorrow . . . there is every reason trudeau could declare a national response and crack open canada's pandemic playbook tomorrow; new variants, vaccine hold-ups, no vaccine for kids, 21,300 dead canadians.

our only hope may rest on the opposition . . . and it is a minority government  . . . there's a lot that can be achieved during minority rule and this document dump is one of them.",liberals
