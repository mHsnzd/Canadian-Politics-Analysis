\"but the federal government has itself been accused of resisting efforts to publish records related to the residential school system and the atrocities that took place within the schools.
as recently as 2020, ottawa won an ontario superior court case that blocked the creation of statistical reports on residential school abuse claims and the direct transfer of other records to the national centre for truth and reconciliation.
the supreme court of canada also ruled in 2017 that thousands of records documenting abuse at residential schools should be destroyed.\"",liberals

and that's the reason for the difference, right there.

trudeau chose to be a liberal; he chose to become a politician; he chose to make certain policy promises; the promises he kept, he chose to keep; the promises he broke, he chose to break. where he's hated, he's hated because of his choices.

fakih, on the other hand, is hated because he was raised as a muslim, something that he had no choice in; certainly, he could choose apostasy, but if he truly believed what he was brought up to believe, that's no choice at all.

i'm not big on hating people in general; when undeserved, it's unacceptable, and when deserved (to what extent it can be), it almost seems to be rewarding them for their provocative behavior. that said, i can totally grasp why some people hate the police, or anti-vaxxers, or oil companies, because not only have these groups done tangible harm to people in the past, but a lot of them are still continuing to, and the ones who aren't doing that harm often enable the ones who are.

it's not fair to tell people they can't hate; it's an emotional reaction to a perceived threat to themselves and/or their loved ones, and there's no way of getting rid of that; i don't know if we'd want to even if we could. and saying that they can't express that hatred isn't fair either.

but when the threat doesn't actually exist, when it's only perceived because a person belongs to a group that they didn't choose for themselves (race, gender, sexuality, religion, country of origin, etc.) rather than for an action that they did choose (e.g. liberal politician), that's when we need to step in early and head things off. because you can assign security to protect justin trudeau, or even every federal, provincial, and municipal politician, but you can't assign enough people to protect every member of every marginalized group that someone might hate, and, when you look at even recent massacres, it's clear that you'd have to protect all of them, because any of them could be the target.",liberals

the largest issue we've had with electric infrastructure is governments taking too large dividends from crown corps, which has eaten into their maintenance and upgrade budgets. 

***edit*** i should add too that governments have used low power rated as part of their industrial policy to subsidise industry and to some extent rate payers, starving the power corps. bob ray and mike harris tried to fix that to some extent, but rates shot up, rate payers complained and rates ended up frozen again. there remains an infrastructure deficit in ontario in particular. things did not improve under mcguinty/wynn

the simple fact is, much like the afd today, the nazis had more power in their early days due to the pr system. that makes pr system more favourable to the fringe elements. which means its less stable for society. which means its a worse system. these are fairly obvious extrapolations of the basic fact that nazis in their first few elections would've had lesser seats under a hybrid model or a fptp model.

a system that gives the nazis and afd more seats is giving them more seats than a system that does not. that is just basic facts. under fptp, afd would have 5% of the seats. thanks to pr, they have 11.5% of total seats.

this is of course all assuming that doug is a good faith actor, which given his track record is highly dubious. he was parachuted in to the leadership position after patrick brown was shivved by his own party, and from there has cozied up with the harris ilk. look at how he has protected the ltc industry (an industry full of conservative party beneficiaries) from public scrutiny after it was shown to be a disaster in handling the basic needs of its vulnerable residents. it's dangerously naive to assume that these are simply the actions of someone who is unable to empathize with those impacted (which again, when we're talking about the leader of a province it's kind of insane to brush this trait off), and rather is someone who is trying to cover for wealthy cronies.

(mmt haters  most often don't engage with the latter part of the theory.)

is it realistic to expect governments to enact taxes to control inflation? taxes come with their own political economies and while i have my issues with monetary policy i don't think people think of interest rates as a politcal tool like they do taxes.  for instance, if the central bank wanted to put a lid on housing prices they could increase rates back to 4-5% and i don't think people would really fault the government for it. (they would blame the government for the recession but not the interest rates even though the two are related).

with taxes if the government wanted to remove the principal residence exemption to control housing inflation that would be very unpopular (in fact the lpc policy convention voted against it) so i'm not sure the government and taxation is a reliable way to control inflation. or at least that seems like an obvious critique of the theory.  


plus the feds had to make deep cuts in the 90s to essentially delever the country because interest payments took up a huge portion of the government budget. so given our history, it seems like a pretty big leap of faith to suggest that the central bank can buy all the bonds and finance government spending indefinatly.",conservatives

 out of lockdown fully-vaccinated and ready to invest in the future.

yes - about 5 days before the election starts :)  that would be about perfect for him. and that's obviously what he's shooting for. 

his popularity was nosediving before the pandemic. let me remind you the cpc actually got more votes than the liberals did last election. he enjoyed a major boost in popularity during the first year of the pandemic, when he was on tv every day and nobody else was. 

now he's used it to excuse a budget nobody in the country would endorse during normal times. lots of goodies, lots of rewards, and lots of buying votes.

h2p39uh,2021-06-22T07:15:35.000-07:00,"np view: green infighting exposes justin trudeau's hypocrisy on israel &gt;that's not it. it's the level of manufactured importance of this random guy, along with the manufactured story of atwin getting up in arms over it enough to bolt, when she dropped it immediately after becoming a lib, who's take on the matter mirrored paul's take.

the random guy was the party leader's media spokesperson. here's his post, if you need a refresher, in which he vowed to work to unseat atwin and manly.

https://canadiandimension.com/images/made/images/articles/_resized/noah_natzman_post_fb_680_288_90.jpeg

now, for whatever reason, you still don't seem to grasp that the claim isn't that atwin left over the party's stance or the leader's stance on israel/palestine, but over the direct threat to unseat her and the leader's refusal to appropriately address this. now if it was only jenica atwin telling this story, that would be one thing, but it's also may and manly and members of the party council and other prominent greens like david coon, while paul seems to have virtually *no* support here (seriously, has any prominent green stood up to say that these people are lying? has any prominent green stood up in support of paul?). it's literally paul's word against everyone else's and you're accepting her story and her cries of racism and sexism that are, frankly, pathetic. additionally a draft of an internal letter from senior party officials was leaked, in which it is alleged that at a caucus meeting, atwin told paul that she had been trying to reach out to her for a week, and paul flatly told atwin that she had received the messages but chose to ignore them. is this the meeting that you're claiming didn't happen? paul hasn't even claimed that.

&gt;the ridiculousness of atwin's about-face behaviour is of course something that could not be entirely controlled during this transition, and we've seen nothing but fairy tale generation ever since. my guy.

i agree it was ridiculous. i've made it more than clear that i think atwin betrayed her party to join a government far more supportive of israel than she claimed to be comfortable with. it's pure careerism. we agree that atwin is a hypocrite, at best, on this question. that doesn't mean that paul handled the situation at all appropriately. again, if it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty grand conspiracy that includes elizabeth may, whose support was key to paul winning the leadership in the first place.

i will also say that paul doesn't have a seat in the commons and, realistically, isn't going to win toronto centre where she's running. she needs to treat her elected mps like gold, and if they all tell her she's in the wrong, she needs to stand by them. this would be true if the greens were a major party, but it's arguably even more true for a party in the position they're in.

edit: here's my read on the real situation with paul's leadership: she came in with a pretty narrow mandate as the anti-left candidate with elizabeth may's seal of approval, and thought that she would be taking control of the machinery of the party. other people in the fairly anarchic party, many of whom had long chafed under may's leadership and were anxious to return to a far more internally democratic way of doing things, pushed back and let her know pretty early on that she wasn't going to get to have everything her way - even may couldn't do that, and the greens were never going to let paul have the same kind of authority that may had (paul has publicly complained about this), because the party is supposed to be decentralized but they would follow may almost anywhere because she was almost synonymous with the party brand. she had, and probably still has, power and authority in the party that transcends the formal responsibilities of the leadership role. additionally paul received a fair bit of pushback against some of her initiatives. she has interpreted this as racism and sexism - because she's not getting the respect she feels entitled to. now, fair enough, maybe she isn't, but at that point it doesn't matter - if you don't have the respect of the people you're trying to lead, you can't lead, end of story. additionally the hard left faction which opposed her leadership to begin with have pounced on any weakness at every turn because they want her removed. they are the drive behind the federal council's initiative to have her leadership reviewed. but they aren't alone. now, again, you can see this as a plot, and that would be a fair enough assessment, but it still shows that paul isn't capable of holding this party together.",liberals

i think you're largely right, and over time, i've realized that a lot of political issues can be driven by a sense of being respected/disrespected.  

one example is civil unions for gay couples vs gay marriage.  conservatives in various countries offered to allow civil unions, which would give gay couples all of the same legal rights as married couples, but under a separate label.  however my understanding is that the gay community saw that as marking them (or their relationships) as lesser, even if substantively it would be equivalent.  they didn't just want the same legal rights, they wanted to be fully included in the institution of marriage, as a demonstration that they're truly viewed as equals.  essentially, it was about respect.

in this case of alberta and equalization, i could be wrong but i think the disrespect is probably less about people shitting on alberta online, and more about frustrations with stalled oil pipelines, and hearing environmentalists (and others) talk about the oil industry like it's a problem to be solved, rather than an important part of canada's economy. it creates a sense that alberta's economic contributions to the country (which have been huge) are being disregarded, rather than appreciated.",conservatives

because i live in a lower class area and nobody here drives a vehicle that is electric. they’re practically all used cars that are older. there’s also no demand from any other tenants to get chargers. 

now, i’m saying this as someone who fully acknowledges and supports an ev future. i’m invested into ev manufacturers, lithium producers and battery manufacturers. i want them to become mainstream, because if they do i end up walking away with some good roi.

there were about 4-5 of them that got caught doing it and they all got suspended without pay for a day. the union reps were just as technologically illiterate as the guy who started it all and had no clue how to fight it and had to eat the punishment.

the funniest part of it all was that i explained to one of them &lt;someone i liked&gt; in confidence that because we worked for a provincial health authority and our managers were \"technically\" public servants we had the right to criticize them online in the same way you'd trash talk justin trudeau or any other public figure in a public space without consequence. he ended up fighting them and regaining the money he lost from the suspension on the grounds that he wouldn't  tell anyone else about it so the others couldn't do the same thing.

the same computer illiterate idiot who got them all caught ended up getting fired a few years later because he wrote some pretty nasty misogynistic almost incel-ish rants on his page. i believe he was around 55-60 at the time.

further, removing senators from his caucus is a *huge* change.  this has freed up senators to begin caucusing around other geographic or political interests (which they've already started doing) rather than lining up on party lines.  and while the senators have stuck to the convention of deferring to the elected house, they have been historically active at amending legislation.

you're seeing the effects of that now. michael wernick (former head of pco) warned of this during the 2019 snc lavelin debacle. he said: 

&gt;i worry about foreign interference in the upcoming election and we’re working hard on that. i worry about the rising tide of incitements to violence, when people use terms like “treason” and “traitor” in open discourse. those are the words that lead to assassination. i’m worried that someone is going to be shot in this country this year during the political campaign.

they're projecting 124 seats for the libs - 147 for the cpc :)   holy crap, shit is getting real. 

like most of the polls, the higher seat count is due to the libs going down rather than the cpc going up, and mainstreet still seems to be showing more cpc support in alberta (hence the higher cpc numbers), which doesn't actually translate into more seats. 

but dayum - if jagmeet can somehow get people excited about an ndp opposition the libs could really collapse here. and if erin gets a second wind in ontario and picks up a few more points - it could really be a cpc majority!  this is just the end of week two!

trudeau has fallen into the prentice trap. prentice called a snap election for the shortest time possible in alberta thinking his opponents weren't ready and he'd have an easy win - but by the time he realized they were doing well he didn't have enough time to turn things around. 

that is what is happening now. trudeau is getting creamed out of the gate - and now he's just got 3 weeks left to 'fix' it and that's just not enough time. 

he might have been able to put up a fight if it was just the cpc doing well, but with the ndp doing stronger than expected he's coming apart trying to fight on 2 fronts.  and there's just no time. 

if he has another bad week this week, he'll go into the debates with negative momentum and people looking for a reason to dislike him and like one of the other two, and he'll face attacks from both sides. it'll be the death of him. and he isn't going to be able to get out of it by talking over people.",liberals

but as a quick (for fun) argumentative rebutal, that concept of preserving culture is normal around the world and does not equate hatred (at least not in my pov). to clarify my point:


 1. most countries outside the \"western world\" would be equated to countried founded on hatred, and suprematic ideas as most are very conservative/protective by our standards (even the \"left wing\" parties) and do much to protect their own culture. is this intrinsically problematic? 


 2. the undrip treaty would not exist if the concept itself of local preservation was wrong as it promotes the conservation of traditonal local cultures. so other than some former colonies such as canada and the us, it  highly promotes the protection of indigenous culture (which can mean the protection of french ethnics in france, britons in the uk). to me i believe the undrip is fine, but if we go by the logic of local cultural/traditional protection is bad then we would be also believe in abolishing this treaty.",conservatives

i respect the comparisons to mccarthyism, but we need to draw a line somewhere as to what is acceptable in our society and what is not. i am not claiming that the opposition's foundation is racism, and i agree that is hyperbolic... but i don't think it's wrong to say that it's the foundation of their base.

if we cannot agree that as a society we cannot tolerate racism and hatred, then we do not have the capability for a functioning society. and not we as you or i, but the collective we. we must have a set of limited shared values and principles, and i think that rejecting racism and hatred in all forms must and is one of them. 

the right wing in canada has failed to live up to it's moral obligations to reject hatred and racism in our society. they silently let it spread in their ranks, and now it's consuming them.

while racism and hatred can be found in all parties, the other groups do a significantly better job at rejecting hatred and racism, which is why it's not spreading to the same extent.

we cannot eradicate hatred, and racism... but we can and must make it the exception, and not the thing we look the other way for as the cpc is, or even worse - the rule.

only if hatred and racism have an approved place in society is the comparison to mccarthyism accurate. i cannot think of another example of something that is more clearly just wrong. (that's not to say that it doesn't exist, just that i can't think of it at this moment.)  hatred being wrong is a simple issue, and trying to complicate it permits hatred to continue. we can have a reasonable debate as to how to reject it, and condemn it for what it is. 

it doesn't matter if people bring up valid points if the only reason they are bringing up the valid points is because of hatred. they should not get to be a voice for that valid point because they discredit that valid point. if someone else with good intentions would like to bring up the same valid point, i think it's worth discussing.",conservatives

things like making it the law for 20% of every board to consist of workers, executive salary caps, stricter acquisition laws/taxes, incentivizing profit-sharing pay structures, mandatory inheritance structures, etc. would all make a difference.

(1840), to refer to the owners of capital. benjamin disraeli used the term in his 1845 work sybil.\\[24\\]the initial use of the term \"capitalism\" in its modern sense is attributed to louis blanc in 1850 (\"what i call 'capitalism' that is to say the appropriation of capital by some to the exclusion of others\") and pierre-joseph proudhon in 1861 (\"economic and social regime in which capital, the source of income, does not generally belong to those who make it work through their labor\").\\[23\\]: 237  karl marx and friedrich engels referred to the \"capitalistic system\"\\[29\\]\\[30\\] and to the \"capitalist mode of production\" in capital (1867).\\[31\\]

i mean, you're batting .500 and that's respectable.

it used to be pretty common to have a 22 pistol when recreating in the woods during small game season. when hunting with handguns was banned, those owners were told that it was okay because *at least you'll still be able to target shoot with them.\" now, the fact that people aren't allowed to hunt with handguns is being used to justify banning them for targetry.

for the other gun owners out there: if you think that this doesn't affect you, remember that this proposal is being driven by strategically-crucial metropolitan areas where voters would happily [ban all guns](https://globalnews.ca/news/6893821/firearms-ban-ipsos-poll-canada/) if they could.

the supply issue is one that is really a provincial one. even if the cmhc wanted to build, they'd need land, money, expertise and contractors and none of that's on the books. imo we need subsidies for new builds with strong controls on pricing to create non market homes to get people who want houses into them, and renters into affordable places. more coops for rent too etc. 

but the money the feds put up still need to sit in the final decision tree of provinces because of how we've structured things. there's zero easy solution and to pretend it's anything but a multi lateral, cooperative, almost generational project is a bit much.
