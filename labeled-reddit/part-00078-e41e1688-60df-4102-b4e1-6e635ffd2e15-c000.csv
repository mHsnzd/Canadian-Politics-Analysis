the hard fact is that britain has always leaned tory, with scotland and the north traditionally being a \"red wall\" for labour, but that red wall has collapsed. but let's be blunt, no political party deserves a permanent existence. labour itself came to the fore with the collapse of the liberal party in the 1920s, so parties do live and die.

if the majority of voters want to perpetually put one party in power, then your beef is with the voters. trying to jury rig elections by creating the modern equivalent of rotten boroughs, just to make elections more \"fair\" is absurd.

the real solution would be to change the voting system entirely to a proportional system, but that's never gained traction in canada or the uk, in part because once a party wins a majority, the last thing on earth it wants to do is cut its own nose off despite its face, and, if the referendums in the uk and in british columbia are indication, electoral reform simply isn't that big an interest to voters.

as to the uk falling part, that is a distinct possibility at this point. i suspect brexit's long term ramifications will be an independent scotland  and the reunification of northern ireland with ireland, leaving the uk about as big as it was under henry viii after he lost calais. but again, that's what the voters chose, even if they had no idea what they were choosing.

there's an old rule, and i have no idea who said it, but it goes something like \"democracy is an important thing in government, but it isn't the only thing.\" australia's elected senate lead to one of the most significant constitutional crises in modern westminster history, in the us it has lead to gridlock. i have absolutely no desire to give the senate the kind of democratic legitimacy that it would gain through election. senate reform to be sure, but if it is to be elected, then there need to be means, like the 1911 and 1949 parliament acts in the uk, which allow, in specific situations, for the house of commons to override any veto by the upper house.",liberals

in the uk, they have the 1911 and 1949 parliament acts which allow the government to invoke measures so that the house of lords cannot veto bills, so at the very least you would need to put in measures such as that to maintain some sort of stability, otherwise you're going to end up with a constitutional crisis at some point. the framers of the bna act did to some extent foresee this possibility, which is why the put section 26 in, to allow a pm to stack the senate (it's only been used once, by the mulroney government to push through the enabling legislation for the gst, which liberals in the senate were blocking). it's either that, or you extend confidence votes to the senate, but that would be unbelievably messy, and could lead to effective minority governments, even where the government holds the majority of commons seats.

frankly, i think an elected upper house is just a bad idea, even if you put in measures that allow the house of commons to override it. giving any legislative assembly democratic legitimacy inevitably means they will be emboldened to use it. even trudeau's minor reform of not appointing senators that caucus with liberal mps has seen a pretty distinct rise of activism in the senate. make those senators elected, and we end up with the kind of gridlock which makes governing in washington so hard.",liberals

of the government mines, only one is close to satisfying safety checklists. many miners are going deeper than 10 meters and drilling horizontal shafts at depth, all without ppe. a lot of the unofficial supply comes from the countryside with zero government oversight or adherence to environmental regulations. the cobalt is turned into cash, which is turned into firearms and drugs to fuel the on-going civil war.

maybe you will realize that your hobby creates risks in other places that will eventually lead to senseless death and violence at the hands lf gun users, illegal or not.

all of your irrelevent attempts to obfuscate the simplicity of my argument with what ifs and the source of the gun and all that other nonsense is directly contradictory to your silly little statement about not being able to face the fear of guns.

your fairly simple attempt to leverage some sort of pseudo-manliness has failed and clearly highlights the irony in accusing someone of being afraid of guns when they themselves cant admit to a very simple and very straightforward idea.

h3ikn96,2021-06-29T12:28:59.000-07:00,"green party leader says federal council is no longer asking her to repudiate aide on the climate change thing, it's no longer a minor issue that requires a special party to talk about it. the ndp and the liberals both claim climate action as one of their biggest priorities, if not the biggest, and most voters who care about climate change understand that the green party is not a great vehicle to actually get things done. people who feel that the liberals haven't gone far enough on climate change can choose between the ndp, which can actually win a decent number of seats and have some level of influence in parliament, versus the greens who have a rump caucus and virtually no influence over what happens in parliament.

i mean, the biggest priority for environmentalists today seems to be this \"green new deal\" idea. the ndp is basically the ideal party for this kind of politics, and the liberals are leaning heavily into it too. something like a green new deal requires rapid action from governments on technology, carbon pricing, and infrastructure, and a distant fifth party is a pretty bad option to deliver that kind of promise with any level of credibility.

so i think the green party has been scrambling for what role they can actually play. looking at global green parties, there are a few different ways they can go about it:

1. the \"green tory\". this used to be the green party's original approach to green politics, but i would argue it's an electoral dead end. people with conservative inclinations tend to have different priorities, and are more likely to be deferential to one brand (except for ppc/wexit crazies, who obviously wouldn't vote for an environmentalist party). there are some \"green tories\" for sure but over the past couple decades environmentalism has shifted from a mulroney-esque \"conservation first\" approach to a more left-wing, \"sustainability\" and \"environmental justice\" approach which isn't what a conservative green party would be able to run on.
2. the \"green liberal\". this is favoured by the green party in germany, who are pretty strong on the environment but they're not that left-wing. this was elizabeth may's approach for a long time, but the message of a centrist party with progressive inclinations is far more effectively delivered by the liberals. green liberalism works in germany because there is no ideological equivalent to the liberal party there.
3. the \"green ndp/social democrat\". may pivoted more to this approach in 2019, probably because she sensed a weakness in the ndp. based on her leadership platform and heavy focus on things like ubi and social housing, this was annamie paul's vision too. but like i said, green social democrat priorities require a lot of political power to actually implement, and with the ndp bouncing back to 2015-level support (in polling toplines, though not in projected seats because of losing quebec), the ndp has a lot more credibility here.
4. the \"eco-socialist\". this was the direction dimitri lascaris wanted to take the green party, and is common in some european countries like sweden. basically this would mean moving strongly to the left of the ndp, where the green party would take a pretty explicitly leftist/socialist approach to environmentalism, trying to dismantle capitalism along with climate action. unlike the other three i actually think there's more of an opening here ideologically, but i'm not sure if this kind of politics would really resonate with any significant group of canadians outside of politically-active left-wing circles.

so it's not clear what kind of environmentalism the green party can really base itself around. green toryism and eco-socialism may serve the purpose of making conservatism more climate-focused and providing a voice for more radical environmentalism respectively, but it's hard to see how you would expand your political power like that. meanwhile being an environmentalist alternative to the lpc/ndp, the green party's current preferred approach, has more support generally speaking but you'd also be competing for the same vote as much bigger parties.",liberals

he has no idea what he's doing. he's ignored experts. he's lied, cheated and manipulated the system for personal gain for him and his friends.

while ontarians are suffering, he's out changing laws and courting developers to pave over the wetlands.

while ontario's icu numbers are going up and medical professionals are telling him to stop re-opening, he's giving big box stores more leeway, while shutting down small businesses.

he's refused any meaningful lockdowns that would be required with an outright refusal to give subsidies to help small businesses. allowing them to crash and burn while walmarts and lablaws chains stay open and raking in massive profits.

he's outright ignored the medical panel. a couple weeks ago the medical panel was announcing reopening plans, while they at the same time were showing data showing the numbers were going up and a third wave was coming. when asked why are they opening up then? they just shrugged the question off. clearly, doug ford had demanded it.

opc sat on 9+ billion in federally allocated funds during the first year of the pandemic instead of distributing it to businesses and people to keep them going.

he's lied about not having vaccines to give out, when they had in fact only given out a quarter of their supply. all while blaming the feds

the distribution plan is broken (doesn't really exist) where phu's that have no cases are getting as many doses as outbreak regions. there's no targetted deployments. entire regions without outbreaks are ahead in vaccine delivery where areas such as toronto, peel, with the highest outbreaks and the most dense populations are getting trickles. toronto is still on 70+ year olds, while regions like north bay are on the general population (despite no cases)

simply put. doug ford and the opc have been absolutely dangerous, to deadly levels to ontario's population's health. both from covid, mental health and economic.

also, you can see traditional ways of life in xinjiang, with herders and with farmers, etc. there is little if any of such in canada. first nations are relegated on reserves and despite this proposed bill to recognize indigenous rights, no land will be restituted to first nations by the federal or provincial governments.

i dont have to pretend, the matter of fact is that first nations living conditions are pretty much the same as some of the worst developing countries and multiple levels from even middle canadian cities. 

also, unless you want to go quote adrian zenz as a legitimate source, there has yet to be reports of mass deaths in xinjiang. the biggest legitimate concerns with those camps right now are the accusation of forced labour, discriminatory detention, and erosion of religious and cultural freedoms. all of that existed in residential schools if you really wanted to compare, plus mass graves...

i personally consider these trageties to be drastically different despite them both being inexcusable. so if you really want to compare 5 years of illegal detention where  10% of the population got 1 year sentences, or 100 years of systematic stripping of first nations identity, then i got news for you, the argument is gonna be much more difficult to defend in canada's case.

the video was made by b'nai brith supporters after a pro-palestinian rally countered by the jdl (a recognized hate group), at which faith goldy showed up to support the jdl. the video was made in praise of faith goldy and, in it, the b'nai brith supporters stated: “i just think we should bring in the death penalty. and that would resolve a lot of problems… justin trudeau, be the first one to go. i’d love to see him. and monsef. and iqra khalid. and ahmed hussein. and omar alghabra… and singh, singh, let’s make him sing, you know, as he walks toward the guillotine!”

the call on those mps to condemn was not random; they were known for publicly supporting b'nai brith and for being especially biased towards israel. moreover, levitt condemned the pro-palestinian rally at b'nai brith headquarters right after it occurred, but did not condemn the known hate group jdl or the known racist faith goldy. i believe levitt also criticized trudeau earlier for his comments on the shooting of a canadian doctor by an israeli sniper. 

now, lascaris is at a minimum too mouth-frothy for me. i also don't think that israel is currently an apartheid state (although i sincerely think it's trending in either that direction or gradual ethnic cleansing of arabs). and i think he probably has some antisemitic bias. 

in any event, i think the context makes the accusation of overriding loyalty to israel *a lot* less bad than it sounded from what was generally reported. 

think about what your reaction would have been in some analogous sort of situation; e.g. had pierre de bane been an mp when some idiot of arab origin was recorded screaming \"heil hitler!\" at jewish protesters in calgary, was asked to condemn this behaviour, and refused to. suppose also that this idiot was affiliated with groups that pierre de bane publicly and emphatically supported.",liberals

i do know a bit about cleantech.  and the thing is we're at the point where a lot of the switching will happen without any rebates. the bigger issues are infrastructure, regulatory barriers etc.  carbon pricing is basically time shifting at this point forcing those decisions. so, for example, people don't go car shopping without thinking about fuel consumption, as our soccer mom driving suvs and pickup trucks today do.

absent a carbon tax, there's only one actually credible way to do this.  and conservatives aren't going to like it: hard bans.  for example, no more new gas or diesel cars sold and no more gas hookups in new construction beyond 2030.  there are countries taking this approach too (with earlier dates).",conservatives

just to clarify, the people who \"party brass\" normally refers to, the party president, federal council, party elders and so on, would never make this decision; they'd give their input but they're not the ones governing. the pm and his top advisors (who aren't the same people) will be the ones actually making the decision...and, of course, only the pm can advise the governor general to dissolve parliament. but the *party brass* would be the ones begging and pleading trudeau to wait until after the pension deadline.

the bottom line is that it would be bad leadership and bad politics to value the \"incentive\" you're talking about over the chance to reward your party's mps. again, i intend no offense, but this is a half-baked idea that is frightfully ignorant of how politics is actually done. trudeau still needs the loyalty of his caucus, and even if most of them are guaranteed to be re-elected, some of them are not running for re-election, and would be right to feel cheated - \"guaranteed pensions, but you chose to do it this way instead, not because it's right for the country, but to *motivate* us better?\" dude, that's not even how you motivate a team. that's how you get your team to turn on you. this is not even considering that many liberals, even cabinet ministers, were only narrowly elected and could still lose their seats even if the party does well in an election.

if they call an election before the pension deadline it will be because they don't want to wait that long.",liberals

now given some history about abortion in canada let's now talk about my position, i believe in a 20-week and after a ban on abortion. let's talk about how i got there, the easiest peg to put in the ground for when life starts (in my opinion) is to see when the most premature baby was born. this was james elgin gill who was born at 21 weeks and 5 days old. now sprinkle some conservativeness in their and you get my 20-week and after ban.

&amp;#x200b;

now is this position considered to be conservative or liberal? well, we know that there is no federal restrictions on abortion. but lets look at provincial and territorial restrictions:

yukon: 12 weeks

nunavut: 12 weeks

northwest territories: 19 weeks

ontario: 24 weeks

quebec: 23 weeks

pei: 12 weeks

alberta: 24 weeks

saskatchewan: 18 weeks

manitoba: 19 weeks

new brunswick: 16 weeks

nova scotia: 16 weeks

newfoundland: 15 weeks

british columbia: 23 weeks

in conclusion, my abortion position is considered liberal compared to the abortion restrictions of certain provinces and territories (9/13) while more conservative compared to those of the federal government. so i would put my position as centrist or in the middle.

i'm reminded of an article from long ago which i found online. it was from mulroney's time when he was going to triple immigration. he consulted the then economic council of canada - a government think tank, to back him up that this would be a huge benefit for the economy. their answer - no, it wouldn't. it might help a bit, might hurt a bit, depending on the mix of immigrants. they said his decision would have to be made on non-economic factors.

there are many cases where the prosecutor believes it wasn't a natural miscarriage, and, therefore, prosecutes. i could ask you to google, but i did it for you:

[example d, washington state considers prosecution](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/jun/06/criminalizing-miscarriage-why-spokane-police-inves/)

it's not fear-mongering. it's happening. prosecutors are already charging women, and legislators are already writing laws open enough to allow it. it's not yet happening in canada, but the us proves that progress is not linear.

&gt;we have laws where its okay for someone to take a human life - even the life of a legal person.

i disagree; we operate from the premise that taking a life is never 'okay', but there are extenuating circumstances that will allow for a person to avoid prosecution, or allow for prosecution of a lesser crime. when canada eliminated the death penalty, we did away with the premise that there are times when individuals or the state can plan and instigate the death of an individual. 

&gt;i don't know how cheating could not be a moral issue. if your partner was okay with an open relationship - then is isn't cheating. 

ok, so we're coming to semantics here. what we have is an issue of what is acceptable for some and not for others; the law doesn't prosecute adultery as a criminal act, however, it is legal grounds for a divorce in canada. so, in some respect, the law infers that adultery = cheating, instead of a possible agreement between parties that adultery can be acceptable in an open marriage or polyamorous scenario. 

&gt;it's not illegal anymore because as a society we've moved past having the government enforce societal norms in most cases.

i disagree only to specify: we have withdrawn from the private lives of individuals with regard to the criminal policing of sex lives except when consent cannot be / is not given (ie, sexual abuse or rape).

i think we're both of a similar mind here, just quibbling over details. :)",liberals
h6yftwc,2021-07-28T23:55:38.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access well, now this post has fallen off the front page of canadapolitics, so i doubt anyone else is going to see additions to our conversation. i'm happy to keep talking with you if you want though, as long as we remain civil.

i'll start with my opinions on the subject, since you shared yours.

we both agree with abortions for medical reasons, that's a good common ground. we differ on how to handle unwanted pregnancies.

i am firmly pro-choice in this regard. here's why:

1. i will not mandate whether or not a woman can have sex. notably, i will not mandate that women can only have sex for the purpose of becoming pregnant. therefore, it is possible for a woman to enter into an unwanted pregnancy.
2. if a woman does not wish to go through the ordeal of pregnancy, then i do not believe they should be forced to go through with it.
3. given that a woman should not be forced to through with an unwanted pregnancy, i think the most morally correct choice is to allow abortion as soon as possible.

from what i've read in this conversation, you believe all abortions are equally morally wrong (though, i don't see how that world view allows you to give exceptions for abortions for non-consensual situations). you do allow exceptions when the mother's health is at risk, implying you also put value on the mother's life, tipping the moral scales, so to speak. so it sounds like you do accept that a morally wrong act *can be* the morally right choice if it prevents some other, equal or worse morally wrong act (i.e. harming the potential life of a fetus is morally wrong, and harming a pregnant person is morally wrong, yet if you must choose between them, then one of them must be the morally \"right\" choice). in other words, not all morally wrong actions are equal.

you might be surprised to hear that i also think that abortion is morally wrong, for the same reasons you have: a pregnancy represents a human life, and if the only consideration was aborting or not, then aborting cannot be considered morally right. the difference between you and i, i think, is that i do not believe all abortions are morally equal. meaning an early abortion is nowhere near as morally wrong as a later abortion. human life begins at conception, but i have zero qualms about having an abortion moments after an egg is fertilized. this might sound harsh, but it has no organs, no brain activity, no awareness, nothing. it is closer to a woman's period than it is to being a human. therefore, i think the concerns a woman might have with regards to the pregnancy practically always outweigh the moral value of terminating an early pregnancy (concerns such as, do i want to risk my health even if the baby would have ended up perfectly healthy, do i feel like this baby would have a good life if i brought them into the world now, will a 9-month pregnancy negatively affect my life right now, etc.). so, to be clear, i am fully in favor of medical abortions (which occur generally before week 10 in the pregnancy) for what you would might consider trivial reasons.",liberals

this country has gotten far too lax with ensuring proper oversight of the police. we keep acting like the police are some sort of a politically neutral force when the fact is that police officers, like anyone else, are susceptible to political messaging. a lot of people at anti-vaxx protests in canada have witnessed the police giving thumbs up, ok signs (which have been associated with white nationalism in the past), and even hugging people protesting hospitals.

https://leger360.com/surveys/legers-north-american-tracker-august-20-2021/

85% of adult ontarians over 18 are fully or partially vaccinated.  (the appropriate number since we don't poll 12 year olds on their political opinions.)  and 67% support vaccine passports to attend an indoor event like a nightclub.

or in the leger poll, we have age breakdowns!  55+ have 18% opposed outside quebec.  but in ontario, the vaccination rate for those over 60+ is approaching 94%.  approximately 6% unvaccinated and 18% opposed.

what's the unavoidable conclusion?  a sizable proportion of those roughly 1/3rd to 1/5th opposed are vaccinated.  about half, i'm figure, as a ballpark estimate inferred from numbers like those above.

the attack falls a little flat, in part because the character of the socially woke, but economically privileged professional class simply fits the liberal party so much better - no one moreso than their leader. and j.j.'s assertion that the ndp has abandoned material politics for abstractions fits poorly with the actual platform, which is surely the most concretely ambitious in years. demands for pharmaceutical and dental coverage, student debt forgiveness and affordable housing hardly seem 'immaterial'.

the irony of mccullough's complaint is that even as the ndp has re-embraced more material politics, *the right* has become obsessed with social issues, exemplified by writers such as himself. merely scroll through jj's recent articles to find endless culture war takes such as. \"canada’s green party remains a mess of obsessive israel-bashing and allegations of antisemitism\" or \"canada’s history should be debated, not canceled\". but don't worry, we know jj is a very serious economic commentator because he cares about *balanced budgets*. not enough to, you know, write about them in any other context than left-bashing, but what else is there to economics?

democracy means rule by the people, fptp is rule by neighbourhoods and tracts of land, not the people. if millions and millions of voters have the same effect on the outcome of an election as staying home, that's not democracy. if entire ideologies shared by significant swathes of the population are wholly shut out of parliament, that's not democracy. if 38% of the population can overrule the other 62% as long as they live in the right places, that's not democracy. we use aesthetic trappings of democracy like voting to paper over the fact that we are a deeply undemocratic country.",liberals

as an earlier comment in this thread talked about, we have a swath of the population that actively rejects science, but that isn't a new issue nor is it relegated to just one particular party. anti-vax groups have usually included both conservative and liberal identities, occupying far left and far right camps all the same. before covid anti-vax was mostly a fringe ideology of people who didn't trust the government nor modern medicine, and you could find their ranks amongst greens or cpc voters depending on what area of the population you looked at. remember two elections ago the greens had pseudo-science components in their national platform, so it isn't like this is strictly a far-right phenomena. 

the issue with this election is our qspiracy crowds are mostly far-right, and they have attached everything covid related to the libersl government, which is ironic because healthcare is handled at the provincial levels and each province reacted differently to the problem as it unfolded. so by taking influence from the american qspiracy crowds, some canadians are viewing the vaccine rollout as part of this ongoing \"culture war\", and implying that it is one facet of a larger whole where the liberal government is trying to actively shape or force canadians to live a certain way. it's lunacy, but try explaining science to someone who thinks the government is in bed with a global cabal and trying to put 5g wifi into their arms via microchips as a means of making everyone turn lgbtq, or some variation of that.",liberals

you can get semi-auto rifles with larger than 5 round mag limits, 10-20 depending on country, in the us, italy, france, poland, russia, czechia, austria, estonia, finland, south africa, pakistan, and whole bunch of other smaller countries.

the only reason we couldn't use ar-15s to hunt in canada was because they were previously arbitrarily restricted. people did however use literally everything else that was banned to hunt. in terms of sport shooting, it's more than just skeet and trap, things like 3 gun require a semi-auto rifle. fun fact, in the 60s ontario allowed people to hunt and carry handguns while hunting, again it was only arbitrarily stoped.

when i say \"meal team six\", i mean the people that buy guns because they want to form a militia of some sort, not collectors, hunters, sport shooters, or in other countries for self defence. 

if we look to the world capital of meal team six, the us, rifles (of all kinds, bolt, lever, semi-etc) kill less people a [year](https://www.statista.com/statistics/195325/murder-victims-in-the-us-by-weapon-used/) than hands and feet. and this is a country of 20m+ ar-15s, if they were so dangerous you would think they would be the preferred gun of choice by criminals, but they aren't. 

they may look \"scary\" but the reality is that semi-auto rifles are not a problem in any part of the world, even the us. the problems are socio-economic in nature, and more bans on guns won't help fix or even solve any of the root problems. even if the us broke their constitution and banned semi-autos, places like mexico would still suffer. 1 because their problems are socio-economic in nature. 2 because the [majority](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/the-myth-of-90-percent-only-a-small-fraction-of-guns-in-mexico-come-from-u-s) of their guns don't even come from the us.

your first statement, super clear, o'toole never said anything about kenney.

the reply, also clear, he did say something.

then this is really the choice point, right? you can say, \"oh snap, he did say something, i didn't realize that.\" or! you can do the \"move the goalposts\" thing and say, \"well that was a year ago, etc.\"

that's all. i'm absolutely trying to not be partisan or be rude, honestly, but that's a textbook example of moving the goalposts.

for future reference, it's easier to not have to resort to moving goalposts if you just make small tweaks to your declarative statements. like, \"recently he hasn't said anything or...\" \"does anyone know if...\". it keeps you out of these logic traps and stuff. just different ways of phrasing things that make the conversation easier if you happen to be incorrect about something.

the less absolute you are in your statements, the more room there is for correction later without resorting to logical fallacies. it's like \"how to be a politician 101\", haha.",conservatives

it should be apparent that the problem is much more difficult and complex than that. it's not as simple as \"well just don't have children then\", especially when there is a strong biological imperative involved, and despite the somewhat valid point, there is a societal and economic interest involved for people to have children (even in cities that have become unaffordable) and to ensure the children can grow into educated adults.

1. it would demonstrate that the tory's implicit claim that conservative parties at the provincial and federal levels are the natural governing parties of the west is false.
2. it would allow trudeau the opportunity to appoint a \"minister for the west/prairies\", whatever that minister's official portfolio was. in general it has always been seen as critical for any federal government to have at least some representation from every region of the country in cabinet, and not having a cabinet minister from the prairies has been a major hole in trudeau's cabinet.
3. as a representation of national unity, i think it's important, regardless of which party forms government, that that government, whether in cabinet or in the backbenches, be able to actually say they have mps from every region. one of the downsides of trudeau's basically excising an liberal senators from caucus is that the one emergency safety valve that a pm could use of appointing a senator from a specific province or region where the party had little or no representation to cabinet is no longer really feasible, or at least desirable.",liberals

&gt; to me the key reason for banning the ar-15 and equivalents - semi-auto, centrefire, box-fed - is its sheer effectiveness in killing a large number of people in a short time, as demonstrated in mass shootings (and action movies *). mass shootings are rare, but risk = probability x impact.

they are and they are minimally trained (qualification standards and training time provided). law enforcement militarization has already won this race for the le side. they have helicopters, armored vehicles, tear gas and grenade launchers. checkmate for civilian encounters.

but, if inflation is above target (as it is now) that's a sign there are not idle resources to put to work in the economy. in that case deficit spending is harmful not beneficial. it just pulls resources away that were already being put to use. that causes competition for goods and thus inflation. as a result, if you maintain a deficit as inflation is above target you increase the inflation. end result is a terrible spiral, with the government forced to cut spending in order to get inflation under control.

this is just one poll, but it is the first to show gains concentrated in specific places enough that it would lead to ndp gains.",liberals

the tories were in power for almost a decade and made no significant moves to restrict access to abortion. not because they're swell guys, but because they aren't complete imbeciles. 

the cpc leadership understands that the socon view on this issue now falls *way* outside the canadian mainstream. even more importantly from their perspective, abortion has been at the core of the lpc 'secret agenda' narrative for like 20 fucking years. moving to restrict access to abortion would arguably be the greatest gift the tories could ever give the liberals.",liberals

h9kpt1u,2021-08-19T06:11:46.000-07:00,"election reform in canada. constitutional changes are extremely hard to do, so i doubt any of this would change. that said:

1) i support the constitutional monarchy. it's a part of our heritage and it is so embedded into our political and legal system that it would unnecessarily disrupt its organization. whether it be titling legal cases as *r v.* or realizing that the cabinet are *ad*ministrators of the crown (the *prime* minister being the *first* minister of the crown), it all just makes sense and flows. it also allows for a separate institution to remain apolitical and keep the elected government in check, such as by triggering elections. it also keeps us culturally separated from the us.

2) i support senate reform but again, it is super hard to change. i would like to see a completely non-partisan senate equalized to ten senators per province, and two per territory. there can also be a separate senator to represent the government and two more for the assembly of first nations (maybe). i would suggest letting the provincial legislatures nominate them to be appointed by the lieutenant governors. with this model in mind, i believe that the senate should get to approve both the governor general and the supreme court justices as nominated by the pm. however, they should serve on staggered (five appointed every four years) eight year terms instead until they reach 75, and should have a 3 term limit.

3) i understand the desire for electoral reform but the conservatives would never win under that model. there is a reason the ndp wants it extremely bad; in fact, it could give them a chance at governance and it's not worth it. a ranked ballot system would mean perpetual liberal governments since most people would just choose them after the ndp or conservatives.
