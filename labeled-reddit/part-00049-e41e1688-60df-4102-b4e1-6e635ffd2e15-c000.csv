here's my thought on that. the ndp have no chance of forming a government, so their policies are at best hypothetical. if the liberals are elected to another minority, then the ndp is in a position to push a lot more aggressive schedule for ramping up price per tonne. if the tories win a majority, the ndp policy is irrelevant, and even if the tories form a minority, we have lessons from the harper years that they will stymy any attempts at an aggressive pricing schedule at every single opportunity.

for me, that suggests a liberal minority with the ndp in a stronger position with a larger caucus is by far the best possible outcome. anything that puts the tories in power is going to see the even modest advanced the liberals have made either stymied or outright interfered with.",liberals

the can't give you the risks short or long term of the treatment because they don't know. but the potential risks are a page long.  do you think they are told this other than an \"experimental vaccine\"? as well, in many places like canada no other option has been made available and has even been suppressed even though there is growing evidence that these treatments are effective and can reduce the severity of covid by 50%.  they also want to start vaccination children when the evidence shows they are way better off not getting it because the risks of the virus are so small for them.

&gt;the climate action incentive (cai) payment consists of a basic amount and a 10% supplement for residents of small and rural communities. this payment may reduce your amount payable or increase your refund when you file your income tax and benefit return.

[source](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-45110-climate-action-incentive.html).

currently because you claim the credit when you file your taxes you can use it against your tax return, but the amount you get of the rebate is not effected by how much you pay in tax, your job, etc. 

so nothing happens to the amount of the rebate in any situation you mentioned there. 

this is precisely why it does still motivate individuals to go green who can afford too. for instance if you get a $300 rebate but spent $200 dollars because of the carbon price you're up $100. however if you make choices to only pay $100 due to the carbon price you still get a $300 rebate so now you're up $200.

yes, nothing is stopping them if they for some reason don't want to have more money. just as nothing is stopping someone from simply ignoring the green fund o'toole wants to set up.

not only is this reversal on the idea of a carbon tax (hypocritical, but politicians are allowed to change their minds), it's a reversal on the _most conservative part_ of the existing carbon tax plan: the cash rebates.  somehow, the cpc is here deciding that government-knows-best, and the lpc has decided that people can be trusted with money.

i'm also concerned about that first paragraph, where \"the conservatives would divert revenues to\" the personal account.  i _hope_ this is just a gloss over \"you still get a flat annual rebate, just in this hideously more awkward form,\" but it could also refer to something like a purchase-time rebate on carbon-intensive goods.  that would be even more harebrained since it would involve big brother literally inspecting your purchases on an individualized basis.",conservatives

&gt; if it's like interact, it would be available at every single bank free of charge. because it would be at every institution, no single consortium would be benefitting. the banking industry as a whole would likely benefit from it though. for example rbc might have their account have slightly better interest rates than it's competitors. or maybe cibc has an easy withdraw system for buying green products. 

how do you define what are these \"green\" things you can buy?  how is this \"bank account\" supposed to differentiate these things?   so hypothetically if i want to buy a burger at mcds with this new debit card.. it'll get rejected?  do you understand the complexity there is to implement all this vs just giving you the money back with a click of a button on a tax return?

i assume you don’t understand socialism super well because it doesn’t entail the absolute destruction of capital as like... an ideal? that’s not what socialism is. socialist societies typically involve a lot of distribution of capital. furthermore the things that made nazi germany “socialist” was the redistribution of wealth via higher taxes and expanded social systems, which coincided with the rampant tribalism of nazi germany. 

for the “dems connection ti the military industrial complex” i would need some citations, the modern democratic party is entirely based around minimal military spending relative to the federal budget, using military might as more of a deterrent than a response. the modern democratic are much less hawkish and focused more on expansion of social services. you can say whatever you want about them from the 50s but at the end of the day you could also say that the republicans freed the slaves, you’d be right but completely missing my point. 

finally, although i may not be here to argue this at all: capitalism is fairly effective with regulation and improvements. the idea that it’s all “the interest of capital” is a problem is silly. when the interest of capital coincides with regulations and expansion of social programs, it usually leads to the interest of citizens and improves the average life of the poorest people.

- dominique angalade is ex-caq and since this isn’t about racism, homophobia, sexism or xenophobia on legault’s part she has no criticism to give. she was a bad pick for leadership and would probably gladly rename the plq as caq lite^tm “*now with less racism*”. 

- covid has really exposed how little separatists have thought through a lot of their positions.things like wars and natural disasters have always been hand waved away as arguments.  in this pandemic québec would hav been positively royally screwed if it weren’t for the federal government (just imagine the long term care without the military intervention). so most of the francophone media, pq and even qs have a choice...reimagine  their entire ideology or start putting boot polish on their tongues. you’ve noticed their choice.

- the only real critics of legault these days are centrist, centre-left and leftist **federalists**. unfortunately, the rightwing take over of the entire federalist movement and sovereigntist/separatist take over of the entire québec left have utterly marginalized these voices. there’s plenty of criticism, it’s just institutionally suppressed by  political parties and media outlets who stand to lose power they gained in these takeovers. after legault's win the plq had an opportunity to go back to being the party that beat these type of right wingers in the mid 20th century, the party where both rene lesveque and p.e. trudeau were prominent members, a centre left party... they said no.",liberals

obama showing support for one pm whom he has worked with and whose views he shares is neither strange nor harmful.  obama is literally going around the world making speeches, this is his arena. why exactly would he stay silent? canada, europe and much of the globe expressed clear dislike for trump, for instance.  just as our leaders do not hesitate to call out other governments and show support for certain ideologies over others. this isn't unprecedented. 

not to mention that there is and has been a growing worry about far-right ideologies and white supremacy having a resurgence. so within that context, which was clearly a big conversation in america (and elsewhere) during his last presidency and following the end of his tenure, his endorsement makes perfect sense -- a big fear in canada is a conservative rule right now which is a party that is perceived to be friendly to those crowds. at least for the liberals and general people who would fall within the voting block of obama (and trudeau).

1. (former) american presidents commenting on canadian politics ain't great.
1. it's even *more* problematic when a lot of canadians actually care what that president thinks.  obama *is* pretty popular in canada, and in spite of the fact that i actually admire the guy (at least as american politicians go), i think it's at best neutral and at worst it undermines domestic political issues for him to weigh in.  wtf does obama have to offer on truth and reconciliation, canadian federal-provincial relations, canada's response to climate change, our covid-19 recovery or any one of a range of issues that even the least qualified leadership candidate in canada is likely to be more familiar with?  he's just a celebrity pundit with good looks and a mean golf swing.  in the same way that paul martin's not calling into radio shows in glasgow to share his thoughts on scottish independence, i don't really care to hear obama's thoughts on who our next pm should be.

so to kick a dead horse, what i'm getting at is that popular presidents are even worse commentators than unpopular presidents.  richard nixon wasn't going to swing a lot of votes against trudeau, but somebody like obama, who is about as well respected as an american politician gets in canada, is a lot more concerning -- even if you think he has our best interests at heart.

living next door to the united states means that we're always going to be heavily influenced by the domestic and geopolitical concerns of a neighbour that we're already socially and politically inclined toward.  most countries have a stronger sense of self-determination and independence than a lot of canadians hold when they look at our relationship with the us.  if trump has taught us anything, one of those lessons should be that we want americans to stick to american politics and we should expect canadians to stick to canadian politics, at least inasmuch as they aren't dual-citizens.  next time the popular guy might not be a centrist who supports the status quo, or democracy...",liberals

hd5kbtw,2021-09-16T11:31:18.000-07:00,"liberals’ home savings account proposal a ‘gimmick’ that leaves low-income renters behind, analysts say &gt; by contrast, the primary residence exemption, a handout directed to the homeowners who have most profited from the housing crisis, runs $7b per year. we are spending twice as much rewarding the winners of this crisis than on affordable housing.

four times.  larger than the homebuyers' exemption is the non-taxation of imputed rent, which ran an [estimated $8bn](https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/centre-urban-research-land-development/blog/blog49/tax_expenditures_homeowners_vs_renters_print_friendly.pdf) (pdf, figure 1) of foregone income^(&amp;dagger;) in 2017.

we just don't talk about it because it's an invisible benefit; homeowners don't actually receive a dollar value \"imputed rent\" by living in their home, so we don't think of it as income in the first place.  but if you take a homeowner, sell their house, invest the proceeds, and use income from those investments to pay rent, then the investment income is most certainly taxed.

of course, rather than tax imputed rent it would be more politically palatable to give a tax benefit to actual renters.  

&gt;  while this might feel like it helps first-time buyers, it's more likely to end up inflating prices further and actually padding the pockets of incumbent homeowners. the ndp unfortunately supports some homebuyer subsidies as well, but they actually offer some real solutions too. the rent subsidy promises direct relief to people struggling with rent while a promise to build 500,000 affordable homes will provide longer-term improvements and give canada's an affordable housing sector in line with other first-world nations.

there's more similarity than differences in these proposals.  if housing supply is so inelastic that benefits offered to homebuyers bit up prices, rental supply will also be so inelastic that rent subsidies will be captured by landlords.  rent control is applied erratically, and if it's strong enough to prevent landlord capture (given inelastic supply) then it's also strong enough to _cause_ that inelastic supply of rental housing.

building 500,000 affordable housing units sounds like quite a bit, but it's also only enough for a [third](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-research/housing-research/core-housing-need) of families with \"core housing need.\"  without a great deal of other, new construction, the housing situation at the end of a hypothetical ndp term would be similar to the current state of affairs.

constructing market-rate housing is far, far less sexy, but recent work [suggests](https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/181666/vatt-working-papers-146-city-wide-effects-of-new-housing-supply--evidence-from-moving-chains.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isallowed=y) (pdf) that new market-rate housing helps even the lower-rent segment by \"moving chains\", where people who move into the new units vacate their older places, which are then occupied by slightly lower-income families, and so on.  [overall](https://research.upjohn.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1334&amp;context=up_workingpapers) (also pdf), there is little evidence that market-rate housing raises local rents, and $1 in subsidy goes much further towards market-rate housing than specifically affordable housing, since the subsidy needs to make up much less of the gap.

&gt; the rent subsidy promises direct relief 

i'll note with a great deal of disdain that the ndp appears to have not submitted this proposal to the pbo for costing.  despite a $1bn/yr estimate in their fiscal plan, it's not at all clear to me who would be eligible to claim this benefit or how.  [contemporaneous reporting](https://globalnews.ca/news/5957345/ndp-rent-subsidy-canada-election/) suggested that this program would also require a provincial financial contribution, so that's bound to be popular.

^(&amp;dagger; &amp;mdash; mind you, if imputed rent was considered income, then a mortgage to buy a principal residence would also be a loan taken out to generate income; mortgage interest would be almost automatically tax-deductible as a result, in the same way interest on an investment loan is tax deductible.  i do not know if this analysis includes that offset.)",liberals

middle class is similar, maybe they get back what they pay, but also aren't terribly carbon intensive (probably drive a reasonable car, aren't flying all over the place, small house, etc.) and also don't have any extra money to spend on carbon reducing technology.  so again, this is not helping in any way.

and the rich, don't really need to do anything.  they can and will simply pay, if they want to. or reduce carbon, if they want to. the tax is really little incentive for them.

i just downsized my my rv trailer and converted it to a fully off-grid zero-carbon power system, because i want to. that alone cost $5000.  but i never would have done it if it wasn't a passion project for me, because economically, it makes no sense.

the issues with implementing pharmacare is the same one that plagues canada in a lot of ways: our broken federalism. our country is designed in a poor way: provinces deliver social programs, and the federal government funds them. if the federal and provincial governments don't dovetail, then new programs cannot be established. [most premiers do not want to establish pharmacare](https://ipolitics.ca/2019/12/03/premiers-offer-tepid-words-about-feds-pharmacare-pledge/) of the big four provinces, only bc is in favour, with quebec content to maintain its own pharmacare system while opposing national standards. ontario and alberta are staunchly opposed. for buying drugs in bulk, you need to have the provinces on board, especially ontario and quebec. without it there's no point.

in normal times, the federal government has very little leverage in forcing the provinces to support a program: which is to cut funding for other stuff, particularly health care transfers. during the pandemic and recession, this is an obvious non-starter. 

this is also a major issue with how canadians see our governance. we think that the federal government is the most important by far. but for the plurality of canadians, what happens in queens park is more important than in ottawa. you can direct your anger at the federal gov, but that won't accomplish anything. that's part of my issue with the headline: there's no focus at all on the two biggest obstacles to national pharmacare: **doug ford** and **françois legault**.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/gun-crime-statistics-canada-research-1.5579971

here's what we don't know however, and there will likely be some studies that get done on the topic. what happens to the illicit handgun market ie importation when you place additional constraints on the licit one. from the same article above it talks about how statscan will try to update how police collect data for the ucr (uniform crime reporting). trying to source firearms will help to see what the largest suppliers are to the illicit market. 

looking at california as an example their more restrictive laws have moved them roughly into one of the bottom 20% for deaths from guns per capita. the obvious limitation here is that there's no border, and thus the banned items can still freely flow inter-state. 

https://www.csmonitor.com/usa/justice/2021/0528/california-has-the-most-gun-control-laws-in-us.-do-they-work

but i don't think it's realistic to label the rollout as a \"failure\" the way people have been doing based on these extremely preliminary, narrow, and short term results, nor do i think it's useful to compare us to the usa or uk given how much more wealth and influence those countries have. this is a giant logistics operation with a lot of moving parts and needs to be treated as such. there is a reason that companies produce their results quarterly and not weekly or monthly - it's just not a sensible way to measure progress or run a project. what has happened is that preliminary results are not meeting expectations. that is a problem and absolutely needs to be addressed and so far what we are hearing is that fixing this is the #1 priority.

the primary metric to watch is and always has been the 6 million doses by march 31.  that is the deliverable that is mandated in the contracts and that is the promise that has been made and reiterated to canadians by the government. so far we are hearing that we are still on track to meet that number despite these delays. if that doesn't happen then we absolutely have a problem but for now everyone needs to take a deep breath and stop panicking about what might ultimately amount to no more than a speed bump.",liberals

again, i get it. but the federal government can't operate in a vacuum, even if it hasn't any direct say or influence over provincial policies it still has to work with and around them, and when you have 13 different jurisdictions to take into account it's going to be impossible to please everyone.

&gt;but that wasn't the question, the question was what i think the feds  could have done better. i listed those things, and i don't see anyone  actually disagreeing with them.

hindsight is wonderful, isn't it. should the feds have done a deal with cansino? should they have waited for moderna or pfizer? should they have ordered more vaccines earlier... or later? and the vaccination program is largely based on supply (which has been erratic), the implementation of which is in the hands of the provinces (see above for those issues). hindsight.

producing vaccines locally is certainly a good idea, such a shame the harper government cut funds for r&amp;d and production. that was ground that shouldn't have been lost, and while it makes sense to fund vaccine research &amp; production **now** it was a much more difficult decision this time last year when there were more immediate concerns. that quite aside from the fact that building a modern vaccine production facility (especially for mrna vaccines) would take a few years at least, making it still ineffective today even if it had been started a year ago. hindsight.

border and other restrictions is one thing that i agree should have been handled in a harsher fashion at the federal level. limiting travel into and out of the country and between the provinces could then and still now help restrict spread. sadly, a lot of action that could have been taken can't be taken without invoking federal emergency powers that several premiers (like kenny) would immediately decry as \"autocratic &amp; dictatorial\", which would  have resulted in civil unrest that impacted the pandemic response. so, yes, that was a political decision and not a public health one - the pm was relying on a bunch of children doing the right thing without smacking them across the ear, and he was wrong. hindsight.

we can make judgments now based on information that was not available to the federal government at the time, and there was likely information available to the federal government that we know nothing about (and never will). either could have changed decisions at the time but are basically meaningless speculation **now** unless you have absolute proof that an action taken was **knowingly** the wrong one at the time.",liberals

but i do agree that canada's discipline is way stricter than it needs to be. the uk has backbenchers electing the committee chairs by a house vote that is often contested, the people to be on the committees are backbenchers elected by the backbenchers, they get dedicated days to propose ideas independent of the leadership, and they have the ability to depose the party leader if they need to. as well, people can be on the list for pmqs through backbench support and don't ask scripted questions.

in parties like new zealand labour, the caucus also elects whom among themselves become ministers when in government and who becomes opposition critics when not in government.

and the conservatives in canada actually need a vote of the plenum to dismiss members from the caucus.

$200/sqft x 2,000sqft = $400,000 + land cost vs $300/sqft x 2,000sqft = $600,000 + land costs. even if the land still costs the same per sqft the value of the house has risen with commodity market related supply and demand and inflation of all the other parts of the job. just like if you had 100lbs of copper sitting for two years it will have doubled in value so does the house made of wood, copper, brick, drywall and the labour cost of all the work that went into it. there is obviously some depreciation on an older home versus a modern one but it is still valued at the sum of its parts not because the resources are extractable but because that's what it costs to make a new one on that piece of land.

the pandemic caused a rethinking of how and where people live. many small families or young couples ditched their inner city condos and townhouses for more spacious suburban homes. lastly we have ultra low interest rates on mortgages making funding very accessible to people. focusing on investors and speculators is focusing on a small portion of why we have seen house prices rise.",liberals

it was an example that deficit spending doesn’t not always create gdp growth. 

the only thing i liked about harper policies was the tfsa and child fitness credits. the tfsa gave everyone some capital gains exemption which is typically only available to the rich via trust funds, incorporating etc. the child fitness tax credit encouraged participation in sports.

the debt level and deficit are not a partisan issue. there is real danger that we end up in a debt crisis. this happened under chrétien/martin. i remember stagflation. i am very concerned that current government is more concerned about winning that what is good for the country. how else could you explain the extra 500 in oas for seniors without any changes to oas? do you really think a senior with income over 79k needs that extra 500? to me that simply buying votes.

2) people immigrating to canada rarely show up and buy a home, and even if they did they are most likely canadian citizens and wouldn't be considered foreign anymore.

3) vacancy tax is actually easy to enforce. when taxes are submitted have landlords submit their tax receipts for each property each month, and each month they are missing you apply the tax. since it is all digital you can compare what the landlord has submitted vs what the supposed submitter has submitted on their tax forms. yes this would be costly for the landlord, but that is the point.

&gt; municipalities are often reluctant to change land use rules to allow higher density housing, and the **conservatives are proposing to tie federal funding for transit expansions to higher density housing near that transit.** that’s similar to policy put forward by democrats like elizabeth warren, bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio-cortez in the united states, and hemingway and somerville both say it could help unlock new housing supply.

the facts are that an independent obudsman, after receiving several more in a list of unadressed complaints about racism sexism and transphobia in the party structures recommended diversity training for the council.

that requirement was enough for may's husband to rage quit the council and cause three other long term may allies and friends to start acting like children, as documented in public documents

remember, this was just because they had to do diversity training...

a second obudsmans report was requested. that is the one republished by the g&amp;m today. that called for storey and eert and cusomano's removal from the board.

then refused to comply and literally began a campaign of obstruction and defunding the leader, demanding her removal from the party all together. then they decided, despite the fact that they were not even supposed to be on the board anymore to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of party donation on court fees to hold their volunteer positions.

but it's paul who is tearing the party down?

and before it gets said, zatzmans tweet was exactly what would happen to an mp who attacked any other party leaders statement on anything on twitter. if atwin did that today with trudeau what is described in his response would be a matter of fact not a threat.

property taxes are calculated such that you pay a portion of municipal service costs based on the *relative* value of your property.

so a home that costs 2x as much as another will pay for a greater share of municipal service costs. if both houses double in value they still pay the same share of service costs. if the first doubles in price, then the first persons prop tax goes up and the second goes down (they split the service costs 50/50 now as opposed to 33/66 from before).

this doesn't apply to municipal levies that are added to property tax bills for ease of collection, those are usually flat fees or flat tax rates.",liberals

the original position is that trudeau isn't going to be stepping down or ousted because people don't like him.

he's the most favourably viewed leader of all parties in the linked poll.

he might step down or be ousted for running a bad campaign, or having a shit election timing call, or any number of reasons.

but \"people don't like trudeau and that's why they lost\" isn't the reason.

if more people like him than the party, he's not as a personality *the* reason they lost. there's bleed sure. but there are other spurious reasons for lpc vote intention being lower such as calling an election during the fourth wave. that could have had a similar effect regardless of the leader who had done it for the cpc.

it's more that the argument people hate him and that's why he's gonna lose doesn't hold water with this data. the only cohort for which his personal favourability is tied to with this data is conservative voters. who nearly 100% of which dislike trudeau and for nearly half of which the reason is to vote him out rather than vote for otoole. the other parties have way lower ratios of \"keep someone out of office\" ton\"vote because i believe in the platform\". 

this data suggests that otoole is the one people are holding their noses and voting for moreso than trudeau, and that his being leader isn't as impactful among people who aren't cpc intention at the time of the poll. 

we'd need to do a long period comparison to see the favourability shift and the actual impact it has in % of committed cpc voters who are voting against trudeau to definitively say what impact his personal popularity and favourability shifts might be having on the campaign.

this snapshot suggests it's almost no real impact at this point. whatever negative sentiment shifted the numbers it looks like it's baked into the cpc intention camp at this point and if the cpc continue to slide slowly or stabilize at this number then trudeau's favourability rating becomes a moot point.",liberals

we have a serious issue as a country, not just toronto, with the runaway financialization of housing and our political leaders complete denial and lack of addressing the housing crisis and the dynamics that create it — a crisis which is also expanding across the country ever-increasingly and that will not be solved in any meaningful systematic by telling people to just move. people moving out of toronto is just going to make it worse elsewhere and push people out of other places. it's already happening. is that kind of cycle and result one that a \"great\" country should regard as the best that it can do?

the only remotely new substantive issues in this election are housing and possibly child care. the liberals have already made some progress on federal/provincial child care deals, so we know what that looks like. and they’re pretty clearly not interested in changing the status quo on housing, since their victory depends on affluent older gta/gva suburban homeowners with big fat housing gains who the liberals are clearly terrified of pissing off. it’s pretty obvious this is why they’re so mushy and listless on housing - they feel like they’re boxed in. so what even would the liberals say about housing? if they release a platform on housing now it will be clear to voters that the cupboard is bare, kind of like how the ontario pcs pulled the same stunt in 2018.

it’s really quite interesting to see some of the demographic level mainstreet polls. the ndp and cpc are polling strongest by far among 18-34, whereas the lpc have barely any of their support from that age group but are very strong within 65+. my read is the ndp and cpc are capitalizing on housing related anger and the lpc aren’t even trying, avoiding ambitious policy and obfuscating their affordable housing investments to placate their older core demographics who are less preoccupied with housing affordability.",liberals

also, the charter guarantees freedom of conscience and religion. employers can potentially make requirements that might contradict those but they do not have carte blanche and could be sued in court. requiring doctors to make referrals is reasonable but i am fairly confident that a law requiring them to actual perform acts that violated conscience would likely not hold up to a constitutional challenge.

here is the full text of section 43 about language.

notice how the constitutional text refers to an amendment to \"any provision\" that relates to the use of english or french? this is a massive difference because we now have to read section 43 as protecting amendments only to rights expressly referred to in the 1867 constitution or 1982 charter instead of any amendment that would relate to the use of french and english in the province period (as the globe and mail seeks to push). 

in short, the constitution provisions protect:

* in the 1867 constitution, rights to receive a trial in both languages as well as the right to have both laws published in both languages, which isn't affected by the proposed bill.
* in the 1982 charter, the right to be educated in the minority language of choice if you are part of that minority, which isn't affected by the proposed bill.

* catch our last window to get grandfathered in if grandfathering's allowed, or 

* drum up the expense of the dumb policy if the buyback's made mandatory, making it a bitterer pill to pass and cost similar moves in the future. the gov't is required to pay full market value for anything confiscated in this manner, and i mean to make the implementation as painful of a process as possible by every legal means available.

i bought four such guns in the last year that are currently legal, three of which i'd've been in no rush to get if it weren't for those two factors and the potential of a dwindling time window.

for the gun owners out there: if you have a tax return coming and discretionary spending for sporting/hunting gear, consider picking up a non-restricted semi that's likely to be on the chopping block the next time justin needs to distract from a scandal. it'll make the prospect of a mandatory buyback a *much* more expensive proposition: you'll get to make the implementation harder, or else get grandfathered in for a new class.",liberals

alberta has by and large got by because of o&amp;g royalties, but like any resource royalties, they are prone to wild commodity swings, which means revenues go up and then revenues go down, and alberta has shown remarkably little discipline since the 1990s in maintaining its heritage fund, which means there is no way to deal with the inevitable price drops, and leaves the province highly vulnerable to commodity collapses. the point of a pst is that it gives the provincial treasury an at least semi-predictable cash flow.

for a province that prides itself on its industry and business sensibilities, it seems to have darned little knowledge that any significant revenue generating enterprise requires cash flow just as much as it requires profits.",conservatives

and yet if you don't try that then nothing ever happens and change is never possible. maybe down in the united states it works to be polarizing, but in canada it does not. if you want to get something done you need to convince people and most people are not in the business of supporting craziness.

well no :) that was over by then :) 

as for martin - the bad offsets a lot of the good. taking 70 billion out of the ei program was pretty bad. he slashed payments to the provinces and downloaded costs - there's only one tax payer as the saying goes, people were still stuck with that. and he handled the corruption poorly.  still - cpp board was good. and even if he did it in a highly questionable way the books got balanced. 

harper's best years probably were the minority years. but - c'mon, lets not kid ourselves that the opposition stopped him from doing anything he wanted  :) even when they  flexed for one time he still wound up winning in the end. but the voters did send a more clear message - we will vote for you when you deal with the economy and other important issues, we won't if you waste time with stupid bullcrap like fighting gay marriage. and that's as it should be. 

freeland is a horrible finance minister, and i cannot for the life of me understand why liberals like her at all. if you look at her actual track record she has failed across the board,  the eu negotaitons, the free trade deal, venezuela, china, and now a budget that is a complete shit show and will plunge the country into a debt/deficit cycle for at least a decade. 

martin got a kick at the can because he stood up to chretien and that appealed to people who didn't like the corruption of the chretien years. but i think freeland will likely go down with justin's ship. she's too closely associated with him and when he falls out of favour she will likely fall with him. 

still - it's canadian politics and you just never know :)  so i guess we'll see.

i’m not sure about that, i take the jolly cut daily for work and they all seem to go the speed limit (it’s a slower road than most drivers like to pretend it is!). the real choke point is james south; buses pile up behind each other in front of st joes and augusta- during busy hours, the bus schedule has reached saturation there and throwing more buses at it just results in greater pileups. we need a larger vehicle (like lrt) that moves more people at once, but it won’t be easy to implent there at all due to the geography. a tram would be neat, but given that the concession street area isn’t really a hub of intense development, having another transit link ( bus, tram, bus) would just push more people into driving.",liberals

say it with me now

&amp;#x200b;

we have the production capacity to meet the demands. 

there used to be a day when if everyone a new invention called a tv - they had to make enough.. and if everyone all of a sudden had jobs and disposable income we cant make enough tvs so we sell them to who can pay the most.  its the other side of supply and demand.  the supply is low, demand is high. price is high.  the 70's  was a breaking point for the west where their consumption was greater than their production and as a result the cost of goods sky rocketed.  the value of the money remained the same but the cost of goods raised because the supply of goods was lowered.

enter china

china makes everything.  problem solved.   the only thing china doesnt make, we see a supply shortage of.

&amp;#x200b;

so lets let china make our houses..... ? 

k the last bit was in jest but really-- global trade has reduced the burden of local manufacturing and the supply of goods has been met in abundance.   inflation wont increase so long as we can make everything .

notice the price of wood in the pandemic renovatation fever market? thats inflation.  why arent we buying wood from china / russia? dilute the market and lower the price again
