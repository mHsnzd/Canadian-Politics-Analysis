the only example that comes to my mind of a leader not saying they’ll win is kathleen wynne in 2018. 

cohn should understand this, the opposition parties are probably not going to talk about what they’d do if ford was reduced to a minority unless it actually turns out that way. if they did, you can imagine ford’s attack ads painting every party as beholden to the “radical socialist ndp”. 

and, might i remind cohn, that when the federal liberals and ndp tried to form a coalition in 2008, it didn’t work out too well for the opposition parties.

any suggestion that quebec should assimilate to the anglophone majority of the roc, or that this would be beneficial to either party, is ridiculous.

however, there is a sense (perhaps due to misunderstandings) that some quebecois give off when they bring up the \"equal partners in confederation\" argument: that they believe that quebec should be treated as equal to every other province *combined*.  this is of course equally ridiculous, quebec is just one of 10 provinces now and outside of their provincial jurisdiction is - and should be - treated as such.",liberals

besides the language divide, the current polls are also reflective of a fairly recent, fairly steep decline in higgs' approval, owed partly to a variety of factors including mixed pandemic messaging going back to the end of the summer, his refusal to raise lumber royalties despite soaring prices, and a fairly unpopular labour dispute with nb cupe (and others i have failed to mention, i am sure). how much will these missteps affect an election 3 years away, and how will higgs manage the rest of his term, are both to be determined.

yes ndp does good in cities but that’s not where their support comes from. remember, liberals hold every seat in toronto, mississauga, and brampton and every seat but 1 in montreal. ndp has 0 seats in the gta which is where most poc live in canada. liberals do really well with non-whites, especially amongst black and south asian communities. if you look at ridings such as humber-river black creek, scarborough rouge park, york-south weston, all of brampton... this is where liberals get 50+ of the vote share and where you will find poc a larger share of the electorate . cpc minority support mostly comes from asians and south asians as well. the asian vote is generally a swing between liberals and cpc. 

richmond is predominantly asian and cpc holds both seats in richmond, liberals hold every seat surrey. liberals holds seats in delta, north vancouver and west vancouver. ndp does hold two seats in burnaby but liberals also has a seat there.  also provincial politics =\\ = federal politics. 

the ndp support in cities mostly come from younger voters, this does includes young poc. but again overwhelming white. ndp does well in rural areas and smaller cities such as hamilton, windsor, london, victoria, and across vancouver island where you find less people of colour.

i’m just speaking from personal experience but as a black canadian. those in my family and community groups were pretty much all liberal (to be fair i did grow up in toronto so a lot of it is just natural support). one thing that liberals do really well is having ongoing connection with cultural and religious groups. which pays big time when election time comes.",liberals

now, could it be that canadian society overwhelmingly votes in a liberal manner because, simply put, there is nothing else being offered? no socially conservative alternative? 

but a better question would be: is what social conservatives proposes really that radical or out of the mainstream worldwide? 

1) abortion
we should pass a law that bans late term and sex selective abortions and gives more options and help to women with unintended pregnancies to encourage them to not kill their baby. 

polls indicate most canadians would support this?
where is the radical? 
do you really think so-cons want a vatican style full on abortion ban? really? 
most countries around the world do not allow abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy? canada has zero limits. restricting abortion is not something uncommon, rather it is the norm everywhere. 

2) lgbt stuff
gay marriage is a dead issue in canada. there is nobody, not even the most devout social conservatives, actively campaigning to abolish gay marriage in canada. that is simply just stupid fear mongering by the left. 

however, there are other aspects of the lgbt agenda that are quite disturbing and worthy of challenging. particularly sex reassignment surgery and and hormonal treatments, particularly with minors. why are parents being thrown in jail for refusing to consent to their kids taking hormonal puberty blockers? why are kids even being allowed to do so? shouldn't there be a law that says that there should be a minimum age, say 16-18, in order to initiate treatment? hell, is that why there is even laws of consent and everyday restrictions on minors? 

the uk recently did this, banning treatments for minors. tell me, is the uk a bastion of religious social conservatism? 

3) immigration.
a lot of canadians are sick and tired of the excessive immigration levels that we have and would actually like to see it reduced. the idea that canadians are a jolly good bunch who can't get enough of immigrants and want endless waves coming in is a dumb stereotype that needs to die.

polls confirm this: canadians want less immigration. 
high levels of immigration lead to all kinds of tension: depressed wages, unaffordable housing, collapsed healthcare system etc etc etc.

so my question to you as a liberal: what did i propose here that is too much for the canadian people as a whole? why cant elections possibly be won under this message as part of our social policy? 

i think smart and pragmatic social conservative policies would do wonders in this country. 

there just needs to be a firm leader willing to sell them to the public and to be able to resist and counter the nonsensical attacks from the left.

but we don't have that.",conservatives

&gt;they didn’t ‘get lucky’, they created the conditions for economic growth through monetary policy.

never happened economy was stagnant lower then expected growth

no source not surprising where not shifting, where slowly moving oil is expanding till 2030 i havn't seen any **massive** government investment in green energy or retooling.

&gt;but since, canada has either led g7 countries — once, in 2017 — or been second in annual growth behind the united states.

again being dishonest. our annual growth should not be compared to the manufacturing superpower. the fact remains as ive shown. even with unprecendeted massive spending the liberals manage to deliver an economy that had a lower average growth then g7 nations that didn't inject such a ludicrous amount of stimulus.

&gt;the most common measure of economic growth is percentage increases in gross domestic product, which is a measure of the overall value of nation’s economy. 2014-2015 we saw a huge dip. enter the liberals.

from my perspective of the same gun issue: it may have been poorly reported, but the majority of canadians are content with the current gun laws are are upset with gun crime. the politicians make a claim or press release, and the cbc reported on that, whereas perhaps they should have focused more critical of the politicians making claims. or does not mean the cbc is left-leaning, it means that they can be a bit too focused on sensationalism (as a lot of news broadcasters can be) and not critical enough of the government/politicians.

in my experience, in 2001, they were mostly uncritical of canada joining in the afghan coalition, whereas the canadian left is largely pacifist or critical of any military aggression. they then largely ignored the issue for 20 years unless a canadian was killed or there was a particular scandal. to me, that's not leftist at all.",liberals

- i think you mean that i’m saying that saying that suburbs are not a valid option for affordable housing — and that saying that is the “false dilemma”

1. you may be right, but tbh it’s the obvious conclusion when   a) the stated platform proposes selling 15% of all crown lands (i.e. federal government property) which mostly is not in urban areas / close to city centres   b) it’s the conservative party of canada (supported largely by suburban and rural voters) — i don’t think these are unexpected assumptions

2. “there is nothing inherent about suburbs being unaffordable” — yes both for the city and for individuals — upkeep and mai fence of suburban roads is a major issue (look into if you want) — forcing people to own a car just to get around is not quite in-line with creating housing that reduces the cost of living

3. “nothing inherent about suburbs being far from public transit” — actually, by definition, the sparsity of suburban development means most people are further from public transit than a walkable neighbourhood (trust me, i’ve lived in my fair share of suburbia close to public transit) and without a car you are a second class citizen

4. fund more public transit! yes! this is exactly what we need (hence why i shall be voting ndp) (but honestly more important is provincial and municipal politics for local change)

in 2017 - 26 thousand.  in 2018  - 23 thousand  in 2019  - 28 thousand. 

and it's about the same right now. low to mid 20's. 

[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/statistics/economy/building-permits/econ\\_housing\\_starts\\_urban\\_communities.pdf](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/statistics/economy/building-permits)s/econ\\_housing\\_starts\\_urban\\_communities.pdf

now lets look at vancouver's population. 

[https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20404/vancouver/population](https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20404/vancouver/population)

yep - nice straight line increase. vancouver added about 300 thousand people in the last 10 years as permanent residents, and yet the number of homes built in that time is closer to about 200 thousand,  and a lot of those destroyed existing homes to be built.  and a lot became airbnb's etc.  there's about an average of 2 people per home.   a lot of those homes were single bedroom apartments. 

and because this has been a problem since about 2000, we now have fewer homes than we need. guess what happens to prices when demand exceeds supply. 

so the reality of the matter is - we are not building enough homes.  period. no 'foreign tax scheme' or any other program is going to put a stop to this unless we build more homes at a faster rate than we have been. 

we need to increase new home starts by about 20 percent in most of our more populated and popular areas if we're going to have a snowball's chance of getting price increases under control. 

so what do we do about that. right now the answer is nothing. people are happy with the liberals'  half assed promises which will do nothing whatsoever. and every year we wait to actually do something about it the supply/demand difference gets worse, meaning it will take that much longer of extra building above supply to bring it back in line. meanwhile, the 'tax the rich' and anti-business stance they're demanding reduces investment in new buildings. 

the morons who complain about this and yet vote liberal are screwing themselves out of a future. and every year we continue to underbuild means another year more we'll have to over build just to get back to balance.  which means that date is moving away faster and faster.  right now it would probably take about 5 years of building 20 percent more than we are now just to stop the runaway price increases, and because of how the red tape works if we decided to do that today those homes wouldn't actually be completed for more like 7 years. 

this is why they've  been predicting a housing bubble burst for 20 years that has never happened.

opposition parties can explicitly present a no confidence motion, which would only pass if they have a majority of mps voting in favour

otherwise, the usual way it happens is when the government declares a bill to be a question of confidence explicitly. this is the situation the article and commenters are discussing. the liberals would be the ones triggering an election by deeming something a confidence question when they’re not sure it would pass. 

the third way are those where by convention it’s a question of confidence : supply motions, budgetary policy motions, and motions respecting the address in reply of the throne speech. in those cases you could make the argument that opposition parties can band together and decide to force an election but it still requires the government to be unwilling to compromise on their policies. 

situations 2 and 3 depend on the government presenting legislation that they don’t have support to pass. in those they are virtually always just as much in control if not more so (they are setting the agenda after all) of an election trigger as any opposition party.
