hm1c7pv,2021-11-24T22:27:59.000-08:00,"the conservatives' inflation argument is flawed — but it still might work i think the reason they deflect, as you put it (and i tend to agree), regarding these bigger economic issues is because, while they have some tools to deal with the problems we’re facing, those tools aren’t really sufficient to easily fix anything. 

if it’s a social issue, they can introduce legislation, ensure their mps attend a few rallies, and stick to the right talking points in qp and in interviews. they can look like they’re doing all the right things and either (i) nothing changes but nobody notices, or (ii) things actually do improve for a small group of people but still nobody really notices. it’s all performative.

with these macro economic issues, however, not only is it unclear whether their tools will actually work, but a lot of people are going to be negatively impacted by whatever they do. in that case, it’s better for them to just sit on their hands and deflect.",conservatives

this is a bit of fiction. house flipping prior to 2010 was a pretty poor way to build wealth (delivering way below market returns than the stock market with far more tax exposure), and even after 2010 it really depended on where your housing was located. house flipping has always been a thing, but usually only among seasoned tradespeople (meanwhile most politicians probably probably can't even patch dry wall).

moving to potentially open up to reservations that sit on borders so that there can be more open cooperation between reservation law enforcement, rcmp and other lea’s as necessary. reservations that cannot or do not cooperate should be assessed appropriately. 

federal funds and cooperation on tangible community policing and social initiatives that aim to target youth in the communities most affected by firearms related violence. outreach programs, bursary’s and funds, etc. more infrastructure development, etc. change people’s lives early so they have choices that don’t involve gangbanging.

the idea shouldn’t be to strictly bolster border security; because it isn’t realistic to just randomly search vehicles all the time. there needs to be cross border cooperation for intelligence gathering operations and enforcement. there needs to be federal and provincial cooperation at the highest level. if illegal firearms are as big a deal as the liberals are indicating then we should be addressing the root issues that lead to this type of violence as well as the organizations and individuals smuggling firearms.",liberals

hbkez8x,2021-09-03T23:34:05.000-07:00,"conservatives would repeal ban on guns used in école polytechnique, nova scotia mass shootings this is patently false.

it’s much easier to cause mass casualties with a truck than a gun.

it requires a fair bit of training to be accurate when shooting a gun. it also requires a fair bit of technical skill to disassemble and clean it so that it operates properly when you’re shooting, and even more technical skill to remedy a stoppage in the field.

so much so that many shooters who experience a stoppage just abandon their weapon altogether and switch to a different one.

most of the skill involved in driver training for a u-haul (which is what alex menassian used) is in knowing the rules of the road. rules which don’t matter much when you intend to violate all of them.

as a matter of fact it’s so easy to cause mass casualty events with a truck that it happens all the time without the truck driver even intending it. just add a couple shots of vodka to the mix and that aspect is even worse.

a truck is also much more easily obtainable than a firearm. alex menassian went to a u-haul store with a driver’s license and left with a truck.

oh, and a knife can be used to obtain the vehicle you will use to cause mass casualties. to say nothing of the fact that mass casualty events account for only a tiny percentage of violence despite seeming “big and scary” because the liars and scam artists in news overhype those stories to sell you advertising while ignoring domestic violence because that doesn’t sell advertising.

but the fact that you only acknowledge those mass casualty events is quite disturbing. it implies that you really don’t care about crime, violence or murder at all because you’re willing to just go ahead and ignore the many many times more incidents of violence that occur that arent mass casualty events.

he was ahead by a lot and his message could have been that the cpc under him is the moderate choice to get trudeau out of office, that under him climate is still a priority and that they would be more fiscally responsible and focus on addressing inflation and affordability. 

but instead he shifted his positions, walked back and forth on guns, walked back and forth on the carbon tax, only decided to have an \"i am the only one who can bring the change you want from trudeau\" message in the last couple days only. 

he also wasn't strong enough on covid to keep the centre and we've seen them slip away.

if this platform and leader were run in 2017 they could have won and if they ran it again after covid they most certainly would have too.

but the leader was just too malleable. he ran true blue for leader went centre in a gamble and couldnt even moderate the parts of the platform that turned into poison pills that he couldn't plan ahead for.

the reason he favours a ranked ballot system is because most canadians' second choice party is the liberal party, as they are the centrist party in canada. i would imagine that a ranked ballot system would not only deliver them majority governments even more than they currently get, but with larger majorities that would open them up to being able to tinker with the constitution as well.

i've said before numerous times on this subreddit that the liberals under trudeau desire power above most other things, and this only adds fuel to that fire. he's never been interested in working with other parties or across party lines, all he's ever wanted is to make parliament a monolithic liberal party engine. people should reject that desire by the liberals with every fibre of their being. we know ottawa functions better when the parties are forced to work together, and we should all support systems that make them do so. pr is one such system.",liberals

the liberals seem overconfident in this environment because they expect to just get the votes and sail to victory on a status-quo approach off all the people who are doing mostly fine or are now in even better financial health than before and generally support the government's handling of covid. that's likely most of the people who surround them in their circles.

that's what they *actually already accomplished* so far under trudeau. their current plan includes a bill to raise the carbon rate by $15 a year until $170 in 2030. this would enable us to beat our 2030 climate targets for relatively cheap... and at the same time function as a tax on the rich. the lpc will likely win the upcoming election and with the support of the ndp, be able to pass it into law.

trudeau is also working on an international trade agreement implementing a carbon tax rate globally with the eu and a number of other partners. this is still in the early stages but looks like a promising way for canada to get the whole globe to reduce their co2 output.

smoking isn’t just dangerous to the individual, but to anyone in the vicinity of the individual while they’re partaking in the activity. there is absolutely no benefit to allowing cigarettes to exist in modern society, and yet we do because we’ve decided as a society that we tend to err on the side of allowing adults the liberty of making their own decisions — even if those decisions are misguided or even harmful to the individual.

i’m not ready to start living in a society that accepts limiting the personal freedoms of individuals (**unless** it’s for a major public good — like a vaccine/mask mandate in a pandemic) because eventually somebody with nefarious intent is going to abuse those laws/that society and really start curtailing our rights.",conservatives

as i understand it's history, it was coined by a famous british labour mp in the early-mid 20th century to describe one of the unforeseen pernicious effects of the ending of aristocratic rule in the uk. as he saw it, aristocrats were quite aware that they held their position in society because of an accident of birth, but because the society had codified the *idea* (but not the reality) that people would rise to their position through 'merit', that the people running the country had decided that they must deserve/be good at their jobs by virtue of having achieved their positions. 

the contradiction was, as he saw it: aristocrats would be happy to listen to advice from *anyone* who had proven an ability, but 'meritocrats' would firmly believe that *they* had the ability, since why else would they have the job?

as a country currently governed by a trudeau, i think we can put the meritocratic fallacy to bed. while it can be possible to rise to a high position through personal virtue and talent, most people achieve what they do through connections, accidents of birth and intergenerational wealth/power transfer. 

some countries don't bother to pretend that their leaders earned the job, but we in the west still cling to the antiquated notion that our leaders are the best in their societies - while electing the children of past leaders, or well-connected servants of monied interests to the job.

if that is the case, codify it in law.  which is exactly why i think removing the user-generated content protection was silly, which you summarily dismiss.  if it will *never* be used against user-generated content, why remove the protection in the first place?  unless you want to retain the ability to regulate user content  at some point in time.

\"“users” on sites like youtube include major record companies, hollywood studios, and other massive multinational corporations. there is effectively zero chance that individual users posting personal videos will actually be subject to regulatory requirements.\"

once again codify it.  it was actually codified with an exemption that was removed.  do not leave it up to interpretation.   that said even if some of those \"users\" are corporations, they are not distributing full features on youtube (in the case of movie or tv shows-they are promotional trailers - ie commercials) and in the case of music, are not monetizing the videos.  it's promotion directly from the artist to sell albums or get streams on a streaming service.  they release this stuff for free, which is why it is on youtube and not a subscription service.  otherwise its behind a paywall rental, which goes back to the video store analogy.  canadian artists can and do also use youtube as a promotional vehicle as well.  youtube doesn't gatekeep anything unless it breaks the law.

i think the bigger issue is that user-generated \"amateur\" content is competing with production video and eating its lunch among younger demographics, and is seen as a threat from the smaller canadian production companies.  adding regulatory hurdles to user-generated content to protect the production video industry doesn't do anyone any favours nor is there anything stopping these \"professional\" creators from going the amateur route and making youtube videos if that is where the money is.  rather than adapt to the market, they want to be protected.  why not just make youtube videos if that is what the market wants...  as professionals they would already have advantages over amateurs.

\"you’ve just argued that recommendation algorithms play an important role in spotify’s model; yet now you seem to be arguing that they don’t, because nothing “can force that”. \"

both.  one of spotify's main advantages over its rival streamers is its recommendation algorithm.  as an end-user, it will actively be worse if it is forced to inject canadian content recommendations because they just don't fit my interests.  i listen to entire genres that have little or no canadian equivalent.  (afrobeats, world music (the genre), jazz and blues, and while i don't listen to it, but kpop, jpop, latin... almost by definition can't have canadian content since the genre itself is region or language specific.  note that many of these genres are not just the from the behemoth us, but the world over and there is no reason canadian artists need protection from the rest of the world.  i don't want spotify to show me a song by trooper because they are canadian (or worse drake)!  that is actively making a product worse for me.  i will skip the song if that is the case and be annoyed because i can no longer set it and forget it.  it also makes spotify less appealing to me than apple music, since both recommendation engines are no longer accurately tailored to my taste because of forced cancon.

\"which is it? set aside whether you agree with it in principle or not for a moment—by your own logic, if legislation can force changes to the recommendation algorithm, then it can have an effect on the creators that it boosts. you may disagree that it should, but you can’t claim that it’s both effective and ineffective and assisting creators at the same time.\"

i said both because a user has to listen to at least 30 seconds of song to count as a play.  if someone skips it after a few seconds, it doesn't count as a play and the artist makes no money.  simply recommending it to people, especially if it is out of context in certain genre playlists, is anti-consumer and will turn me off the artist that gets recommended through no fault of their own.  it will not make them extra money.

it worked in the context of radio-stations because you couldn't skip songs on the radio and you were forced to listen to whatever was aired.   and it goes back to streaming not being a broadcaster in the traditional sense.  we are trying to shoehorn a broadcasting model onto and on-demand model.  what about user-generated playlists.  what if i share my own playlist, will spotify be forced to add canadian content to it, even if i didn't have it in my playlist?  that is getting into slipper charter territory there.  user-generated playlists are also big on these services...  i don't want the government forcing drake into mine...

from your last replay this is one thing i don't get, can you explain what you mean:

\"it would be their own stuff. they would not be forced to fund their competition. your statement is based on a false premise.\"

if hbomax has to put a portion of their revenue into a fund for canadian producers, but hbomax doesn't carry non-hbomax content, how can it be anything but funding their competition?  hbo is not going to buy the distribution right to a canadian produced show and rebrand it hbo.  thats not how they work, and not the trend of the industry in general.  especially with the definition of cancon being what it is.  hbo is not canadian so could never own the shows, they could only ever license them, and its not something they do.  they aren't netflix that rebrands worldwide content as netflix originals all the time (mostly foreign stuff).  the whole point of them going direct is to get rid of the middle-men (not just the distribution middle-men).  disney+ is the same thing.  thats why there is huge consolidation in the industry as a whole (outside the canadian market context).  its why disney bought fox, why at&amp;t bought warner and hbo, and then merged with discovery.  independent producers are going to go the way of the dodo...    individual creators might pitch shows but they will be owned and produced by these studios...not just financed by them for distribution rights.

my point about bell and letterkenny is that there is very little canadian content produced (in english canada), especially of the variety that counts as cancon, other than the cbc.  it was sarcastic.  ctv, global, or crave could survive without licensing us or other foreign content.

how many original (and i mean truly original - not canadian idol or amazing race canada, real housewives of toronto, etc) do our broadcasters (other than the cbc) still make, other than the news?  

i don't have a canadian inferiority complex at all.  we have excellent actors, directors, writers and other creators, excellent production crews, digital media studios, some of the best animators come from sheridan, etc...  that said i don't know what makes a show distinctly \"canadian\" that it needs protection.  if it is good it will stand on its own merit.  schitt's creek could have been anytown canada or usa, it told a story related for people on both sides of the border, the show itself actually went out of its way to not locate itself.  its not creators that are the issue.  it's the forcing of a specific version of cancon that is the issue, and the insider nature of that industry that gets the protection vs. any other canadian creator.  its why the bloc and most of quebec is in full support because its more money for french language content.",liberals

canada should absolutely not try and rework their competitive corporate and capital gains tax rates, as they will no longer be competitive globally. people need to remember how easy it is for capital to flow and companies to relocate and bring their tax revenue with them as well as employment opportunities - which costs even more tax revenue for the country and provinces.

you claim to understand the difference and then immediately go on to talk about corporate taxes, which i was not talking about. i know the second poll in the igm chicago booth link discusses corporate tax rates but i was not talking about that poll- i thought i made that clear by explicitly mentioning income tax rates and taxes on capital gains, which is what poll a in the link is about.

i am starting to think you do not understand what any of these taxes actually are or what the differences are.

the competitive nature of corporate taxes is considered extremely negative by economists, which is why they are generally [in support of the global corporate tax rate](https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/global-corporate-taxes/) proposed by the biden administration.

&gt;canada should absolutely not try and rework their competitive corporate and capital gains tax rates, as they will no longer be competitive globally. people need to remember how easy it is for capital to flow and companies to relocate and bring their tax revenue with them as well as employment opportunities - which costs even more tax revenue for the country and provinces.

again, i was not talking about corporate tax rates. your comment here also highlights your ignorance- it's not uncommon for economists to suggest lowering corporate taxes while raising capital gains taxes instead (or taxing capital gains as regular income). corporate taxes are a bad tax that is not only easily outmaneuvered by companies but is also distortionary, not to mention the \"competition\" you keep mentioning is an incredible waste of time and resources and is ultimately just a race to the bottom which is the whole reason countries are currently pursuing an agreement on a global minimum corporate tax rate.

&gt;when have i ever said this? i am simply stating that both extremes are damaging in their own way. the far-left is economically damaging the country and the far-right leads to violent extremism. i am not saying say are equal in terms of their weight, but pretending like one side has legitimacy over the other is just not right.

capital gains is profit from increased prices of assets - i.e. stocks, real estate and whatever other asset classes there are. 

i bring up corporate tax rates and focus on it because it is the most important one to maintain a competitive advantage on, without having a race to the bottom. 

income taxes are from working a regular job and gets taxed the hardest. our competitive capital gains tax and corporate tax are founded on the ideas of innovation and entrepreneurship - and capital gains in particular encourages investment. we want canadians to pursue risky ventures that pay dividends to canada tenfold if they are successful. this is what our market oriented country has its tax principles based off of. there is a very good reason for it, you choose to ignore it though because you imagine the economy to work differently, and i'd wager entirely different.

its origins lie in the centrist \"tories on bikes\" faction (though they have far more in common with the liberals than the post merger tories), being founded by defecting pcs and liberals. the problem is that  what is considered \"green politics\" on a global scale is very much in the alliance 90/greens mold: decidedly left wing if not outright eco-socialist. that doesn't mean it's *inherently* better but rather that the centrists have never presented a coherent ideology aside from going \"of course environmentalism is conservative, 'conserve' is even in the name!\"

their big tent model worked in the 90s when they were the only ones talking about the environment but now that climate change is a mainstream issue, most people who would normally fit the tories on bikes mold are just going to vote for the liberals. yeah they might do some light corruption and don't go as far on the environment file as some would like but they can form government and keep the tories out.

as a result the ranks are being filled by increasingly left-wing members because, to most people, green politics *is* left-wing. the leadership election was basically a contest between two eco-socialists and a \"moderate\" (paul) who essentially ran and leads as a dipper. so even the centrist camp has had to move leftward to maintain influence.

these two ideologies (capitalism must be directed to solve climate change vs capitalism caused/causes climate change) are contradictory. somebody has got to go and it's probably going to be the centrists. until they shrink the tent the green party is just going to continue to come off as schizophrenic.",liberals

&gt;in 2008, israeli ambassador to canada, alan baker, said he feared canadian muslims might impact canada's foreign policy. he said that the canadian muslims might push their values onto canadians, which \"wouldn't gel with canadian values of mutual respect.\" he also criticized a muslim member of parliament, omar alghabra and said that \"muslim activists\" had prevented him from speaking. bob rae of the liberal party called the comments inappropriate and inaccurate and alghabra described them as \"generalizing\" and \"divisive.\" the canadian arab federation accused baker of sowing division amongst canadians. an editorial in the toronto star asserted that israeli diplomats should not \"interfere in canadian affairs\".

by allowing reasonable public servants to do so when enforcing the spirit of the law. i work for a federal regulator, and the \"powers\" i have are absurd, because they allow for me to have a lot of leeway for catching corner cases where the spirit of the law is being broken. one of the first thing i was taught when joining this team was that if i really wanted to, the law lets me fine just about every company i visit for something if i look hard enough, but that would be stupid, and wouldn't be in service to canada. understand the spirit of the law, what it was meant to protect canadians from, and then use the regulations as a hammer to that end.

there are tons of people/firms breaking the rules set out in the act/regulations that i enforce, because the wordings are very open, but we don't go after them because it's not in the spirit of the law, and doesn't offer any benefit to canadians to do so.

there is no reason to assume that c-10 would be any different. the rules have to be \"strong\" otherwise smart lawyers will just loophole around them, and people like amazon and netflix have really smart lawyers. no one at the crtc is interested in actually going after small user generated content. but what about when that user grows and is no longer \"small\". that line is impossible to define, so the law must allow regulators some freedom.

a pretty core point which gets brushed over. guilbeault conflated any criticism of the government with undermining the government. you might say he was just trying to score political points of his own by trying to slander the ndp. which perhaps that was his sole intent, but i'm not keen to leave it to him to work out the details to his hearts content when that's the view he expressed on the floor of parliament. 

hard similarly to believe the author here who argues that she is in favor of freedom of speech but dismisses protection of freedom of speech as a matter of radical ideologues supporting misinformation and election interference.

in short if supporters of c-10 want it to be treated with support perhaps they should show some level of concern with the repeated attempts to put the fingers on the scale of public discourse. whether it's the liberals restricting campaign activities whole going on a whistle stop tour of campaign rallies themselves, or the cbc engaging in a slapp suit to keep the cpc from showing an excerpt of the national leaders conference, or as previously referenced guilbeault accusing the ndp of leading to an insurrection because they had the audacity to ask a question about conflicts of interest. if the lpc came at this with a view that freedom of expression actually mattered, it would be a different story, but then, they'd write a different bill.",liberals

that is the calculus at play.

some may call that dithering but it is strategic and all to get the michaels home, and trudeau has discussed with other nations to pressure china on many fronts to bring the michaels home.

it is an undeniable fact.

also, the liberal government has been 100% consistent on this matter going back years on the topic of human rights.

they have done it numerous times including calling out china with 39 other nations. that is how they will continue going forward, but trudeau won't label genocide until un inspectors go in, so don't expect it. expect much of the same and calling out human rights. trudeau seeks to avoid going that far for strategic reasons.",liberals

a firefighter going into a burning building risking their life to save someone is a display of courage.

they have a chance to succeed, and in doing so, would save a life. they are risking their life to do so, but will make a meaningful difference if they do, and it is not unreasonable to expect a non-trivial probability of success.

a person who doesn't know how to swim, jumping out of a ship during a hurricane at high seas because someone's family heirloom fell overboard is an idiot, because they'll certainly die, and there's little to gain, relatively speaking.

if china was, say, saudi arabia, or really just about any country except china and the us, then i'd say sure, let's call them out on it, and face the consequences. it would hurt us for sure, but we'd stand a chance at producing meaningful change for our sacrifice.

religion needs to be phased out, and we have been actively doing that for a few decades.

phasing out doesn't mean barbaric vain destruction of things that are already in place. that's why people who were already exercising authority for the state before bill 21 can keep their garments.

we absolutely need to prevent new stuff from being implemented, not replace anything.

i do support not letting catholic schools do whatever they want. they shouldn't be able to, say, discriminate or teach anything that contradicts science such as creationism or other nonsense.

we can steer holidays into new connotations, or bring them back to their pagan origin. i certainly would be in favour of phasing out \"jesus\" out of christmas, without deleting a nice holiday. we can bring back it's yule roots, keep presents, family time, santa and trees. it's a nice celebration of the winter solstice, and fairly easy to forget the religious parts.

it's a lot more realistic to proceed like this. it doesn't \"punish\" anyone, it doesn't crap on family traditions. it's widely celebrated by atheists, sikhs, etc who don't care about jesus.

for the same reason, renaming every damn town and street in québec would be completely unfeasible and would never be accepted. however i'd certainly support a ban against any new religious names for those. unless that person somehow was important to our society outside of their religious life. we could use their real name and keep the whole \"saint\" out of it. 

that's evolving. keep the good, flush out the bad. religion shouldnt be embedded in society.

it seems to be that agnosticism towards federalism (or outright hostility) is a common complaint about the ndp, in that they want what they want but don't like the constitutional realities that get in their way, so instead of figuring out ways to get to that point (like encouraging their supporters to campaign for provincial ndps) they act as though those issues aren't real and the lack of x policy coming forth is just a lack of *federal* liberal political will.",liberals

your complaining that harper did anything besides follow the recommendation of a committee established by a liberal pm is farcical and entertaining. i imagine that if he had not followed through on the liberal recommendation of creating the position the complaint from apologists in the lpc would be that harper doesn't want 1) to follow the suggestions of the lpc, or 2) he was trying to keep a lid on ethical breaches.  
  
the fact is, a investigation and report, initiated by the liberal government of the day, recommended that this position be established with the power to fine parliamentarians for their breaches in ethics, but more importantly, to provide clear guidance and direction to prevent ethical breaches in the first place.  
  
further, it *doesn't* treat an ethical breach as anything resembling a capital crime. the *maximum fine* is $500.00. unless you think murderers in canada are being fined under $500, your hyperbole is entirely of the mark. not one person went to jail over these ethical lapses, and most were not even fined the $500 limit.   
  
the framework you disparage *works*. that framework has even cleared trudeau of any wrong doing in the we scandal (although the manner in which he interfered in the investigation and failures to comply with officers of parliament was grossly unethical in and of itself). the system works, and yet you are advocating it be dismantled because *you* believe its definitions are too broad. a ludicrous assessment if ever there was one. t language of the federal accountability act (act) and the conflict of interest code (code) are positive rather than punitive, and are intended to guide people away from ethical lapses. the language and punishments are what they are because parliamentarians wanted to believe that this act wouldn't be violated often or ever, having just watched a government tumble under chretien as a result of the sponsorship scandal.   
  
as for claiming this isn't the proper venue, that \"the proper authorities\" should deal with the matter... the conflict of interest and ethics commissioner *is* the proper authority, created by the act passed by harper on the recommendations of the gomery report commissioned by martin.   
  
the office works, and worked for 9 years under harper where it was bounteous in providing all kinds of ammunition to the lpc, ndp, and bloc. now that the shoe is on the other foot, with trudeau et al. consistently being found guilty of ethical breaches, the need for it doesn't disappear. rather, the fact that this position and this office has found two consecutive elected parties to be in violation of the ethics of parliament simply demonstrates the need for an office like this.

it hasn't exploded though, its been slowly rising faster than wages for roughly 3 decades now. and many costs have gone down. computers and computing dirt cheap and half of our lives revolve around that now. food is still very cheap in canada. most of the increases have been in housing something that they dont have the power to solve without screwing over millions of canadians.

&gt;then to add risk, on top of everything else, they announce essentially zero interest in taming the housing bubble.

hm70a7p,2021-11-26T04:39:25.000-08:00,"we should begin using terms other than \"capitalism\" to describe economic liberalism there's a lot of pipeline issues. i guess transmountain sits in the imagination of easterners more than others because the federal government stepped in to buy it, thus saving it from immanent collapse. 🙄

the part that seems to get ignored of course is that the only reason it was at risk of collapse in the first place is because the liberals had created a hostile investment environment that chased away kinder morgan. it had nothing to do with the fundamentals of the project. so buying transmountain amounts to little more than an ass savings maneuver to a) keep them uppity westerners from up and leaving and probably more pressingly b) to show international investors that canada wasn't a place where you go to set your money on fire. as it is global investors like petronas have pulled out of canadian lng projects anyway.

far from being dead, kxl was under construction when it was unfairly terminated (now pending a $15b trade dispute that i'm sure the federal government will do nothing to aid). i'll grant that kxl's shortsighted cancellation by biden was probably not something the liberals had the power to overturn, but look at the way they're standing up for line 5, aluminum and anti-tariffs on evs. where was that outrage on our behalf? it looked like the government just shrugged and went, \"well we never cared about it in the first place.\" 830,000bbl/day x $60bbl x 365days is a hell of thing to shrug at, but it isn't always about results. sometimes it's about having tried. i look at engbridge's efforts to fight tooth and nail to keep service open for eastern canada on line 5 in sharp contrast to the liberals' indifference.

energy east was probably always a long shot and would have to get past quebec public opinion, but again there was no support for what should have been a true nation building project. ee would have allowed refineries in eastern canada to benefit from western canada's resource abundance by simultaneously allowing eastern canada to ween of foreign oil and become an exporter themselves.

the last and most egregious is obviously the northern gateway. this pipeline should be under construction right now and it has nothing to do with native opposition. as you see with transmountain and the coastalgas link, most native groups are actually in support of pipelines because they're means for jobs, services and royalty dollars to flow into remote under developed communities. there are a few vocal hold outs however and they steal all the press. just look at the unfolding wetsuwetn mess. most of the band is in favour of the project but a vocal minor clan is getting in the way and people are assuming they speak for the entire band. eventually just as tm and cgl, ng would have made it's way to the coast too.

no, the problem with norther gateway is that the liberals instituted bill c-48 which for no reason other than to be spiteful and prejudicial towards alberta specifically bans tankers from carrying bitumen off the stretch of the pacific coast where the terminal would be. never mind the fact that ships carrying bitumen currently leave the port of vancouver (for new brunswick among other destinations).

i know we were talking about trade obstruction, but i have to conclude by saying that these are the kinds of things that make people viscerally hate liberals in alberta. add in a long track record of bullshit like the cutting financing to farms during the depression and allowing the province to default, the nep and the other ongoing issues with equalization and bill c-69 (which people see as an infringement on provincial jurisdiction over natural resources) that are specifically meant to inhibit economic growth. it's no wonder why people want to leave canada. all it ever does is get in the way of our prosperity and overburden us with taxation for the courtesy of having done it.",liberals

some milk was dumped in bc during the road washouts because they were unable to physically transport the milk for processing. there was also milk dumped shortly after the initial covid lockdowns as there was a supply shock when literally every school and restaurant shut down overnight. these are outliers and by no means within the scope of normal operation.",liberals
