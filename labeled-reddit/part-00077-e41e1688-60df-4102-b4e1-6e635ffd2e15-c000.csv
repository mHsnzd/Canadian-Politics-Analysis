actually, nevermind. i figured it out.

you didn't mention that vacation flights and trips abroad are still 100% allowed to happen. i'm assuming you didn't mention it, because saying \"non-essential travel has been banned unless you're going to a sun destination or somewhere else on holiday. the border is more than open for that.\" probably wouldn't have suited your position that wanting to import fewer variants of concern was a bad position to take.

i going guess what you're going to say next. i'm going to guess that you'd say \"but canadians have a right to leave and enter the country!!!!!!!\"

and you'd be right. we do. 

what we don't have is the right to board a sunwing flight from mexico or air india flight from delhi or any other flight. that's not in the charter. if you think all canadians should have a guaranteed right to fly on a boeing 737 from sun destinations, write to your mp and request they reopen the constitution.

once a canadian is at a port of entry they need to be let in, but how they get to that port of entry when they decide to go on a cheeky pandemic holiday is entirely not my problem.

the point being made is that the relatively few cases of (potentially) racist incidents are being hyped, sensationalized, and exploited by both the media establishment and the political establishment for profit and electoral success.

as liberia-simp mentions quite accurately: the overwhelming majority of canadians know and acknowledge that racism is unacceptable. pandering to race politics for political gain is certainly a successful electoral strat, but it is still beating a dead horse. we've long moved away from a time when white supremacy was a mainstream or acceptable ideology. out current racial issues are now far more nuanced, and have more to do with poverty and high-crime neighbourhoods than they do with the colour of a person's skin. if we fail to acknowledge that, all of our solutions will be meaningless virtue signalling that doesn't actually accomplish anything.",conservatives

no, that's fine, i can see that, but then people with legit concerns have to make their voices heard apart from the conspiracy theorists. i do appreciate the difference.

they're saying, *empirically* that being anti-passport is going to have the same effects as being anti-vax, because of the people whom they find on their side of the issue. they should distance themselves, though if the media doesn't listen we're back at square one.

but you're putting them in legault's shoes, while i agree that more police interactions will lead to violence (it's unavoidable in any state activity), making that user answer for the injustice is the wrong way to go about it.

you're interrogating them, not inviting them to think of answers to the situation, what can be done to preempt or mitigate any regrettable violence. that's why i'm saying you're barking up the wrong tree.

&amp;#x200b;

if israel wants us to recognize that as their capital, they must restore full franchise and citizenship to the palestinians, guarantee them democracy and voting rights and human rights, pay them compensation for their stolen land, property and restitutions for the abuses they did to them.

second, the winning candidate is chosen by a complex process of preferential balloting and points distributed by electoral district. the winning strategy is to sign up small numbers of new members distributed throughout the country, and try to hit a bare plurality in enough districts to win the points race. a riding with a tiny cpc membership is worth just as much as central calgary.

 this is a trend that has been going on for a couple of years now relating to anti-asian crimes. it's \"white supremacy\". it's white people problem. it's the conservatives (trump's) fault. if one only reads national news stories, it is very easy to believe this propoganda. if you read into it however, the narrative starts to break apart.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/killing_of_vicha_ratanapakdee

edit: also the star article mentions an unethical but highly effective tactic of \"divide and conquer\". that is exactly what the modern left is doing. they take one group of people to appeal to (asian, black, women). they create a boogeyman (white supremacy). they advertise themselves as social justice advocates in order to get power. there is most definitely an anti-asian racism problem. however, after looking at **all** the cases of anti-asian crimes. it's clear that white supremacy is not the root cause of this.",conservatives

a few things that pop out immediately:

&gt;do the platforms support decreasing income taxes, and increase wealth taxes?

how does the ndp get 0 on this?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;do the platforms help canadians to earn money on things other than housing?

their analysis on this has nothing to do with their question. beyond being incredibly vague, they give the liberals points on something that doesn't even talk about allowing canadians to earn money, it just talks about using different metrics for measuring gdp.

&amp;#x200b;

some other things i've noticed:

* there's already about 96,000 renovations over 4 years budgeted by the federal government, unless the parties plan on taking explicit steps to pull that funding, it likely applies to all parties but only the liberals are getting points for it just because it's explicitly mentioned.
* the remaining \\~30,000 renovations and 20,000 new affordable homes promised by the liberals comes from an additional $2.7 billion they are adding to the national housing co-investment fund. they're getting points for that in this analysis, but the [pbo](https://distribution-a617274656661637473.pbo-dpb.ca/c14c97d8ca19d3036782918415de2bd3c976a66ed53e0030daf83b206c8d36e1) says that they're not spending half of what they've budgeted for over the last 3 years. i don't think we should be giving points to throwing more money at a pile of unspent money.
* other than the 20,000 homes from the previous point, they only commit to building 100,000 new homes in the liberal platform, making them the lowest offering on the supply side among the 3 parties.
* they give the liberals points for the first time homebuyers incentive despite saying that the platform waters it down. meanwhile, the liberals budgeted for 100,000 people to use the program and only [9,100](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-why-the-first-time-home-buyer-incentive-is-struggling-to-gain-traction/) people used it halfway into the program.

meanwhile, they give negative points to the ndp for giving money to first-time homebuyers, even though the liberals have the same policies (doubling first-time homebuyer tax credit). it's pretty nonsensical. the entire thing is riddled with issues along those lines.

lastly, it would seem reasonable to add something on the liberal record. the pbo report wasn't kind the the liberals and showed that they were meeting about half of their targets. it even highlighted a loss of 183,000 (42%) of low income social housing since 2015, yet they're getting points for talking about preserving housing.",liberals

&gt; scheer was a poor candidate, and high echelon members chose to back him including harper, even though he was bad for the party.

that is demonstrably untrue. the whole 'upper echelon' thing is a complete fabrication. sorry. bernier made his bed when he aligned with that shark from the states. he was high on my list till that happened and then i wanted nothing to do with him and i know many others who felt the same. if he'd done just a few things differently he'd have won. the only thing that caused him to fail was him. 

and harper stayed pretty damn neutral. as he should. 

&gt;i proposed a hypothetical where bernier won, i believe 2019 would have been a conservative minority, and a more conservative platform for said minority.

well of course you believe that. you're a supporter. whereas as a more detached observer can say with honesty that the evidence is otherwise. based on what we did see of him during that campaign, he is no better than scheer at running a campaign. and that's what did them in. he would have been easier for justin to smear than scheer was. so he'd have lost ground there. he lost his own seat in the east - which suggests his popularity there wasn't huge. so - there's no evidence at all to support the idea he'd have done better and a reasonable amount to say he wouldn't. 

it's not that he's a bad person. i've met with him, he's a good guy. and it's not that he has horrible ideas - most of them are decent. it's that he has no skill at politics. he does not work or play well with others. his ego leads him to bad decisions. he is inflexible and doesn't want to work towards things, he wants to get the things right now and if he can't he hissy fits.

prediction - i don't think he'll do well enough to turn the tide much. i think he may stop the slide, but i think that it won't be enough to give him momentum back in high enough levels to give him a victory. the format's just not great for it. 

he might surprise. he might get in a solid blow or three that exceeds expectation. but i think the flip flop put a serious torpedo in the trust levels of those who he needed to convince he was trustworthy and i don't think he'll be able to get that back in a debate,  and i think trudeau will pound on it  a bit tonite. 

it's a damn shame, he started off doing all the right things, definitely got up into victory territory and if he hadn't made that one mistake he probably would have built on that trust and wound up with a minority gov't, but in a short campaign you cannot afford even one mistake. 

fortunately trudeau's mistakes will prevent him from getting the majority he wanted as well. and he may very well have a much weakened minority, and that's going to cause him some internal party problems and limit his actions over the next few months, and with covid starting to go away a little if we have to go to a leadership convention then we can do it old school and maybe get that 'leadership bump' in the polls that new leaders usually do and ride that into the next election.",liberals

a great example of the liberals not being sincere is electoral reform. they needed to leech support from the then-leading ndp in 2015, so promised electoral reform. but when that process went sour from the system that favoured them most, they jettisoned the whole effort. that's the action of a pragmatic party focused on winning, not one with deeply held beliefs that wants to execute on them.

if downtown toronto was majority \"drill baby drill\", do you seriously believe the liberals would be limiting oil expansion?

my exposure to the party as a volunteer and member was that they would embrace whatever it took to win. sometimes thats necessary and pragmatic, but theres real danger of losing yourself in the process.

that's actually what my flair is about. i joined the party because i had some pretty sincerely held beliefs and values that based on the most recent election and general policy positions of the party, i believed the lpc shared. what i discovered when i was actually in the trenches is that the party's true mission at the time was \"we don't like harper, and want to be back in power. throw anything at the wall that sticks\". i can agree with the things that are thrown at the wall while still disliking the craven opportunism that led to those policies being proposed.

sure, but the liberals don't take their mandate from the average voter, they take their mandate from the liberal voters. asking them to consider all of canada is good, and they probably do that from time to time, but when talking about their mandate don't they receive it from their voters, not the entire voting population? 

the numbers don't lie, but the public is reactive. like leaving afghanistan what was trudeau supposed to do? 

the pandemic one really puzzles me, people are less confident in the healthcare system now rather than at the height of the pandemic, which just shows the public is probably being influenced by other factors: we see the usa floundering, our own confidence goes up. usa gets democrats back in power, while they may not be the best, they're not trump; canadian confidence falls cause we're always comparing ourselves to our bigger brother. 

the public isn't a great barometer, they do not exist in a vacuum where canada is the only country. i think americans actually getting back in the saddle will have a big impact on our self-image, for the worse because when trump was in charge canadians felt inflated. sure we have kenney and ford, but they're not trump, for all the pundits who compared them. 

it's not even anything the trudeau admin can wrestle with. the usa is stabilizing (i hope) and the golden age of \"there but for the grace of god go i\" is coming to an end. 

i don't think the liberals are going to take the oppositions voters in mind in creating their mandate, but the polling numbers don't exist in a vacuum either. a winter of discontent for the opposition, except the ndp was let in from the cold? i think the author forgot that with the ndps support the government won't be deadlocked like we see in the usa.

the usa might see a winter of discontent, which will of course bleed into canada, but their winter of discontent comes from the republicans feeling cheated and overexciteable and democrats feeling frustrated that they can't get anything done. canada will have a more functional government than the usa, people will grumble but what are they going to point at? trudeau isn't biden.",liberals

actually, the opposite is happening. the income difference between the riches at poorest in canada is the highest its ever been.

further, the current welfare system is set up such that it promotes people to abuse it. if you get a minimum wage job with welfare, you are automatically removed from the system. but often time, these jobs pay less than the system does. as such, staying on the system and staying unemployed is the better option for a lot of these people.

ubi could ironically be the answer to your argument about people taking government handouts because the reality is that a lot of those people are forced in that situation by the threat of having their welfare income taken away. a constant ubi, acting as an income floor, will support everyone but allow those who are willing to work harder to do so.",liberals

strategically keeping atwin and letting her maintain her position on the israel-palestine conflict is a good move. party policy is not going to shift away from a pro-israel position anytime soon but as public sympathy shifts away from israel and towards palestine it makes a whole lot of sense to keep a few token pro-palestinian mps around.

so when trudeau starts the comprehensive negotiations for childcare (which for the record is a good thing) all is fine and dandy, but when the ndp suggest we do the same for pharmacare, or head-to-healthcare more broadly the ndp is delusional and out to lunch? no double standard there at all that's for sure eh.

&gt;matthew green told jacobin (of course) that trudeau should have imposed the emergencies act. the words \"constitutional crisis\" are completely foreign to ndp fantasists. this is why they lose out in quebec and not because of singh's ethnicity. it was just last year that the bloc introduced a measure calling upon trudeau to condemn his own father for the controversial aftermath of implementing the act's predecessor, the war measures act. it was ugly and it was personal (and it arguably rode the coattails of the ndp and cpc's continued dirt-digging on margaret trudeau) and it even prompted certain western cpc mps to piggyback on blanchet's gross motion, demanding that he issue an apology for pet \"imposing\" the nep.

&gt;really, does the ndp not get how incendiary a move it would have been for a prime minister named trudeau to repeat history, not to mention with another nascent separatist movement in the making in alberta and the prairies? a qanon fanatic made an attempt on trudeau's life because he believed the pm to be a \"dictator\" and the ndp is upset that he doesn't live up to that meme?

just first the ndp is offering an alternative here, you obviously disagree with this alternative but literally this is the ndp offering an alternative course action when criticizing the government so doesn't exactly prove that the ndp is offering no alternative plan of action as the other poster was incorrectly claiming. 

doug ford did completely botch the handling of the third wave, and the initial vaccine rollout did see an unequal distribution of vaccine availability with richer neighborhoods having more, among other problems. [i'll just leave the letter jagmeet sent to the pm for others to judge if he was being unreasonable or not](https://www.ndp.ca/news/singh-trudeau-consider-emergencies-act-ontario).

can you name a policy the ndp wants that is constitutionally unworkable as you claim. take pharmacare, the ndp is proposing we use the exact same mechanism as exists presently with the canada health act, so clearly not unconstitutional. same for national standards for long-term care homes, implementing national standards through the canada health act. also could you potentially comment how it is a-ok when trudeau and the liberals implement a national program like childcare through negotiations with the provinces, but when the ndp proposes the same the ndp are just idiots who don't understand jurisdiction?

there are many good private software solutions for managing things like for family practices or hospitals. there are a few government ones, and even some open source ones. the biggest issue is that they often use things like proprietary file formats or different methods of information exchange. a hospital *may* be able to communicate with  doctors' offices or pharmacies electronically. it depends what software they have all decided to use. the problems pile up when their choice of software has no ability to exchange information with each other.

this is a common problem in tech-related industries. with a government-managed healthcare system, we should be able to make certain standards mandatory that fix a lot of these problems, and make software vendors communicate using things like common file formats.

&gt;sure, there's lots of privacy and security issues, but shouldn't i as an individual be able to sign off giving permission to use a slightly more risk system for all the benefits i can potentially get?

the exact same thing happened last year at the start of the george floyd protests, support for blm rocketed to all-time-highs. after a summer that included riots, the destruction of some businesses, and a crime increase that republicans have tried their hardest to link to calls to 'defund the police' support fell pretty dramatically.

in that case, the minute people thought the cost of change was a reduction in their safety (rightly or wrongly) support for that change fell. i worry if canadian's feel the cost of reconciliation will be born by higher taxes, lower spending, or even expropriation of property, support will fall quickly. it doesn't help that trudeau mostly talks about reconciliation in the world of the symbolic (flags lowered, days of commemoration announced).

reconciliation has the potential to create a much stronger federation, and provide alternative models of local governance. but i think canadian's will need to recognize that to right past *material* wrongs there must be some shared cost.",liberals

hdsyg5d,2021-09-21T13:36:35.000-07:00,"erin o'toole's fight to remain conservative leader has begun there are components of conservativism that i support.  

* right sized government - neither an invasive nanny state nor a libertarian micro-state.
* preeminence of individual rights and freedoms - this includes lawful/peaceful protests, offensive speech, non-traditional religious and cultural practices, right to privacy, due process, the right to identify oneself and protections against discrimination on racial/ gender/cultural basis, etc.  
* free markets - with regulation where needed to prevent market distortions and a stable banking and financial sector, to ensure essential (utility) services are available to rural canadians, to protect the environment and climate, etc.
* fiscal responsibility - government borrowing and spending are powerful economic levers.  too much public debt can be a massive weight on the economy that can take years to recover from, but austerity measures generally deepen and prolong recessions.   as i've mentioned earlier - when the economy needs stimulus, the poor and middle class who have little surplus are more likely to put that money to work in the economy than the wealthy.
* strategic investment - as we have seen, the loss of our pharmaceutical industry severely hampered our ability to respond to the pandemic.  some industries and capabilities are strategic - pharma, auto manufacturing, aerospace, shipbuilding, energy, biotech / medical, etc. need to be maintained - but we also have to be careful about corporate welfare and ensure that support for these industries server the public interest and doesn't just funnel public money to billionaires. 
*  national defense - a military sufficient to protect and defend our national interests and support our international mutual defense obligations.  i think our military is too small and our foreign policy and national defense priorities are too dependent on the us.  

some liberal values don't need to be at odds with conservatism.  if  conservatives took a longer term view of economic growth and sustainability they would all be environmentalists.   universal education and healthcare produce an educated, skilled and healthy workforce to support economic growth.  an economy that provides equal pay and opportunity for women and minorities is a larger, more robust and healthier economy.",conservatives

anyway, as for what the parties are asking for. the greens want a renewal of the cesb at 2000/month and some sort of residential tenant relief, the ndp want more federal involvement in the vaccine rollout and concrete steps towards a national childcare plan, the bq wants monthly support for seniors and no-strings-attached health transfers, and the tories want job creation and minimal taxation.  

for sure the greens will not be getting what they want. i doubt the bq will either because no federal government of any party is giving no-strings money and the tories ask for \"job creation\" is vague and could be interpreted as pretty much anything they wish.

and this is not the issue, the issue is whether or not it‚Äôs needed. the corporate media, the cpc, legault, the bloc, and business groups have done their best to push the narrative that crb is so generous that people would rather stay home on less than 1100 a month then work.

lots of people were working on crb, but earning less than half of their previous income, people who have spent their lives building careers in the arts, self-employed who are not getting enough work, etc, these are people who have already had to go through their savings because cerb was not enough, and now hundreds of thousands of people will be in crisis.

no numbers on the age or previous employment if crb recipients - i‚Äôd like to know just what sort of callous mindset actually thinks it is anything close to okay to cut a meagre benefit completely so tim hortons can make more billions on profit than they did last year.

great reset? the pandemic a chance to run the economy differently? more like the great doubling down on the status quo.

household income is expected to drop 4% and that is a conservative estimate, welfare rolls will balloon, food banks are already serving twice the number of people, lives will be ruined.

but hey, they‚Äôre raising the cap of pandemic aid to a million a month for service/accommodations industries, because 300,000 a month isn‚Äôt enough for a hotel chain.

it‚Äôs abhorrent in the extreme that while money is being shoved at both failing and successful industries (as stockholders and execs receiving bonuses can confirm), workers are being kicked to the curb, because timmy‚Äôs and the like needs workers!!! and apparently everyone on crb is a lazy good for nothing who didn‚Äôt have a career they trained and possibly had years of education for, and surely everyone in their fifties or sixties can stand on their feet all day earning less than half of what they used to earn.

it‚Äôs almost funny that the same media that dedicated endless pages to bullshit scandals so eagerly approves of cutting the crb.

for a global carbon tax to work, it would need to be collected on a global level, and cut every person on earth an equal monthly cheque. without that, while carbon taxes may be an excellent part of a national carbon strategy, they will remain unworkable in areas where the price difference would just hedge out whole communities from industrialization.",liberals

both english and french have equal status in the national assembly of quebec.

also, in the courts.

these rights were guaranteed in the bna act, which created the province of quebec.

but, in 1867, the sticky fingers of government weren't as pervasive as they are today.  for example, hospitals and social services were virtually all affairs funded and institutionalized in the private sector; today, government funds nearly 100% of it. so, no protections for minority english in quebec were considered for the bna act in this area.

and think of the crtc which governs radio and tv...and umpteen other manifestations of current technology. as pierre trudeau once pointed out: the fathers of confederation hadn't read jules verne and didn't realize the vast changes the future had in store for us. so no minority language protections were entrenched for the english in these areas in the bna act.

where government *was* active in 1867, there were ample protections provided for the minority language group.  but, alas, life has changed since then.

however, a safety valve was provided in the bna act: a veto power by the federal government which had, as one of its purposes, the protection of minority rights if and when provincial majorities abused those rights.  sadly, this power has not been used once since 1867 to protect provincial linguistic minorities whenever their rights were violated...be it in new brunswick in 1870, manitoba in 1896, ontario or saskatchewan or in quebec with bills 22, 101, 178, and, now, 96.",liberals

housing costs are an issue because of low interest rates which enable speculation, low wages among millennials, and zoning laws that make it difficult to replace single family homes with higher density multi family housing.  speculation is a problem because of low interest rates driving prices upward and low supply caused by zoning laws.

the easiest way to drop housing prices would be to let the interest rates rise high enough to start triggering foreclosures on the over extended speculators.  but doing that will fuck with general economic recovery and have huge collateral damage among over extended home owners.

changing the zoning laws requires action at the city and provincial level, but it will piss off the same home owners who spent $850,000 on an $300,000 home since they believe it would drive their property values downward.

but hey, blaming rich foreigners for a problem and going for a solution that attacks them is both politically expedient and politically effective.  so of course that is what will happen.

it's really only since early 2020 and the pandemic hitting in particular that it's become a national problem that would seriously require federal intervention. up until then they were basically letting the provinces deal with it and just doing what was in the easy federal purview for making first time buyer access easier.

ha76a1l,2021-08-24T05:22:29.000-07:00,"why mandatory voting is a success in some countries, but not embraced in canada &gt;this presumes that right now voters who turn up at the polls are educated and informed...which, i'm sad to say, is not always the case

it definitely seems that way, but the issue is that within democracy you can't discriminate against the \"uneducated\" because thats morally reprehensible and contradictory to the idea. i'm going off the assumption that given the option not to vote, more uneducated or uninterested voters will chose not to thereby slightly increasing the knowledge of the voter base artificially. 

&gt;if this is the metric, i think you need to probably disqualify 50%+ of the people who are currently voting. 

i know but again, odds are more likely for those currently voting to be generally more educated then those who aren't.

&gt;that being said, i'm not sure what the solution to this is. you can impress upon people the importance of voting, and even of being informed, but you can't always do much more than that.

no and thats the shitty part, a lot of people are just uninterested. i believe by introducing a ranked voting system could help as it gives more power to smaller parties which people may align with more, a current issue is a lot of voters who feel no party really represents them. i don't however believe that increasing voter turnout by any means necessary is gonna be an inherently good thing.

honestly, and this is gonna sound silly, i think we should introduce an element of entertainment to politics. bring the satire rhino party front and center and let them do some antics, have mp's and party leaders engage in charity competitions like when trudeau boxed a senator in 2012. people still wont care as much, but it'll get people talking.",liberals

i see the logic, given the rise of telework, but supposedly these conversions are easier said than done. it's telling that the private sector does relatively little of this.

housing must not become a commodity to be speculated upon and traded among the wealthy. they are dwellings, and i want assurances from our candidates that they're going to take aggressive action to reverse the current trend.

needless to say, i'll be in contact with my mp again to ask for an explanation why they felt the proposed ban and the way they presented it to me would be a satisfactory solution when it barely addressed the matter.",liberals

the \"private health care\" mentioned in the headline is _not_ clinics that operate on a for-profit basis but collect only provincially-regulated fees (for covered services) through the public health-care system.  this is almost universal in canada, and it is aggressively uncontroversial.

instead, the article discusses separate, _user-pay_ delivery of health care.

the leading example mentioned in the article is [saskatchewan's](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/health/accessing-health-care-services/medical-imaging/procedures/magnetic-resonance-imaging-exam#private-pay-mri) private mri system.  in that province, patients with money can pay private firms for medically-necessary mris, and in exchange said private firms will also accept public patients on a one-for-one basis.

this system expressly incorporates user fees for faster access to medically-necessary care.  you may or may not think this a good thing, but it is something different than the common image of canadian health care.",conservatives
