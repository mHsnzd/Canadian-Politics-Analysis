&gt;the sites host some of the tens of thousands of inactive wells in alberta. many of these dormant wells are owned by companies facing serious financial difficulties and at risk of going bankrupt, according to internal briefing notes.

https://globalnews.ca/news/7522916/orphan-wells-coronavirus-oilpatch/

the owa reports 7000-8000 sites (wellbores and others) either waiting for or in process of decommissioning.

https://www.orphanwell.ca/about/orphan-inventory/

what isn't known is the number of wells owned by companies about to go bankrupt or simply functioning as zombie holding companies, stripped of assets and no longer even paying out to landowners. as the article estimates, there are potentially tens of thousands of them.

it's very likely that the problem is very much bigger than the official numbers indicate. that 90,000 number is a worst case, but not an unfeasible worst case by any imagination.

this holding of wells inactive by not closed by zombie companies is a regulatory failure on the part of alberta. it's one of the very few places that allows non-producing wells to be kept on the books for years, even decades. in north dakota, for example, a well must be decommissioned after three months. crazy long decommissioning times is a huge hidden subsidy for alberta o&amp;g.",liberals

we could stop mining coal, shut down oil and gas, hire another 40k public sector workers and pay them the highest in the country, but we know that will bankrupt the country.

&gt; other interesting findings are that rachel notley's ndp are basically \"liberals\"

the alberta liberals had historically been the opposition to the pcs. however, by 2015 the party had languished under the leadership of former pc mla raj sherman (good campaigner, horrible leader), and then sherman dropped out six months before the election, forcing the party to pick an interm leader to carry the party into the election, supported by empty coffers and a demotivated base.

likewise, the right-wing wildrose party--which nearly unseated the pcs in 2012 before the pcs swung left and cannibalized a tonne of progressive votes from the liberals--had also collapsed, as half their entire caucus, *including their leader, danielle smith*, had defected to the pcs just months before the election.

so, in 2015, with both his major rivals headless and flailing, jim prentice called a snap election...

and proceeded to bungle it so bad that the ndp, the only party being competently run at that point, ended up winning a surprise victory.

after notley won, pretty much all the progressives who used to support the liberals or the alberta party moved over to the ndp, since they finally had a shot at power. but, really, the ndp only got in by accident--even notley was expecting a narrow pc victory, probably a minority, right before the election.",liberals

my issue is the divisive nature of it all. instead of calling a spade a spade and moving on, we're more interested in holding feet to the fire even when cpc members may even be signaling a shift in perspective. in short, we need to give people the room to change and (however naive) extend that room to do so and believe it as genuine. what is the point of changing if everyone will forever hold you to your past while refusing to acknowledge the present/future? it's incredibly hard for the average person to admit wrong on issues such as these. accountability is important but defining an entire base by their outliers is wholly unhelpful when we fundamentally understand (if we're being honest) that not everyone is an islamaphobe. every party is more nuanced than that but for some reason, we continue to choose division over education and openness.

&gt;au moins, ça change pas grand chose. c'est 6 libéraux et 4 conservateurs. higgs avait cessé de se battre contre la taxe sur le carbone après les résultats de 2019, constatant que la majorité du nb avait voté pour des partis pro taxe sur le carbone. avec 42% de vote plc contre 34% pcc ( 38% plc et 33% pcc en 2019 ), le vote populaire reste assez stable pour les deux grands partis. ça forcera peut-être higgs à signer une entente avec trudeau pour les garderies (come on, même la saskatchewan l'a faite). 

jʼespère quʼottawa va lâcher lʼidée dʼune taxe carbone au québec parce quʼon se ramasse à se battre côte à côte avec lʼouest. on a déjà un marché du carbone avec la californie et ce serait mieux de lʼétendre que de lʼétouffer. 

jʼai lu sur le sous-reddit des verts que annamie paul est complètement opposée aux marchés de carbone, c'est taxes ou rien. je ne la comprends pas. bonne chance avec la reconstruction.",liberals

h3lhbqs,2021-06-30T05:33:04.000-07:00,"conservative support dips as liberals appear on steady road to majority: poll the left-right economic spectrum simply describes whether you believe the workers or private owners should own and manage the means of production. we examine the platforms of various parties to see if their policies would move the balance of power toward workers or towards capital.

as an example: the gpc supports allowing sex workers to control their working conditions (a leftwards position) while the cpc passed c-36 in 2014 which removed sex workers' control of their working environments as they could no longer work indoors.

another example: the gpc supports a guaranteed livable income (gli). the gli would provide a floor so that people couldn't be forced (by rent, food, etc.) to work jobs with poor pay or terrible working conditions. instead capitalists would be forced to offer a better wage or improve working conditions to entice wokers. this would help shift the balance of power back towards workers and thus is a leftwards position.

obviously this is a big spectrum with many policies and positions along it. despite offering the above it would be a mistake to think of the gpc itself as 'leftist' or far-left. their leader is still a capitalist, and even the eco-socialists in their ranks don't advocate for the workers seizing the means of production (which is the probably the quintessential leftist position).",liberals

ontario: lpc+15 (!) over the cpc. in 2019, they were +8 over the cpc

quebec: lpc+6 over the bloc, with cpc-ndp-gpc support falling further

bc: lpc+10 over the ndp, the cpc in third with only 23%. in 2019, the cpc won bc by 8pts over the lpc so this would be a huge swing.

atlantic: lpc +21 over the cpc, up from around +12 in 2019. not that significant though because the liberals already have most seats and can't gain much more.

alberta: cpc+9 over the lpc, down from +55 in 2019.

sask/man: cpc+18 over the lpc, down from around +34 in 2019.

the last two, especially with alberta, should be taken with a grain of salt. i don't doubt that the cpc is collapsing there, but it's hard to imagine such a dramatic increase in support for the liberals, more than doubling their 2019 share. still, winning a handful of seats in edmonton and calgary and cleaning up in winnipeg looks realistic for the lpc, and the ndp has a shot at more urban seats too.

now demographics:

women: lpc+15 over the ndp, with the cpc at a miserable 22%.

men: lpc+7 over the cpc. tories need to win the male vote to have any shot.

18-34: lpc+8 over the ndp

35-54: lpc+13 over the cpc

55+: lpc+11 over the cpc.

in other words, the liberals are ahead everywhere in canada except for alberta and the sask/man bloc (even then, they might be ahead in manitoba or at least very close). the liberals are ahead with both men and women, and every age group from zoomers to boomers favours the liberals.

these are majority numbers. the liberals' biggest worry now is the \"strategic/abc vote\" softening up, because if the cpc look way out of even contending for power, the message of \"you have to vote for us to keep the tories out\" doesn't really work. but it's just so genuinely hard to see any scenario in which the liberals don't win an election that gets held in 2021.

remember, a 12 point lead over your main rival (as this poll is suggesting) is a blowout in canada. last time that happened was when chretien's lpc got a 15-point popular vote advantage over the canadian alliance in 2000, and this probably only happened because of a right-wing vote split.",liberals

when translating from one language to another, it's not uncommon for the translator to 'rework' aspects of what they're translating to fit the language/culture it's being translated into. for example, idioms might need to be changed because the exact translation doesn't make sense. voldemort's name is actually a rare example (i think) of a character name being reworked for multiple cultures because the name is partly derived from voldemort's birth name.

well, it's the principle of how intersecting interests work. eventually individuals try to find in groups again. so you aren't wrong on conservatives needing to make use of this. but that again there in is the problem in it all.

a properly operating democracy requires that all parties with voting agency (i.e you and i) are all thinking as individuals and not as groups. this way a more proper representative answer is given at the booth.

when everyone plays party politics, everyone loses. and since individualism itself just results in it inverting upon itself again and again; it's really just a bandaid solution to the problem.

we need to be rid of party politics all together and work based on policies instead.

i'm not quite sure how best to manage that part, but essentially elections would be very interesting to figure out how best to operate them without there being 'parties' involved. candidate leaders would need to be selected via a prior vote to then be chosen between, or something like that. and it would have to remain a mass referendum system, without any potential for planted candidates, etc.

not to mention we currently have almost no actual statistics being touted, nor available for public or government use / consultation as far as i know relating to the source of firearms used in crimes. i know this is a topic that anyone who doesn't own a firearm doesn't actually care about, and its a very narrow subsection of the canadian population, but it's just poor policy making, and that alone should be the reason why this attempt should be more widely criticized.

for those who own firearms, it's frustrating to see arbitrary programs aimed at them with no statistics to back up punishing them over it, and for those who rightfully want to see less firearm-related crime in canada, it should be frustrating that this will ultimately change nothing in the consistency or availability of firearms in the country, as from what little information we do have about gun crime, most of them are smuggled from the gun-soaked state south of us that we share the longest undefended and porous border in the world with.",liberals

we have an estimated 12.7 million+ guns in canada and estimated 3 million pal/rpal card holders. average value of a firearm in canada is estimated at $500-600 +taxes, assuming 100% compliance would cost closer to $6-7 billion.

what is your reasoning for believing that canada’s current abortion laws, which recognize personhood at birth, are acceptable?

i believe our current system to be the most fair for everyone. those who want an abortion can have one based on their own morals. those who disapprove of abortion don’t have to have one. don’t know why i have to repeat myself.

many people disagree with when personhood begins, but i’d say there pretty close to a consensus that if a baby is killed once it is out of the womb, that is clearly murder. so i don’t think it’s fair for a politician to arbitrarily draw a line in the sand at a certain point that limits the freedom of other established members of our society under law to do what they wish with their bodies. having personhood recognized at birth ensures all people of differing beliefs have as much freedom as possible when it comes to abortion. 

**simply put, i value as much freedom as possible for all members of society, as long as they are not harming anyone else or limiting someone else’s freedom to practice ones own social beliefs under law. recognizing personhood at birth ensures women can have an abortion when they see fit, and those who are morally against it can choose not to have the procedure**",conservatives

macron's government (and all the governments before him), to hide its failures, takes any opportunity to denigrate muslims. 

and i know that quebec is closer to france than the rest of canada.

moreover, what i know is that you don't know the difference between secularism and neutrality. in france, the 1905 law allows the separation of the church (and by extention all religious institutions) from the state, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the state. moreover, it is well mentioned that each citizen (public agent or not) is free to exercise his religion in public and in private. the law of 1905 is in this sense perfect since it defines secularism. all the laws that came after the law of 1905 were created to force neutrality in society. 

so all the debates about wearing religious signs in the functions of the state are sterile since according to the law of 1905 it is allowed.

certain muslims and sikhs can't not wear their symbols according to their religion. they would be impacted more than most, by a huge margin.  they couldn't become teachers, lawyers etc. while maintaining their faith. 

to argue it impacts every religious person equally is disingenuous.  people talk about \"dog whistles\" all the time here and the dog whistle here is that quebec doesn't want muslims or sikhs and don't want to see funny looking people in turbans or hijabs.

check out the green party pages on facebook and reddit - revolt. last night there was an emergency grassroots members meeting with almost 100 people in attendance (not much) but their wasn't a single good thing said about paul during the 2+ hour discussion. 

you can stay and fight for the party, but you may very well lose your seat - and there is no guarantee you can stop may, paul and other very hierarchical uber-control types from thinking they can grow the party with the same old top-down boomer style.

for example, what if a judge was an outspoken catholic? doesn’t that also create potential for the appearance of bias? religious symbolism is not the only way that the religious beliefs of those in power can be made known. if you really want to eliminate the appearance of bias you would have to completely remove the religious practices of those in power from the public eye. that means no going to church either.

also, why should we assume that religious symbolism even creates the appearance of bias? i would argue that anyone who assumes someone is biased based on their religious apparel is a bigot; that is, unless there is evidence that bias actually exists. and if you need additional evidence unrelated to the religious symbolism to reasonably believe that someone is biased, why should religious symbolism be banned? that just seems like quebec is catering to unreasonable people and bigots.

this is all predicated on the idea that this is a good faith argument from those who support the bill; it's not. you can argue all you want about how \"equally\" it targets all religions, but it doesn't. there are only a few religions that currently require religious garb. if you actually try to argue that catholics in quebec will be just as affected as muslims then you're full of shit. anyone who followed the politics leading up to this bill as well as the political climate in quebec can tell that it was clearly targeted. either you are extremely dense or you are just lying.

that said, in any case, the reality of where this attack comes from is more complex than one law, especially in a free society. most of these attacks stem from online radicalization. men feeling driftless and isolated, feeling reaffirmed for the first time in their lives by visiting the wrong internet forum, and then spiralling into an ideological wormhole separated from reality. some people want to police ideas, but i think that's impossible, personally. really the social isolation of men (this sounds like i'm saying women have to date them, they don't) has to be addressed.",liberals

the naci plays a vital role in collecting and analyzing data, assessing risk, and providing recommendations for vaccine administration in canada. 

as far as i've seen, their core role has been professionally executed. vaccines have been assessed and recommendations have been released to the provinces following a precautionary-principle mandate.

the problem is the naci making statements and recommendations on the level of individual canadians. it is not the role of the naci to try and educate canadians on the statistics behind their work, or the nuance of their risk assessments. 

it is absolutely harmful to have naci saying one thing to provinces and another to the general population. if the vaccines are safe enough to be recommended for use for age x, then thats it. there should not be a second caveat at the level of individuals to vaccine shop based on *what potential vaccine recievers think of the risk in there local area*. if someone is worried, that's a conversation to have with a physician who has access to their health history, not a generalized national television broadcast.

should we tear down our historical figures, especially the important ones? i don't think so, but we definitely have to bring them down to earth and talk about the real them too.


i find people in this country try to turn john a into a washingtonian-like or jeffersonian-like figure when he wasn't. i also find that a lot of the history surrounding confederation also seems to focus heavily on him, at the expense of canada's other fathers of confederation. it would be like talking about the 1990s and omitting stephen harper, lucien bouchard, paul martin, and the list goes on, and instead building this folkloric type narrative around jean chrétien. we already kinda see this happen with pierre elliott trudeau, and i find that regrettable.

i agree that this was a very instructive episode. it was fascinating how the increase in the top marginal rate didn't really provoke much resistance, while relatively obscure tax changes ignited quite a lot. perhaps, it is revealing as to where the real money is! either way, this was a significant tactical misstep on the liberal's part.

however, let me suggest an alternative interpretation of those events. there really is a populist demand for higher taxes on the rich. this is borne out by countless polls and trudeau's own successful 2015 campaign promise. but the tax treatment of small businesses is an obscure part of this that people don't really understand, and this allowed the narrow, wealthy group of people who it affects to mount a significant campaign of resistance. a better approach might have been to wrap this up with a broader, more aggressive crackdown on tax evasion - for example the government could have loudly proclaimed it was going after the panama papers cheats, while including these reforms as part of the package. but it's hard to imagine bill morneau taking this approach, not least because he himself was linked to the panama papers!

the lesson to me here is that you need to intentionally pick the fight, rather than trying to pull on over on the rich. the wealthy know where their money is and the policies that affect them. they will fiercely resist any real attempt at taxation. politicians need to anticipate this and make sure to set the debate in such a way that they are taking on the 1%. morneau really was doing this, in this case, but nobody *knew* that because he didn't frame it that way (and his personal circumstances certainly didn't help).

&gt;i was thinking more along the lines of marking home equity to market and  assessing the gain or loss as realized income.  that's exactly what  would happen with a global wealth tax above a certain threshold.

i mean, wealth tax is literally like property tax (except for being progressive according to net wealth). it's not a form of income tax that is levied on gains. so i'm not sure what point you are trying to make here.

&gt;that can explain voters – we're all the weird ones here in that we spend  more than five minutes a week thinking about politics – but it doesn't  really explain the liberal youth wing that is the source of these  policies.

fair enough. i was thinking of the average voter and i don't really know what to make of the liberal youth wing tbh. maybe you have a better sense of how they see things. it's a source of confusion for me, frankly.

&gt;oh, they'd know the difference.  the opposition and associated lobby  groups would spend barrels of ink on how the government wanted to tax  \"the hard work of canadians,\" how the evil liberals want to take away  your benefits, and how pharmacare is really a way to take grandma's  medication out of her mouth (by over-stretching any restriction such as  default-generic substitution, or non-coverage for experimental drugs).

i really just don't think this is true. the bc ndp replaced the msp premium with an employer-side payroll tax and it was fine. some grumbling here and there, but overall immensely popular.

edit: in case you aren't familiar with msp, in bc people paid an insurance premium ($75 per month) for healthcare coverage. most employers covered this fee as a benefit, but low-wage and contract workers often had to pay it themselves. so it was extremely similar to the drug coverage situation.",liberals

you can thank jack layton for that. it's really amazing the amount of people who praise layton as the best thing to ever happen to the ndp, then basically shit all over the party for the things he did/started. 

&gt; the \"he pushed me incident\" in the house of commons.

did he say this? i know lots of people were mad that he wasn't like sobbing and talking about how bad the ndp did on election night but i don't recall him saying they had an \"amazing\" result. 

&gt; while jagmeet just comes across as.. fake.

i disagree with this. i actually think he comes off as the most genuine of the party leaders. he definitely knows how to use social media the best.  

&gt; the general \"hey it's my idea and the liberals/greens stole it\" . as long as the idea is good and goes forward, that's what i care about. just because you thought about it, doesn't mean it's your exclusive right to it.

what i see in marc garneau, is the depth that every politician tries to convince you is just under the surface, actually is under the surface for him. actually having heard him speak on a number of occasions i get that he’s not everyones cup of tea but i like him. he reminds me of george rr martin describing the difference between himself and jrr tolkien “most of us fantasy writers build worlds in a way that tricks the reader. it is like we have images look like icebergs but are really a block of ice floating floating on a raft, tolkien had the entire iceberg beneath the surface”. people can quibble about his charisma in the same way literary critics use tolkienesque to describe needlessly dense or derivative writing styles, but the depth of his policy wonk-ness  is similar to the depth of tolkien’s imagined world.

i would argue with your assertion of “ pretty typical of what happens when engineers...” since i have met a lot of engineers in my life... very few of them are well-read, particularly the ones who go into politics, let alone few are wel read enough that they can off-the-cuff invoke literature the way i have seen garneau do it. but, again i’m a wonky weirdo...",liberals

one of the best ways to counter islamophobia is to have people of muslim origin as teachers, police officers and politicians. bill 21 essentially eliminates the participation of muslims in these fields.

take william nordhaus, winner of the 2018 \"nobel prize in economics\" (actually the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel. there is no actual nobel prize in economics, but i digress.) he won the prize for a paper that ostensibly \"integrates climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis.\" i'll link you to a summary below:

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856

in short, nordhaus assumes that since 90% of economic activity takes place indoors, 90% of economic activity will therefore be unaffected by climate change. 

even more egregiously, he makes a spurious connection between temperature and gdp derived from gdp differences between hotter and colder countries: equatorial countries tend to be poorer, northern countries tend to be hotter, and so you can calculate the economic harm from global warming by multiplying this factor by the expected temperature increase. he refers to this as \"empiricism.\"

that's right. he didn't take into account flooding, forest fires, deadly heatwaves, crop failures, or drought. he just compared the average gdp of hot and cold countries and used that factor to project economic losses from climate change. he then compared that with possible economic damage from climate change mitigation to find the optimal level of warming we should be aiming for. he won the \"nobel prize\" for this.

h9pbm6q,2021-08-20T05:53:44.000-07:00,"conservatives' housing plan includes a two-year trial ban on foreign buyers while i'm generally a conservative supporter, this is the worst kind of populist policy.

the problem with canda's housing market is not foreign buyers. the only city that has ever had a real foreign buyer problem is vancouver, and that issue no longer drives the vancouver market since the introduction of the vacancy tax.

the problem with canada's housing market is that local regulatory and tax burdens make it very difficult to build housing, and outright impossible to build the kind of housing we need most - namely medium density housing.

here in toronto, you will face just as much regulatory opposition trying to build a medium density 8-unit building as you would if you were building a 40 story glass box monstrosity. the inevitable result of this is that developers only build massive buildings, since they can at least spread the regulatory and tax costs over many units.

and it's not just toronto or vancouver; these nimby barriers are a huge issue throughout the country. there is a cottage in my maternal family north of victoria, so i've been a member of a local community group on facebook for a while. saanich - the municipality north of victoria - is updating its growth plan for more density and housing, and a *huge* amount of commentary in that group is in outright opposition to the idea that the housing supply should be expanded at all. ruins the \"rural character\" of the area.

we don't need less foreign buyers. we need to use legislation to remove the ability of municipalities to prevent the development of new housing. of course, this is wildly unpopular - i recall this sub being mostly against doug ford when he overrode local development restrictions in areas adjacent to mass transit. everyone wants more housing and density - as long as it's somewhere else.

the only city i've seen that's doing this right is ottawa, where you are allowed to develop anything up to an 8 unit building by right throughout almost the entire city. this is exactly what we need, but the nimby concerns in other places are too strong to allow that kind of measure to pass.

so instead of the real solutions, we blame a bogeyman that has never been the problem. this is a bipartisan issue. homeowners vote, so the nimby streak in our politics runs straight through from the municipal level to the federal parliament.",conservatives

2. the thing about setting up a canadian corporation is that if you want to qualify for a loan the corporation needs to provide 2-years of operating financials to be able to use the company’s income. 

3. if these foreigners want to purchase a property using a newly setup canadian company in less than 2-years then sure they could do it but the only banks that would look at them would be private lenders and they would likely pay a 2% fee in the loaned funds and the interest rate would easily 6.5-10%. this would be a huge deterrent for foreigners.

yes. when your asset appreciates by $160k, you pay capital gains on that gain for any other asset, and the home should be the same. the person only pays taxes when they sell. these tax rates are not high - capital gains top out at 26.76% if you make &gt;$220k per year.

i also find land transfer taxes gross, they are one of the many ways municipalities have shifted their tax burden away from existing homeowners towards people who want to move to the city. it's a huge part of the housing crisis - rather than using the property tax base to fund the municipality, many places use transfer taxes and development fees to reduce property taxes. for obvious reasons, this is a political winner given that your voters mostly already live in the city.

but the existence of land transfer taxes isn't an argument against capital gains taxes. to reverse your question: why should one single capital asset be entirely tax-free when every other asset attracts capital gains taxes? why should someone who chooses to rent and invest their money in the markets be subject to capital gains taxes when homeowners are not?

i truly do not understand how the conservative party can both have nothing to stand on with their at attempts at scandals or gotcha moments while also getting away with it for their base. it’s like watching a kid refuse to open his eyes while swinging in a tball game.

there are many things the pm might (heavy emphasis on that might word for me) have been able to do to ease messaging, or remove uncertainty, i’d even put a ding on his record for not taking control of the province’s for their bs (but that’s me personal being biased under doug fords “leadership”), but i’m with you in i’m not sure what people really or truly expect could have been done.",conservatives
gyy1kh2,2021-05-21T00:13:57.000-07:00,"think regulating user generated content in bill c-10 is just an inadvertent mistake? think again - michael geist &gt;i mean, you're not correct here. these services were not able to be regulated as broadcasters before. this is a new power.

i am correct. the 1991 [broadcasting act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/b-9.01/) is intentionally technologically neutral, and the crtc, which is legally competent to interpret and apply the act, and which has been given significant deference by the courts in doing so, up to and including the supreme court of canada, [determined in 1999 that audio and audiovisual programming counted as “broadcasting”](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1999/pb99-84.htm) under the definition in the act. this ruling has never been challenged or overturned by any court. the crtc then [exempted](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-409.htm) such content from regulation, subject to a very few provisions that have never been meaningfully applied.

it’s a simple fact. the crtc has had jurisdiction over audio and audiovisual content on the internet since such content existed. c-10 does not create a new power, and while its intention is to meaningfully extend regulation on the internet where the crtc has refrained from doing so in the past, it actually *limits* the theoretical power the crtc has now, both under c-10 as tabled and as amended (by the liberals) at committee.

&gt;sure, assuming you're licensed as a news and public affairs program, which doesn't apply to any youtube channels now, and they're not about to start licensing every 50k channel out there.

i don’t know what this means. c-10 explicitly states that online undertakings won’t be “licensed”. and if you’re claiming that they won’t, as a practical matter, regulate 50,000 channels, then you’re making my point that the crtc is not going to take a maximalist approach to regulation.

&gt;when the government says that some content has to move to the front page, and some stuff has to move to d-17, that's a form of censorship. like, 100%.

again, you keep assuming certain details and specifics—“the front page”, “d-17”?—which are not in the bill, and are not citing your sources for where this is supposed to come from. conservative mp rachel harder, who has been flown in to the heritage committee to disrupt it, has done what you’ve been doing, and the non-political bureaucrats tasked with assisting the committee’s work have repeatedly told her that she shouldn’t be presuming those things because they’re not in the bill and won’t necessarily be how it will work.

&gt;and the bill explicitly says it's going to give the crtc this power and this mandate.

again, the power, but not the mandate. you—and geist, and many other critics of the bill—keep claiming or assuming that the crtc will take a maximalist approach to regulation. it’s like saying that because a police officer takes a gun and 40 rounds out on patrol each day, that they will shoot 40 people before they finish their shift. “why give them the power if they’re not supposed to use it?” it’s patently obvious in that case how absurd that statement is, it’s just that most people are more familiar with how cops operate than how the crtc does.

section 5(2)(h) of the new act would direct the crtc to take into account the variety of undertakings covered under the act, including online undertakings by definition, and “avoid imposing obligations on any class of broadcasting undertakings if that imposition will not contribute in a material manner to the implementation of the broadcasting policy.” c-10 specifically instructs the crtc to *avoid* regulation unless it has to. i’m citing you the specific section now. you can look it up. your claim that the crtc has some kind of maximalist mandate to regulate everything on the internet is simply wrong, and the history i’ve now cited showing it avoiding internet regulation for decades demonstrates their tentativeness in practice.

&gt;repetition isn't the problem. truth is.

i agree. you don’t understand the truth, which is why i’ve had to keep repeating it.",liberals

and i dunno, it mind of makes sense to me that the feds collect the majority of the taxes, it makes sense to me that its centralized and done once rather than have each province effectively have a cra. as long as the province's share gets divided out fairly, it is a potentially more efficient system.  i personally think the way the us handles it is insane. not that we couldn't do much better.",liberals

gx40uxc,2021-05-05T13:39:52.000-07:00,"liberal budget underestimates size of federal deficits, will lead to decades of higher debt: pbo when factoring in the sustainability of canada's debt, it's important to factor in both prolonged spending practices and growth of debt servicing costs relative to the budget. currently we're not in a horrible budgetary situation, our debt levels are comparable to most oecd countries, our debt servicing costs are currently sustainable and our credit rating hasn't been downgraded.

in the short term, high deficits are sustainable, the concern though is long-term budgetary practices going into the next couple of decades. in 2019 debt servicing costs are only around 5.5% of the federal budget and 1% of gdp compared to the early 90s when they made up around 30-40% of the budget and 6% of gdp (operating budgets had been balanced between 1987-1996, but pierre trudeau era debt servicing costs were so high that they imposed heavy debts on the federal government even when those governments incurred no debt of their own for over a decade and ate away at federal program spending in multiple areas).

so generally the federal government has room to incur some more debt without debt servicing costs really making that big of an impact or increasing significantly. though at the same time that generally shouldn't fuel complacency in regards to long term spending outlook since decades of large deficits could put us in a similar position to the early 90s again. if debt servicing costs were to double to 11%  of the budget by 2025-2030 that would be taking a much more noticeable bite out of federal program expenditure and reduce the money going to other services etc.  so generally if overall spending as a percentage of gdp is going to be maintained at a certain level over a prolonged period of time, eventually revenues should either be raised to meet them, or spending should be lowered to line up with revenues.",liberals

i do think it's good to have a well-educated, accomplished leader if possible, ideally someone with experience working on big issues and being in a role with real responsibilities.  so those are strong points for carney.

i think the issue is that some people from educated/elite circles are good at communicating and relating to ordinary people or seeming authentic, while others really lack that ability.  that's an important quality in politics, and it's a big unknown until you see someone in the political arena.

so i do think it would ideally be good to see how carney fares as an mp and/or cabinet minister first, before selecting him as party leader an pm.  partly to see if he's a good fit, and also to make sure he gets well-steeped in current/recent canadian political issues, after some time away.

the good news is that he wasn't away for nearly as long as ignatieff, which i think was a more legitimate concern (since ignatieff was living elsewhere for most of his adult life).

on a related note, i just saw someone on twitter posted an article from 2009 where ignatieff was asked to list his \"10 favourite things he can't live without\".  it includes tolstoy, pianist alfred brendel, and the opera...  i appreciate his honesty, but it's probably not the most relatable list.
