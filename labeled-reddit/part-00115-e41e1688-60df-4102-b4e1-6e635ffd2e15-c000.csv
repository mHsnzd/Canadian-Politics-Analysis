1)100 new cbsa agents ($69,000 year) to combat border smuggling, 20 at each of the 5 busiest points of entry.  
  
2) 100 new rcmp officers ($97,000) to combat gang crime nation wide, divided into 5 regional task forces.   
  
3) and that amount leaves another 58.4 million to spend on community outreach, local police and anti-gang initiatives, and of course, desperately needed mental health support...  
  
*and it could provide all of those things every year for a decade.*  
  
instead, this government is (yet again) violating people's charter rights, based on an objective lie, and pissing away $750 million.  
  
and that, ladies and gents, is if the government fucks people by under representing the true value of the firearms they want to buy back. the true value of these firearms and the true value of the buyback could easily triple the amount of money we end up spending. money we could spend on actually combating violent crime in this country.  
  
ps before you all decide to jump in with \"section one of the charter says...\"  
  
it also says any restrictions must be \"...subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be *demonstrably justified* in a free and democratic society\" which the court has already ruled requires that laws be based on factually correct arguments. nothing in this order in council is based on fact. it is doomed to failure in court. and the first time a conservative government is elected, it is doomed to be repealed, regardless of outcome before any level of the courts.

h3it862,2021-06-29T13:46:34.000-07:00,"liberals say by 2035 all new cars, light-duty trucks sold in canada will be electric i don't know where people get this idea that the electrical grid is constantly on the verge of overload. since you specifically said 'overnight' - that's *exactly* when the electrical grid has a *lot* of spare capacity - in some places the wholesale price of electricity becomes negative at night because they have to dump that excess electricity somewhere to not overload things. between 12am and 6am the grid load can be as low as 30% of what it is at peak times (5pm-10pm) - even that peak time can be nearly double the time between 6am-5pm in some areas, so it's not like the lines can't handle that kind of capacity.

let's use alberta: as of the most recent (2020) data there's 3.6million cars registered. if you charged *every* one of those cars at the same time at the *maximum* charge rate of a tesla (11kw) you'd use approximately 40 gigawatts of power.
so the absolute *worst case* scenario is we need 2.5x our current capacity over the next 15 years.

now, obviously every single car registered in the province won't charge at the exact same time, and they will not charge at that maximum rate (for example the model3 maximum rate is only ~8kw).
11kw is such a high charging rate, the average person even if they're doing that every night might only charge for ~1hr, because it's not like they'd be doing 0-100% charges every day. due to smart charging infrastructure management, you can stagger charge, and low power charge when the car knows it won't be needed for 8hrs, since it's also less taxing on the battery to charge at a lower rate. you can probably get that maximum 40gw down to around 10gw - which alberta's *current* grid has about that in spare capacity right now between 12am and 6am.",liberals

the other issue, which has not and likely will not be overcome any time soon, is work vehicles that have to go to remote areas with no infrastructure and long distances between even fuel currently. this is a minority, but these kinds of places are going to require ice vehicles for a long time to come. so predicting 100% of sales, or outlawing ice vehicles is probably not wise. it's reasonable to expect a majority of sales, but i'd say much less that 100%.",liberals

it's a complete failure that it was not written into the building code 10 years ago, or at the very least, to provide room and conduit to install future charging.

also a complete failure outside of vancouver for public transit options which would have lessened the need for this.

but i also think by this time, significant strides in driverless networks will have been made, and it will make little sense for a growing portion of the population to own a vehicle in busier cities. it will definitely be cheaper and more convenient for vast majority of people to rent vehicles on an hourly basis instead of owning a vehicle that sits on the side of the road. this should lower the amount of vehicles we need significantly.

the work vehicles is a good point, and i imagine ford and others will still make 2 tonne and 3 tonne trucks for another 20 years or so for this use case. but eventually they will just be outclassed by electric drive trains and ubiquitous charging. i'm sure there will be companies that make a portable fuel cell option to replace the slip tanks you see nowadays, which would provide very high energy density--perhaps 2000 km of range.

that's my individual situation though. larger buildings will be more complicated and buildings that need service line and panel upgrades will as well. i have plenty of panel space, but not everyone does and it can be very costly adding another meter or upgrading the service, installing a bigger panel etc. i think realistically the government is going to have to provide install grants for this stuff if they're serious and hydro providers need to be part of the equation.",liberals

this was discussed in detail in another thread, but the ad was a little bit different than trump’s election and voter fraud claims. it clearly referred to a number of changes that trudeau’s government introduced to the elections act that give a sitting government an advantage during an election campaign. in that context, “rigging” didn’t refer to the actual voting process (and therefore question the foundation of canadian democracy); it referred to the spending rules of the campaign.

gjlse2y,2021-01-16T23:55:34.000-08:00,"listen up. here are the stakes. &gt;the real problem for conservatives is the lack of education of the voting masses. they know almost nothing about history, particularly canadian history. 

you are absolutely correct. in fact, i sincerely doubt even most conservative voters know much about history. it is very hard to exist in the west in the 21st century without an extremely slanted view of history that is unfair to all our forbears and exculpatory of leftists and all the damage they have historically done.

a prime example is the spanish civil war. what narrative pops into your head when you see that name? if you live in any western country, most likely this:

*bad bad fascists tried to take over country and democracy-loving anarcho-syndicalists tried to stop them! when they failed, the bad bad fascists exterminated their political enemies and spain existed as the equivalent to nazi germany until franco died.*

every statement in my above admittedly strawman history is false. the slightly more nuanced version of some leftist history professor is no less false. but this is what we all believe without having read a damn book about the war. how? leftism is the water we swim in.

that's why i harped on about education. your children need to exist in a bubble for a while. then you need to strap on them a set of impenetrable armour as they venture out into the real world.

&gt;left wing promises for immediate government aid are way easier to enunciate in a quick sound byte than a conservative explaining about market forces lifting all boats. left wing moral arguments for things like climate change and 'helping' people or groups appeal to people more than conservative statements about how nothing we do is going to impact climate change, or the benefits of self-reliance.  
&gt;  
&gt;on top of that nearly half the population pays no income taxes anyway, so doesn't care what's being spent. and a quarter of the population will only vote for a guy from quebec, and the conservatives voter base is out west. not to mention the millions of public sector workers who have zero interest in a party which professes to want to cut government spending.

this is exactly what makes our problem so difficult from a practical perspective. beyond ideology, leftists have the simple fact that, in a democracy, the best strategy is to buy the most votes possible.

conservatives lose by default unless the voters disbelieve the leftists' promises, which is going to happen less and less frequently as the propaganda reaches new levels and the inability to hear other perspectives is shut down. 

now the average person believes that a direct infusion of cash into every pocket from the government will solve all of tomorrow's woes and finally achieve utopia. good luck conservatives. in this environment, you'll only win by becoming the leftists you're meant to oppose.

that's why, to the contradict most of the commenters here, my post is actually pretty light on political content. it's more about how to live your life. i think we need a slow, steady and largely apolitical (or at least not politics forward; you can't escape politics, but it doesn't have to be your primary focus) build-up of an alternative culture that will eventually see through leftist crap and finally lead to better parties to vote for, better voting, and serious reform of our government.",conservatives

furthermore, my point is that you may not be able to vote your values much longer if you have even one right-wing bone in your body. you're absolutely correct that the cpc doesn't represent me or want me.

my point is i don't know who they possibly could represent. if all you want is cheap consumer goods, free money, more diversity and multi-culturalism, less law and order, less freedom to be right-wing, the furtherance of the lgbt agenda, more pleasure with less responsibility, etcetera, then just vote liberal. you'll get all that with either party, but the cpc will do it more slowly and you'll be anathematized in polite society for voting \"wrong.\"

&gt;  
&gt;i'll live and vote by my values. that means i'm not going to not confront extremism just because it is extremism on my side of the political spectrum. you shouldn't either. that's how you get communists and nazis.

not all ethnonationalists are nazis. some just realize the rather obvious truths that \"diversity is our strength\" has little evidence, \"multiculturalism\" means a cultural vacuum, and everyone in the world is allowed and indeed encouraged to have what amounts to an ethnostate except people of european ancestry. are asian countries where 90+% of citizens are asian and african countries where 90+% of citizens are african not ethnostates? do those countries need a good dose of diversity and multiculturalism too, or is that just europe and north america?

whether or not you agree or care, the fact is that every minute you waste denouncing people who aren't taken seriously in society anyway is another minute the left is advancing their agenda without opposition and without guilty conscience. they don't care that literal communists and worse make up the faculty that indoctrinate our youth. why should you care that a nazi has a blog somewhere that a few thousand people read? nazism is the most thoroughly discredited and anathema ideology in human history. that person ain't going to accomplish anything except probably getting himself locked up or killed.

the us laws around native americans that were passed in the 1960s and 1970s are not supposed to supersede treaty rights. generally those laws provide for an expansion of rights rather than limiting them. in cases where existing case law has conflicted with treaty rights, the courts are supposed to judge those as they normally would. the problem there is that us courts have a very terrible track record when it comes to adjudicating treaty rights cases (with the brief exception of the recent court before barrett joined).",liberals

the liberal party of quebec hasn't been affiliated with the liberal party of canada since 1955, is generally more to the right on economic issues than the federal party, has different attitudes on some key issues like bill 96 (the new proposed reinforcement of quebec's charter of the french language), and so on. they and the federal party do share the traits of being federalist, pluralist, and open to immigration.

as for the ndp, the former quebec provincial wing of the federal ndp evolved into québec solidaire which is separatist and totally unaffiliated with the ndp. the ndp recently tried to relaunch provincially in quebec, but when the new ndpq finally did get off the ground, it remained a very minor party with no elected mnas, few candidates, and no affiliation with the federal ndp.

the article is talking about which groups are refusing the vaccination. you're referring to vulnerable groups that are more likely to get infected.

it's sad that you describe immigrants getting sick and possibly dying as \"being a source of spread\". they're dying and the part of that which stands out to you is how much of a threat they pose to you while they die.

people with less money live more to a household, work in denser spaces, and have less capability to stay home if sick. i work from home, a home that isn't a crowded multi-generational household. i worked hard for that but it would be a stretch to say i really earned it. of course i'm less likely to spread covid than an immigrant or aboriginal, the system is designed that way.

&gt; but if you speak of any race other than white men it’s racist so we can’t really talk about facts. 

the article you're commenting on speaks of other races in its text.

&gt; this woman gets a pass to spread falsities because she’s some type of brown woman, but her next article will probably be about white privilege. 

she cites her sources, and for someone who complains that we can't discuss facts, you don't.

the ultimate answer to your question is that 30% of white evangelicals saying they won't get vaccinated is a problem for herd immunity, because people not vaccinating prevents herd immunity. immigrants getting sick more isn't a problem for herd immunity because they can still get vaccinated. that's why the author's concerns are reasonable and yours are not.",conservatives

i'm was not talking about corporate taxes. 

&gt;income taxes are from working a regular job and gets taxed the hardest. our competitive capital gains tax and corporate tax are founded on the ideas of innovation and entrepreneurship - and capital gains in particular encourages investment. we want canadians to pursue risky ventures that pay dividends to canada tenfold if they are successful. this is what our market oriented country has its tax principles based off of. there is a very good reason for it, you choose to ignore it though because you imagine the economy to work differently, and i'd wager entirely different.

you are speaking as if it is the average everyday canadian who would be effected by these tax rates, in reality they are marginal and this kind of policy would only effect the very rich. the average everyday canadian has plenty of room to invest some of their income at a tax rate of *zero* through the tfsa.

as for businesses, they can lower their tax burden by putting that money back into their own business. not only that but small businesses (the \"entrepreneurs\" you mentioned earlier) are already taxed at a completely different rate in canada.

you act as if the mere concept of raising capital gains tax in any way is ruinous, when in reality there is a ton of good reasoning and support behind ideas like simply taxing capital gains as regular income.

&gt;it is hardly a policy proposal, have you spent any time on some of these canadian subreddits? some of these people are filled with absolute rage under the current system and are proposing economic policy that quite literally could devastate the canadian economy. perhaps some reason is needed if we want to call it \"discourse\", or productive discourse at the very least.

you mentioned that they are not all the same, which i recognize, but i was pointing out how they are relevant and important.

israel took west jerusalem as part of the war for independence in 1948 and those borders were formally recognized by the un.

the legality of israel is not based on the un draft it was based on the green line established at the end of the war for independence (also called the pre-1967 borders)

&gt;	this entire statement is false. tel aviv was given to israel by the un. israel took jerusalem through a series of wars thereafter. jerusalem is disputed, even obama was telling israel they must go back to the pre-1967 border.

no, tel aviv would have been allocated to israel in the partition plan but that was never executed as the palestinians rejected the partition plan. the actual partitioning of british palestine occured during the israeli independence war.

the exact same thing happend to jews in the west bank and east jerusalem. they were evicted and lost their homes as well.

unfortunately it seems there are some significant deficiencies in the process:

&gt;the former senior staffer said she raised concerns about saini with human resources, several liberal mps and liberal party staff, but says they they didn't make her case a priority. 

&gt;she said she didn't trust that the process was impartial and wasn't comfortable with the options presented to her, which included mediation with saini, she said. 

&gt;[...]

&gt;sources said the liberals conducted an internal survey in 2018 that flagged concerns about the number of people who experienced some form of harassment or pay inequality between male and female workers. the survey also found issues with how the liberals handled sexual harassment. 

&gt;multiple junior staffers wrote in the survey last year that the prime minister's office should \"fire\" brett thalmann, who is listed as the pmo's executive director of planning, administration and people.

&gt;his role includes signing off on hirings across the pmo and the ministers' offices and working closely with telford, according to the sources. 

&gt;chiefs of staff for liberal mps were asked to meet with their employees in may, where they heard that some junior employees did not trust the party's reporting system, said sources. some staff said they were concerned the process wasn't confidential or impartial, multiple sources said. some staff also raised concerns people were not being disciplined for their actions and that the system wasn't set up to help victims. 

&gt;thalmann, telford and those tasked with human resources then spoke to staff about how the pmo deals with hr complaints on a case by case basis, and explained that there is a process outside of the office that looks into complaints, and a hotline available to staff. many had not ever heard of the hotline, according to sources.

i clicked on this piece frankly expecting some nothingburger ginned up by a disgruntled staffer and/or one of the oppo research teams, disclosed mid-election just to stir up controversy. but this seems a bit more structural/serious.",liberals

like after ndp promised to tax foreign home buyers and cpc promised to ban them for 2 years, the liberals announced they would do the same.  maybe they planned that policy announcement all along, but it's also possible they only decided to commit to that after seeing the cpc promise get a positive reaction (and no backlash).",liberals
hb4jzh7,2021-08-31T10:19:54.000-07:00,"talking to conservatives hmm this comment seems to be baiting me or trying to make me feel bad because i'm not heavily involved in keeping myself up to date on politics nor am i an activist or a member of any particular party nor am i loyal to any particular party.

in my post i indicated that i'm a mid 30s non-political person who votes, but simply reviews the each platform's materials to help me decide who to vote for.

based on my examinations of what i could find about what each party represented and their plan, i felt like the conservative plan was comprehensive and do-able.  while the other plans seems to be quite out there and somewhat wishful without enough substance to back them up although i liked their ideas.  i also admit that i have a financial career background too which seems to give me a bias for the conservative plan because it is very numbers based and contains explanations of what how they think the plan will work.

so i came here to share my view and catch some views of other people.  i realize i posted in conservative, which echos my view, but i couldn't' really find another place to post where i might encounter other information which might make me smarter about this. 

it's strange that you call me lazy? i still gotta vote. i do what i can to make the best decision i can think of based on what's out there based on what i think and base don my conscience.  i honestly take offense to that and i don't think your adding to the discussion in good faith which means your actually part of the problem because you discourage people from being honest and open with what they are up to and what they are thinking because you insult them.",conservatives

many in the crowd are convinced that trudeau is the son of former cuban dictator fidel castro, and one truly terrifying poster depicts the liberal leader as he is about to be executed. many of the demonstrators have toddlers and babies in tow, looking a little dazed amid the cacophony of curses and dumpster-drumming.

james tells me he works in long-term care but saw no evidence of the pandemic in three hospitals he’s visited during the height of covid-19. he believes in peace and love, he says, but a few minutes later, he’s one of the chorus shouting vicious bile at trudeau and police — all proudly before the journalists’ cameras and their own. they hold up their phones like swords and shields, a foul-mouthed and brazen army of political character assassins.”

angela merkel's conservatives were in power during a period which saw syrian refugees settle in the country to such a large extent that they comprise 2% of germanys total population.

there is no singular brand of current conservatism, and *furthermore, if you do follow current conservatism, you should be well aware that neoliberal deficit-hawk conservatism is in a period of decline*. for instance, the current nova scotia pcs (red tories) have an election platform that is spend-heavy and would add significantly to the province's deficit.

the two most straightforward true pr systems are single transferable vote, with its much larger multi-member ridings, and mixed member proportional representation, with a mixture of elected mps and party list mps. of course, all of this has to shoe horn into the constitutional requirements for provincial representation, and i have heard that mmpr may be problematic in this regard, whereas stv somewhat falls apart with much larger rural ridings like those in nunavut, nwt and the yukon.

much like with the residential schools, it never benefit indigenous people to try and sweep that issue under the rug as much as possible. the revelation of dead children recently launched an incredible wave of mainstream support of indigenous causes. i know people that had very ignorant view towards indigenous people, because they often come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds they present as people that are very troubled, which causes a very prejudiced view towards them. only until the revelation of these dead children did the mainstream discourse suddenly turn towards the horrifying history of the indigenous in canada, at which point the people i knew finally began to understand why these people became the way they are.

i'm thinking the bloc weaken just enough to give the liberals more seats from quebec but the ndp make up for it in bc and the liberals flip a handful of tossups cpc / ndp seats elsewhere like ontario or in urban edmonton or calgary after the kenney fiasco.

not a lot. like one maybe 2 seats red, and 1 maybe 2 ndp. mainly due to vote splitting and kenney anger combined.

for the second time, it’s not about storage, it’s about production. [the crown costs $260 million to produce.](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/16/from-the-crown-to-game-of-thrones-whats-the-most-expensive-tv-show-ever) that’s $260 million that cannot be spend on other shows. i don’t know how else to explain this to you.

&gt;i gave you a list of services and somehow that's being vague?

you were vague about which were supposed to be “scary foreign content distributors”. netflix and youtube have fundamentally different business models. are you treating them both as “scary foreign content distributors” or making distinctions with respect to their “scariness”? do you think the goals of c-10 in respect of each is identical?

&gt;i don't see any evidence that they made an attempt.

i don’t see any evidence of the relevance of that. whether or not they attempted to create open platforms like youtube, they do not have them, and therefore your claim that regulating them somehow benefits bell or rogers is demonstrably false.

&gt;all of those operate transnationally now. editors are hired from all over the world, transitions are custom made by studios abroad, whole digital effects industries are off-shore. journalism has long used independent foreign correspondents and international field offices, even.

what editors? hired by whom to edit what? off of which shore?

and you really think that foreign correspondents and international field offices is proof of…what, exactly? if cbc news has a foreign correspondent, then cbc doesn’t make canadian news? that their correspondents aren’t reporting in english and french, the official languages of canada, like a foreign correspondent from denmark reports from abroad in danish? that they are not reflecting on international events from a canadian point of view, or linking foreign issues to canadian ones? that canadian local and national news is not important? that we’re “post-national” and canada doesn’t exist anymore?

if none of it matters, you should have no problem watching or reading the news in danish each night. if that strikes you as problematic, maybe you need to reflect on the issue more. and if you think cnn and fox should just step in, and that’s fine, “because they’re in english,” then you and i *really* have different views of the global media landscape right now.",liberals

fun fact about the blood donation ban: think about trans people. here's some real weird quirks in the system:

1. a trans man, if he registers and first donates blood before updating his identification, can still donate, even if he's gay and has bottomed for every gay man in town in the last 24 hours.

2. the exact same trans man, who updated his identity *then* went to donate, cannot.

3. a straight trans woman, despite only having sex with straight men, cannot donate. neither can her partner. 

4. if that trans woman were to get bottom surgery, later that year, she's eligible to donate, despite no change in behaviour. so too is her partner. 

literally none of that is backed up by statistical risk, it's actually just fucking nonsense. canada blood services thinks hiv is stored in the balls or something, i guess. number 4 on that list is especially ridiculous - my friend was unable to donate blood for years, his girlfriend gets an unrelated surgery, and 3 months later he's able to donate again. absolutely none of that is about 'statistics', it's rules being applied wildly incorrectly.

also, like... monogamous gay men exist. if both you and your partner are hiv-, and it's a monogamous relationship, doesn't matter in the slightest whether you're gay or not. 

it's not about statistics. sure, that was the motivation for making the rule in the first place. but in hindsight, the rule's overly broad and creates countless scenarios that are absolutely absurd, so maybe it's time to update it to more accurately reflect real life.",liberals

but i think our definitions of privilege might differ here. the millions of millennials i'm generalizing (ie. the ones who took art degrees and wound up with little prospects) didn't go to private schools. many of them come from divorced families. many of them have half or full immigrant families. many of them are poc or lgbt. 

the preppy, white, upper-class kid who took an arts degree doesn't have to worry about the little job prospects. daddy likely paid for the degree, and they probably end up with a well paying job regardless.

the institutional problem comes in when millions of people from middle class backgrounds are making the same decisions because they've been pigeon holed into them. 

my own experience being one anecdote, but there are definitely millions just like me. my dad was a steel worker and told me to never work at dofasco. my mother's side all worked in construction and told me never to work in trades. all of us, cousins included, go to university as a result. none of us end up in a job related to our degree. my cousins all still live at home, going into their early 30s/late 20s now. my youngest sister lives at home. 

i went into aviation, which is radically different from my education. i own a home. my job pays well and i am content. but did i need to waste 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars to learn this lesson? i'm one of the lucky ones in this case. most people in this cohort don't end up with a well-paying salaried job. they feel duped and angry. and i am empathetic to them, because had my luck been slightly different, i would be the same. 

hence, back to my first point: this is a generation that would be most likely to become attached to extreme ideology. they grew up in a stable, affluent environment. and now they are saddled with debt. they have no chance of owning a home. even starting a family seems impossible with inflation. economic conditions are better predictors of political instability.",liberals

if im not mistaken, the money spent on r&amp;d by governments for the covid vaccines was given either to universities and research centres, or sometimes directly to pharmaceutical companies to aid in their r&amp;d. once any publicly funded research is published any of these companies have access to it to use it to make their vaccine. canada (and most other countries) don't have a nationalized pharmaceutical producer, which means we have private companies come and produce our medications and vaccines for us. sometimes this system has its merits, but in a global pandemic when we need as many vaccines as fast as possible it's far better to enable any vaccine manufacturing facility to be allowed to make them, not just the ones owned by pfizer or moderna.

hopb3jd,2021-12-15T06:19:03.000-08:00,"trudeau open to discussing decriminalization of hard drugs &gt;a good first step, but the best approach would be to remove all drug use from the criminal-legal realm altogether and properly categorize it as a health problem, not a legal one.

disagree 100%.

dealers and distributors of crack, meth, and heroin should be criminally charged. most are connected to street gangs or criminal entities in the first place, so there you go.

addicts who engage in criminal or antisocial behaviour in pursuit of getting their fix or under the influence of these substances should likewise be criminally charged. domestic criminal law applies to everyone. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;all the resources currently allocated to drug stings, courts, lawyers, jails... if instead were invested in treatment programs, hospitals, nurses, and even safe supply and safe use sites, would not only save lives, but also save money.

safe needle sites and other \"safe use\" zones only become a hub for drug dealing and criminality. vancouver is the most notorious case in point but toronto has some pretty notorious examples as well.

the safe needle exchange at moss park, for one instance. speaks for itself really. 

you're also forgetting that many of the people you seek to help with treatment programs and social workers and sympathy often don't want your help, and will gaslight you or otherwise manipulate you if they think they can get away with it. rehabilitation programs ought to be mandatory and hosted in facilities that they can't just waltz in and out of casually.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;it's a health problem, which can't be solved by getting tough on it any more than we could address cancer with cops and courts.

drugs that are never safe and only increase antisocial behaviour and criminality will always at least be partially a legal issue. 

weed you can legalize and regulate. same with hash, and arguably cocaine. hallocinogenics and mdma, sure.

but crack and meth and heroin? hard no.",liberals

final seat counts (and vote share):

* lpc: 156 (31.8%)
* cpc: 121 (31.4%)
* ndp: 31 (19.5%)
* bq: 29 (6.9%)
* gpc: 1 (4.0%)
* ppc: 0 (5.4%)
* others: 0 (1.0%)

these numbers aren't exactly unique, are they? i feel like most of the prediction sites are around these overall seat numbers. even the 'outliers' are only in the 160s for the lpc (or mid 140s on 338, it seems), which is not exactly a fundamental difference.

[map](https://i.imgur.com/r6sut36.png) of all of the constituency results, darker colours are gains and lighter are holds.

to make that easier to discern, [here](https://i.imgur.com/exuok6d.png) are all of the 22 seats i have changing hands. i wouldn't pay too close attention to actual vote share numbers in my model, but i'm going to post them just for the banter. 22 seats switching hands seems low for an entire federal election, but we'll see i guess.

[the 28 seats i have within 3%](https://imgur.com/mqv8nmp) (i was originally going to separate out the ones within 1% but there are only 6 of these.)

[the 30 seats between 3% and 5%](https://i.imgur.com/tp4urxs.png)
