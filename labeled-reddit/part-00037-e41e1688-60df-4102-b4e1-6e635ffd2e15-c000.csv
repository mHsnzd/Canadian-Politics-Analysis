personally i think high speed rail could be used to get across canada eventually and it might have a a staring role in making this country more dense. if you started with the quebec/ontario corridor and alberta you’d have a start. the maybe extensions can be thought of connecting vancouver with alberta and the maritimes with quebec. you’d have two hubs on each side of the country for transit and then maybe winnipeg can connect the two hubs together. but this is a minimum 50 year plan",liberals

btw equalization payment is not determined by how much a province contributes to the pot. equalization entitlements are determined by measuring provinces' ability to raise revenues – known as \"fiscal capacity\".
before any adjustments, a province's per capita equalization entitlement is equal to the amount by which its fiscal capacity is below the average fiscal capacity of all provinces – known as the \"10 province standard\".

and no it’s not quebec’s fault that manitoba used the clause once. my point was that other provinces play by the rules even they don’t like it. quebec on the other hand ignores any rules it does not like. 

i think the other provinces need to become as aggressive as quebec in their use of the “notwithstanding” clause. it’s in the constitution, why other provinces don’t use is it as regularly as quebec is very surprising. that must change.

2. leslyn lewis is a parachute candidate. if the local cpc team accepts her (haldimand-norfolk did vote for her in the leadership contest after all), then it won't be a problem. but if there's resentment among the local activists that some insider from toronto with no connection to the region was parachuted in, it could hurt their efforts to organize and mobilize volunteers. this is especially important because,
3. again, it's a byelection. these are low-turnout affairs, and with covid, even more so. convincing people to come out and vote in the middle of a pandemic for a byelection that won't affect the national picture is difficult. if ground game is weak, this becomes a problem. also,
4. haldimand-norfolk is a very rural area. if you parachute a candidate into a downtown toronto riding it barely makes a dent because \"local connection\" isn't seen as so important in urban areas. but in rural areas where everyone knows everyone, people care about this stuff. finally,
5. ppc could capitalize on anti-lockdown/anti-ford sentiment to siphon off cpc votes.

all that said i don't think lewis will lose this one, it's a huge gap for the lpc to make up. but there could be factors at play that make this seat a bit less safe than it was for diane finley.",conservatives

you also seem to be very misinformed about the nature of the trial. the federal government isn't challenging the definition of the class, which is children removed from their homes and sent to off-reserve welfare facilities - aka, residential schools. the people who's friends and classmates were buried in mass graves by the government of canada.

they are challenging cash payouts as the appropriate solution. the human rights act proscribes a payout of $20,000 per individual if a child was removed without due cause, and an additional $20,000 if the conditions they experienced were abusive or neglectful. as these programs were conducted en mass, they were not conducted with due cause such as an abuse complaint in the family. as the residential schools were awful, the additional compensation is mandated. it's an incredibly open and shut case.

the only challenge to the class has been from people arguing it isn't big enough, and that more people should be awarded the settlement.",liberals

h0hcpmh,2021-06-03T06:13:58.000-07:00,"singh demands trudeau drop legal battle against first nations children, survivors i decided to look up [the human rights tribunal ruling](https://fncaringsociety.com/sites/default/files/2019_chrt_39.pdf) at stake.

the tribunal did *not* rule that \"everyone covered by this ruling suffered $20,000 worth of harm so that's fair compensation for everyone\". what they said was:

&gt;the panel highlights that our legislation places a cap on the remedies under sections [53 (2) (e) and 53 (3) of the chra](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-9.html#doccont) for victims the maximum being $40,000 and that this amount is reserved for the worst cases. the panel believes that the unnecessary removal of children from your homes, families and communities qualifies as a worst-case scenario which will be discussed further below and, a breach of your fundamental human rights. the panel stresses the fact that this amount can never be considered as proportional to the pain suffered and accepting the amount for remedies is not an acknowledgment on your part that this is its value. no amount of compensation can ever recover what you have lost, the scars that are left on your souls or the suffering that you have gone through.... in awarding the maximum amount allowed under our statute, the panel recognizes, to the best of its ability and with the tools that it currently has under the chra, that this case of racial discrimination is one of the worst possible cases warranting the maximum awards.

in other words, *taking someone's child* is so bad that $40,000 is appropriate compensation in any case. the tribunal clearly thinks that far more compensation should be owed in the case of \"in care for years\", but lacks the statutory authority to award more than $40,000.

if the government thinks that it's unfair to only compensate everyone $40,000 then it should raise the statutory maximum on compensation that the hrt can award. this maximum is not indexed to inflation and has not been increased in decades. alternately, the government could negotiate compensation above and beyond this amount without forcing a battle in the federal court.

the likely conclusion of forcing a case-by-case analysis of each victim is that the crown would wind up owing *even more money*, since cases where someone was unjustly taken for a short duration would still probably wind up with five figures of compensation anyway, while egregious cases might wind up getting far more in individual compensation.  however, quoting again from the ruling,

&gt;the panel in considering access to justice, efficiency and expeditiousness has opted for the above orders to avoid a case-by-case assessment of degrees of pain and suffering for each child, parent or grand-parent referred to in the orders above. as stated by the nan, there is no perfect solution on this issue, the panel agrees. the difficulty of the task at hand does not justify denying compensation to victims/survivors. in recognizing that the maximum of $20,000 is warranted for any of the situations described above, the case-by-case analysis of pain and suffering is avoided and it is attributed to a vulnerable group of victims/survivors who as exemplified by the evidence in this case have suffered as a result of the systemic racial discrimination. some children and parents or grandparents may have suffered more than others however, the compensation remedies are capped under the chra and the panel cannot award more than the maximum allowed even if it is a small amount in comparison to the degree of harm and of racial discrimination experienced by the first nations children and their families. the maximum compensation awarded is considered justifiable for any child or adult being part of the groups identified in the orders above.

we might also ask how much it would cost to set up individual hearings for each victim and for the government to litigate each case individually.

what i think is really going on is that the crown knows that many victims will not be in a position to litigate with the government individually to establish the compensation that would be fairly owed to them, so the government is hoping that striking down this ruling would lead to many of the victims never pursuing their cases individually.",liberals

\\- st. john's east is a jack harris seat not an ndp seat, and mainstreet poll had the liberals up by 20% last week in that seat.

\\- the only seats they had a chance of flipping in the maritimes are halifax and dartmouth-cole harbour.  dartmouth-cole harbour is pretty much out of the question now that there is no cpc candidate to help split the vote (whenever ndp carried this in the past even when mcdonough was leader and running next door, they never had more than 36% of the vote, so they won't win without a cpc candidate).  halifax is still a possibility, but with liberal polling it atlantic canada recovering to 2019 levels, i can't see them making up the deficit.  most likely scenario is complete ndp wipe out in atlantic canada.

\\- brosseau had a decent change of winning back berthier-maskicogne, but the fallout from the english debate and singh's handling of it, plus legault endorsing cpc/bq is going to make flipping that seat back unlikely.

\\- debate fallout also could well take down boulerice as well, although less likely.

if this happens, singh's leadership is likely dead in the water.  although, it's not hard to think that the liberals, cpc, ndp, and greens will all have new leaders by next election at this point.",liberals

if you go back into the committee debate on c-83 that introduced this, the ndp and pretty much every witness aside from government officials predicted this was going to happen. the accountability structure is largely internal which was one of the reasons it was found unconstitutional. if i remember correctly an external reviewer wouldn’t be possible in most cases until 60-90 days after a chain of decisions were made, even though beyond 14 days is considered torture.",liberals

having said that, i firmly believe that the vaccines are a part of the solution moving forward, but it is not a solution in and of itself. the reasons that vaccines are not an exit strategy on their own are:

* as the virus mutates, there will be vaccine escapees (covid variants the vaccine does not cover). this will re introduce infection.
* vaccine only lasts about a year, unless we vaccine everyone all at the same time, as one person's shots expire they could become sick again. as an additional challenge, we can't vaccinate everyone even if we had enough vaccines (those too young, pregnant women, and those who are very elderly, those who don't want the vaccine).

in my opinion vaccination on it's own is not a viable exit strategy to covid.",conservatives

there are thousands upon thousands of unmanned border between canada and the us. 

we can't close every border crossing without a giant wall, and it would solve a problem that for us is infinitesimally small.

i don't think its worth putting a border crossing there, i don't think its worth the money to build any sort of barrier, etc. but if thats what quebec as a province requests i don't think its inherently bad for ottawa to listen to the concerns that the province has. but they didn't ask for it last i checked, and its just a way for him to drum up only in quebec support with the spectre of illegal immigrants. 

it's just bad optics and its not framed correctly and it's being done at the end of a campaign in a province he's polling poorly in and only done in one of the two official languages because he knows the position as taken with those words won't play well in the the 905 or other parts of ontario.",conservatives

so no, they are not crossing illegally. if they were coming for a family vacation and intending to leave a week later then it would be illegal. but it isn't illegal precisely because they have claimed asylum. 

now we can argue the merits of the safe third country agreement, the loophole its created and all that. that's fine. 

but the idea that crossing the border at roxham road is illegal, stops being a train of thought the moment they claim asylum. 

and before we get there, yes, they do get arrested, because they crossed the border without being at a controlled crossing and it is therefore presumed illegal. the moment they claim asylum, they no longer committed a criminal act, because, they did not cross illegally. 

an analogy if it helps:

you get pulled over and forget your wallet. in ontario, i assume likely the case in other places, driving without a license is illegal, you'll get a ticket. they write the ticket. you can then present your license within 48 hours to a local station and they will cancel your ticket. why? you were not \"driving without a license\" you were just driving without a license on your person. does that make sense? the after the fact confirmation of the fact that you are licensed meant it wasn't illegal therefore no ticket. but as a precaution to avoid you skipping out on the fine, they give you a ticket. 

&amp;#x200b;

its this same concept, after the fact confirmation, not illegal in retrospect, no charge, but interim arrest. 

&amp;#x200b;

why is the law the way it is? because it was written to comply with an international agreement and law that didn't account way way back for a safe third country agreement or the reality of the fact canada and the us share a giant border.",conservatives

it is not illegal to enter canada and request asylum, whether that be at a port-of-entry or not.

however, international law requires a prospective asylee to request asylum in the first unhcr-compliant state that they arrive in. so, any prospective asylee who transits the united states in order to claim asylum in canada, or who fails to make a request for asylum in the united states while there, prior to moving on to trying their luck in canada is acting contrary to what international law permits/allows - a person cannot \"forum-shop\" for asylum.

the bottom line (for me) is that anyone who \"skips\" making a claim for asylum in the united states needs to be sent back to the u.s. - not because they are violating canadian law (they aren't), but because they are violating international law that governs the issue of asylees.

please note that this is not a harsh outcome - *under present law*, unsuccessful claimants for asylum are *sent back to their original country of origin/citizenship*, not back to the u.s. for most, that is a much worse outcome than simply making a claim for asylum in the u.s.",conservatives

parliament can’t find the government in contempt while the case (and the inevitable appeals) are going on. they also cannot force the release of the documents (as that would nullify the entire issue before the courts). this has only been filed at the federal court and it will be a very long time before any supreme court judgement. in the meantime we will see the entire makeup of parliamentarians inevitably change. there’s a far larger chance that this issue will be rendered moot by an election long before those documents are released.

trudeau’s argument is essentially that parliament can either amend the legislation or vote no confidence. he’s successfully called the opposition parties’ bluff. they won’t be able to get the amendment through and they’re not willing to force an election over documents that may or may not be essential to national security.",liberals

well personally i evaluate local candidate, party leader and party platform before casting a ballot. all three are important considerations. 

i think you underestimate the impact of leaders on party governance once in power. having a certain leader may mean the difference between competent and incompetent governance, between rallying the general population behind you vs governing just for your base, etc. leaders create their own social atmosphere and ability to legislate with their skills and weaknesses.

its a bit technical but - if the credit is paid out in advance for a child who started care in the prior tax year then it's easy. 

the issue lies in people who are doing the first year of care for a child. it will depend on what proof a parent can provide prior to the child starting care that they are in fact \\*going\\* to start care, and then how they get the credit in advance as a result. 

so in the qc example, application needs to be in december 1 for a full year. what if the child is to start care in january, how does one prove, before dec 1 that the kid will be in care in january? do they wait until january to apply? then do they still get the refundable credit applied to january if the application is processed in february?

administratively there's a certain burden that may or may not be worth the headache. if one is going to use a refundable credit system, the faster, easier and more administratively cheap thing to do is a direct transfer rather than a refundable credit, for example through the ccb, which was part of the original plan for harper's childcare cheques to begin with. 

but for kids already in care, and who have proof of existing care, the advance credit system does work. i just don't know if its a great - cost to benefit administratively - approach from the federal perspective. maybe those administrative costs at the federal budget level are better defrayed through the direct province transfer, or through a significant boost to the canada child benefit, which would for people who are stay at home parents for financial reasons the choice to use those funds to pay more into an resp, or pay for familial necessities on a single income, etc.

ultimately it's fine, but it doesn't scream traditional conservative free market approach to use the tax credit either. the value of the liberal's plan - the expected administrative cost, as a direct transfer spread equally as a boost to the under 5 ccb would probably have been a more small c conservative plan, with a lower total overhead, and a better political alignment, that could also have served as a platform plank on affordability. but that's just how i see it from the outside in.",liberals

it's not controversial.  each vaccine approved to date has undergone 3 phases of trials with tens of thousands of participants, the results were independently reviewed, and those results were again confirmed by gov't health authorities across the world.  there is no scientific ambiguity surrounding the safety or efficacy of these vaccines.  in fact, as of yesterday, 210 million vaccines have been administered with no reported statistically significant adverse outcomes.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;my point is that the % of efficacy vs recovery is only 2%.

those are two completely different measurements and are not comparable.  efficacy measures the probability of infection if exposed to the virus, recovery is whether someone that has contracted the virus dies (also known as mortality).

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;my comments and information do not come from only one site/ article. some of the percentages i have provided are an “on average” percentile.

that's not how scientific studies work.  you can't 'take the average' of different studies without re-analyzing the combined meta data.  in fact, you haven't provided a single study that supports a single number that you have stated.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;pfizer vaccine being 94% effective at preventing asymptomatic infections and 97% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, severe disease and death

this literally means that the vaccine is 94% effective at preventing any form of infection.  if they can't find any virus in your body, you can't be contagious.  this study was published two days ago.  it supersedes the month old data you are referencing.  things are moving quickly here.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households.

good news!  more is known.  the data just came out of israel that the pfizer vaccine does in fact prevent transmissibility.

&amp;#x200b;

hold on - the strengthened climate policy that the liberals announced in december, continuing to raise the national carbon price floor by $15/t each year from 2022 to 2030, does hit the paris targets.

under the 2016 agreement negotiated with the provinces, the carbon price floor rises by $10/t each year until it reaches $50/t in 2022, but the agreement didn't say what happens after that. pembina estimated that continuing to raise it by $10/t each year after that would be sufficient to hit the 2030 target. the pbo made a similar estimate. so raising it by $15/t should certainly do it.

flexibility is one big advantage of carbon pricing. if scientists tell us we need to cut emissions faster, we can raise the carbon price faster.

https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/documents/reports/rp-2021-019-s/rp-2021-019-s_en.pdf - see the \"dynamic obps\" scenario

next question is, what about after 2030? (assuming the cpc drops their opposition to carbon pricing before they form government again.) the target is net zero by 2050. under c-12, the government will set an interim target every five years, and take advice from an outside board to figure out the policies needed to hit the new target.

there's two risks. one is technical - we know how to decarbonize electricity and transport, which together account for 50% of future emissions, but decarbonizing industrial processes will be much harder. the other is political - one-third of canadians do not believe that climate change is a major problem, and a lot of them support the cpc, so the cpc is still committed to scrapping carbon pricing as soon as it forms government again.",liberals
gtqcx1r,2021-04-07T06:44:40.000-07:00,"the price of o’toole’s political ploy by melanie joly, minister of regional economic development. she argues that o'toole and the conservatives are stalling approval of the measures in the fall economic statement, including more funds for small businesses via the regional relief and recovery fund.

&gt; the reality the conservatives’ tactics ignore is that the rrrf has been a lifeline for businesses across the country. this is particularly true in northern ontario. delivered through economic development organizations like fednor, the fund is designed specifically for businesses that have a hard time getting access to other federal relief programs, and it’s helped those businesses make ends meet and keep employees on the payroll.
&gt;
&gt; in northern ontario, over 1,000 applications for covid-19 support from fednor have been approved, totalling almost $80 million, supporting just over 4,000 jobs. in more concrete terms, the rrrf provided a fly-in fishing operator near red lake with the funds needed to mitigate the impacts of covid-19, keep their operations running and their staff working.",conservatives

my primary concern at this point is a disconnect occurring between value and dollars. between financing and spending. i think the liberals are dangerously close to “the final total dollar amount doesn’t really matter” and that the consequences to them of raising taxes to actually pay for the spending will always be greater than the consequences of going further into debt. and so further into debt we go. keeping rich friends happy by keeping taxes low and keeping voters happy by spending away our future.

i’m worried about an attitude of having our cake and eating it too. which is always difficult situation for people to get out of. same thing with the environment. we can feel good about ourselves after shutting in canadian oil production but then don’t actually take steps to reduce consumption. people want the end result but don’t want to pay the piper.",liberals

secondly, both members of the government and the public servants who worked on the project testified at committee hearings that there were no organizations other than we who could handle the project. while there were some claims to the contrary by other organizations, notably the ymca, later examinations indicated this to be correct. the president of the ymca later clarified, for example, that \"in normal times\" the ymca would have the capacity, but could not under the conditions imposed by covid-19. once public outcry caused the government to drop the contract with we there were simply no other options to turn to.",liberals

gy01zrj,2021-05-13T03:30:40.000-07:00,"trudeau did not break federal ethics rules in we charity scandal — but morneau did it's always disappointing to see the discussions that come from articles and situations like this. while i can understand the persecution complex, from a non-partisan, or less partisan perspective, there were legitimate questions worth asking and now, after seemingly a lot of resistance, there is an answer. can we stop with the conspiracy labeling and \"truther\" terminology, there was clearly an issue worth examining here, such dismissive cringy catch phrasing is pathetic. are you really trying to draw a connection between 911 truthers and people that think there was something strange about the way we was awarded the contract? do you really think these two things are on the same level? maybe some individuals fit that level of contempt but it's highly dismissive to an issue that did have some fire behind the smoke. (side note, if you think you can investigate any issue and find fire, that's not a meaningful defense of how government does things)

i'm okay with a general suspicion of government actions, particularly when contracting. you really can't pretend that government contracting has not been a huge source of corruption in the past. plus, the preferential treatment that the report does talk about really substantiates concerns about the relationship between private charity and government. i really don't think any government defender should read this report and feel particularly good about it.  

the glee on display is disappointing, we really have lost any sense that really supporting something involves criticism haven't we? the whole if you really love your country you can criticize their decisions ideal. if there is an impression that certain parties would make a mountain of out nothing, there's an equal perception that other parties would defend anything. like, for instance, the we charity itself which for a bunch of folks has suddenly become a martyred victim rather than a mediocre self indulgent charity that will not be missed. 

i didn't follow this scandal, but i've followed several of the past ones, and the responses i've seen around here and the fanatical defenses were about the same, it just happens that they were more right this time.",liberals

gwa9571,2021-04-28T21:34:41.000-07:00,"globe editorial: old age security costs more every year. the trudeau government’s budget is making it worse paywall.

excerpts

&gt;the demarcation of age 65 for old age  security had been established in the mid-1960s, when gis was also  created. poverty among seniors in that era was distressingly high. oas  and gis were a big success, and poverty among seniors plummeted.  
&gt;  
&gt;by the 1980s, seniors’ poverty [matched the national rate](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/poverty-reduction/backgrounder.html), and kept falling. in 2019, the percentage of seniors struggling on a low income [was 5.4 per cent](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110013501&amp;pickmembers%5b0%5d=1.1&amp;cubetimeframe.startyear=2016&amp;cubetimeframe.endyear=2019&amp;referenceperiods=20160101%2c20190101). the rate for children under 18 was 9.7 per cent, and for people 18 to 64 it was 11.6 per cent.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;in last week’s behemoth budget, mr.  trudeau made good on a campaign promise to bolster oas spending. this  investment makes less sense. the plan includes a one-time $500 payment  this summer to people 75 and older, and a 10-per-cent increase for the  same age group next year. payouts of about [$7,420 a year](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/old-age-security.html) would rise $740, to $8,160, in july, 2022.  
&gt;  
&gt;the  money is not specifically aimed at low-income seniors who need it most,  though they will certainly appreciate the gain. it’s a blanket increase. oas payments are reduced only for seniors starting at an income of about $79,000. that level exceeds [canada’s average income](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901) by $30,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;those benefits are, and will remain, the federal government’s biggest  transfer program. if the new money were focused on lower-income seniors,  the argument would be clear. as of last year, almost 40 per cent of  seniors over 75 received gis. they would definitely benefit from a  boost. but a considerable amount of the oas bump will go to seniors who  are already doing quite well.

the way i see it, changing the oas means-tested threshold is a conversation that needs to happen sooner rather than later.  the present threshold of $79k makes no sense when the average canadian income runs at $50k.

edit:  based on comments, i just want to add that this conversation can't happen without also opening  ones about wealth taxes and corporate taxes.",liberals

this article is three years old, so i can only imagine how much worse it is. like i said, artificial scarcity that's a result of, not supply issues, but low interest rates, money laundering and house flipping. 

&gt;more than a third of toronto’s condominiums are owned by people who don’t live in them, according to new government figures which suggest that more cities across canada could be facing a growing struggle with [housing affordability](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/canada-housing-prices-vancouver-asia-justin-trudeau).
figures released this week by [statistics canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190611/dq190611a-eng.htm) show that 37.9% of toronto condos are not owner-occupied, meaning they are either vacant, rented or used as a second property.

&gt;the new statistics offer further evidence that people now view housing as an investment, and not necessarily as a place to live, said andy yan, the director of [the city program](https://www.sfu.ca/continuing-studies/about/program-units/city-program.html) at simon fraser university in vancouver.
yan said **the data shows that housing prices have “decoupled” from income, and are instead driven by access to capital – giving investors a clear advantage over average canadians. “it’s not about supply or demand any more,” said yan. “it’s: who are we building for?”**

you are choosing to use one specific meaning of neoliberalism. thats ok, but don't pretend its the only definition.

as an example of how words can have multiple meanings, lets think of good old \"liberalism\". originally, it means that people should have rights as individuals, that they should receive the benefits of their labor (or lack thereof) and promotes the free trade of goods and services, at least roughly speaking. today, what a \"liberal\" is really depends on who you ask, but most people would say it is people who are \"on the left\" or are \"progressives\".",liberals

&gt; we do not all subscribe to a single comprehensive philosophy but instead find common ground in shared sentiments and approaches to public policy.
&gt; 
1. individual choice and markets are of paramount importance both as an expression of individual liberty and driving force of economic prosperity.
1. the state serves an important role in establishing conditions favorable to competition through preventing monopoly, providing a stable monetary framework, and relieving acute misery and distress.
1. free exchange and movement between countries makes us richer and has led to an unparalleled decline in global poverty.
1. public policy has global ramifications and should take into account the effect it has on people around the world regardless of nationality.

edit: the radical left which has become the mainstream left still lies about cases involving michael brown (us) and regis korchinski-paquet (ontario). they still push the conspiracy that they have been murdered by the police despite external investigations proving otherwise. moderate liberals just keep silent about it.
