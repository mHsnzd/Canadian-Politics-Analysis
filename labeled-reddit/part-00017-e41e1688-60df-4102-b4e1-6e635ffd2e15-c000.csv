this is a fascinating concept of “due process”. cabinet appeals are, unsurprisingly, appeals to cabinet—i.e. appeals to the government of the day. they are political appeals on political considerations, not legal appeals, which go to the federal court of appeal pursuant to s. 31 of the *broadcasting act* (which c-10 doesn’t change). the crtc itself has [rules of practice and procedure](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/2010-959.htm), which is to say, it has its own due process, which would presumably be followed in any crtc decision that would be subject to cabinet appeal. [cabinet appeals under the current act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/b-9.01/page-5.html#h-34439), at s. 28, provide for barely any process at all, beyond filing a petition within a specific time frame. it is effectively lobbying government to overturn a decision reached by an arm’s length quasi-judicial body following a legal procedure and based on evidence, and to effectively replace it with one based on political pressure. 

and michael geist essentially thinks that large corporations—predominantly, if not exclusively, foreign corporations—have some kind of inherent right to this kind of corporate lobbying as “due process”? really?",liberals

[source](https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-ontario.html)
&gt; in 2017, ontario’s electricity sector emitted 2.0 mt co2e emissions, or 3% of total canadian ghg emissions attributable to power generation. ontario’s ghg emissions from power generation peaked in 2000 at 43.4 mt co2e and then saw emissions decline as it phased out coal-fired generation from 2005 to 2014.

as part of trying to phase out coal so aggressively and successfully they over did it with natural gas power plants. ontario's energy demand lagged behind what was initially expected (yeah?) so the natural gas plants were less needed but the contracts were signed and had to be honoured. it was one of the reasons that led to them being voted out in 2018.

so between 2005 and 2017 ontario's co2 output went from 205 megatonnes to 159 megatonnes.

over a similar period alberta's went up from 235 megatonnes in 2005 to 272 megatonnes in 2017.
&gt; - the largest emitting sectors in alberta are oil and gas production at 50% of emissions, electricity generation at 16%, and transportation at 11% (figure 8).
- alberta’s ghg emissions from the oil and gas sector in 2017 were 137.1 mt co2e. of this total, 130.8 mt were attributable to production, processing, and transmission and 6.4 mt were attributable to petroleum refining and natural gas distribution.

harper's climate policy was to allow for the massive increase in pollution from the tar sands. provincially in ontario, liberals implemented great change. federally, they passed a carbon tax. the carbon tax (weak as it is, i think it should be higher) lost them their majority in 2019, so don't call the carbon tax nothing.",liberals

ha1ruvc,2021-08-23T02:27:02.000-07:00,"the poll thread - monday, august 23, 2021 complaining that \"housing is provincial/local jurisdiction\" and that they can do \"basically zero\" is both a complete abdication and categorically untrue. there are absolutely things that can be done, it just requires some combination of ambition, imagination, will, and maybe a risk or two. plus some creativity around what \"having an effect\" on housing really means. it's not just \"make prices go up\", \"make prices go down\", \"make it easier to afford the down payment on a house\" or anything simplistic like that, even though good housing policy may influence some of those things in the long term. it's about restructuring \"the deal\" that cities, provinces, citizens and immigrants get so that housing insecurity and expense aren't so all-consuming, and so they contribute less to both national and local inequity.

things the liberals could choose to do:

1. carrot/stick on land use - directly give cities funding, either for public housing, mass transit, roads, or whatever in exchange for densification...or pull funding when cities can't or won't meet housing growth targets. health care is provincial jurisdiction but the federal government sets pretty clear parameters around how provincial health care can be delivered and this has worked extremely well for decades.
2. extra funding based on population growth for cities and/or provinces on capex/opex to grow housing or transit (since better transit is a housing supply investment in disguise) which grow their population to offset the increased strain on local infrastructure. potentially just give jurisdictions one-time cash grants, per-person, on the basis of people who move there. all of canada benefits hugely from population growth in the long term, but in the short term the levels of government who actually need to deliver services (cities and provinces) are an increased burden. the federal government is 100% in a position to offset this.
3. finally acknowledge that homeownership in major population centres is basically out of reach for even those with good earnings prospects by giving renters fairer tax treatment. right now owners receive massive tax subsidies that renters don't. removing the principal residence capital gains tax exemption isn't practical, but there are many other options. maybe we can let renters deduct a portion of rent from their income. just imagine how long someone earning even $100k/year needs to save to buy a home now, and how much tax they're paying while the owner next door is invested in an asset class that grows tax free, indefinitely - and when that owner was gifted their down payment from a parent, even the initial investment wasn't really taxed. or who knows. give renters additional tfsa room on the basis of rents paid during years as tenants. pay for some of that by increasing the capital gains inclusion rate on non-owner-occupied housing to 100%, or introduce a federal luxury home sale surtax, or stop handing seniors $500 cheques, or any number of other options. just do...literally anything to even appear to try and level the playing field between owners and renters so we can let go of this insanely regressive corner of our tax regime.
4. encourage *actual* housing security for long-term renters. tax policy or cmhc support to incentivize purpose-built private sector rentals (much of the tax side of this was repealed at some point in the 70s, iirc), setting and meeting targets for housing completions similar to what we were achieving in the 70s. and make sure the incentives focus on developments with a healthy # of family-sized rental units and professional management rather than mom/pop condo investor landlords who, in concert with local rent control, build up incentives over time to renovict or sell to capture price appreciation.
5. economic incentives for immigrants or maybe even canadians who land (and remain) in less populated canadian cities or regions with anemic population growth or poor economic, maybe including partnerships with provinces/cities to fund local cultural infrastructure and amenities relevant to the countries canadian immigrants are coming from. if you're indian or chinese, moving to toronto/vancouver are no-brainers right now. if we can make the rest of the country more appealing, maybe those cities will see less pressure in the long term.

so, like...come on. 5 suggestions, just off the top of my head, with varying degrees of detail. none of which are \"basically zero\", and that's before even talking about public housing which is totally viable for people in certain situations and an area we used to succeed, but have failed miserably at for a generation. many of these would be entirely within the scope of the federal government's jurisdiction and largely compatible with liberal doctrine and ideology. if only they were to bother investing some intellectual and rhetorical energy.",liberals

for example, a few years ago i was sick with a cough so bad that i felt i had to see a doctor right away, and went to the local hospital in the middle of the night. despite sitting in the waiting room for several hours, i'm fairly certain we didn't see a single person call in to be looked over. it wasn't a great population of people in the room, either. i'm not even sure if there was anyone on duty besides the nurses. i ultimately didn't get to see anyone that night, but fortunately i was able to see my family doctor late the next day because i was fortunate enough to have one and he squeezed me in at the end of his normal day.

but, the thing is, the overall examination didn't take much time at all (maybe no more than 20 minutes, although he did refer me to get an xray, which i was able to get a few days later). i can't help but think that there wasn't a lot to the examination, and i can't help but think it could have been performed by a nurse of some sort. such a nurse, or set of nurses, could have easily cleared that backlog that night, imo, especially if most of the cases were like mine. 

we absolutely need more doctors, but i also wonder if we don't need to essentially rethink how we approach who gives the health care. recently in ns, pharmacists were empowered to diagnosis and treat tick bites, for example, and i suspect a lot of basic stuff you might find yourself going to the hospital for late at night, like i did, is stuff that most medical professionals, even if they're not doctors, probably could diagnosis and potentially treat.",liberals

in other words, if there are 100 people needing care, and we have only a public system, that means that those 100 will need to wait to get care. if we have a public and private system (maintaining the current public capacity), that means that there is a possibility of some going to private providers (let's say 20), thus reducing the wait times in the public system (which now only needs to serve 80).

i think you've got this exactly backwards. the basic idea of conventional macro is that the main tool is the interest rate, while fiscal policy takes a backseat if it has any role at all. this means that the response to a recession is to lower rates or engage in qe. this flood of cheap capital is what drives up asset prices, but it doesn't really drive cpi - food prices aren't really dependent on the interest rate, for example. asset prices are not part of inflation. this cheap capital is a big part of what is driving exploding home prices. but just to repeat, this isn't mmt, it's a 100% conventional approach.

mmt, by contrast, is almost the inverse of this. rather than relying on interest rates, they make fiscal policy a central macroeconomic tool. mmt says that we should set the interest rate at a level that is good for investment - low enough that capital is relatively available, but not so low that we create asset bubbles. meanwhile, fiscal policy picks up the slack and plays a much more active role in macroeconomic stabilization. concretely, this means that rather than providing cheaper mortgages to stimulate the economy, we might do something like direct payments to people (eg $1400 cheques).

so, if the government was actually following a more mmt or functional finance approach, it would have kept interest rates higher, while relying more on fiscal programs to stimulate the economy. in my opinion, this would be a better balance for most everyone.

&gt;liberals or the ndp seem to care. somehow wealth inequality isn't even a  subject. so where do you turn if you want the government to do  something?

imo the liberals have thrown fuel on this fire with things like shared equity, but the ndp? their platform is good, it has increased capital gains inclusion rate and a promise to build half a million affordable homes (5x the liberals). perhaps too moderate for my tastes, but it would be a legitimately huge step up for the feds.",liberals

on the third and final hand, it does strike me, from my amateurish point of view, that supports for the working class have been more material, and supports for visible minorities have been more symbolic. my politics hedge a bit more towards reversing that. trying to tangibly dismantle structural racism and shutting down woke people who seem to enjoy a touch too much slamming people without a university degree as \"mediocre\".",liberals

gm0kcw4,2021-02-04T02:09:32.000-08:00,"is canada really safe from trumpism? to be honest, i would be more worried if canada takes policies from reagan democrats (e.g., bush(s), clinton, obama, biden) than worried about \"trumpism\". i think trump is the symptom of the amalgamation of factors that caused by the \"reagan\" democrats.

the reason why trump won the last time is due to the lack of people-led policies (e.g., m4a, 15 dollar minimum wage, climate change, etc), corruption (e.g., [pied piper strategy to elevate trump](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/fileid/1120/251), clinton's emails, etc) and the policies that were implemented by previous administrations that does not impact many americans directly.

in the past 30+ years, the neoliberal policies that politicians implemented does not directly affect majority of americans ([according to a princeton's study](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf)). democrats cozying up with wall street doesn't help. with the combination of these factors i mentioned above, led to the rise of trump's trumpism.

many canadians like barack obama even though he is an [80's style republican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677elagisku) and that is somewhat makes me worried that someday we may have politicians that are similar to trump. off-topic, there are similarities between justin trudeau and barack obama that could lead to a trump-like canadian politician. trudeau is our obama in terms of branding as a face for progressives with a neoliberal agenda. that's my take. let me know if you have questions or concerns with my analysis/take.

when sloan made a mccarthyite accusation against dr. theresa tam (questioning her loyalty to canada) in april 2020, a range of conservative mps spoke against him, from michelle rempel garner to michael chong. since the cpc leadership race was on, and o'toole knew he needed sloan and lewis's social-conservative votes to defeat mackay, he defended sloan (as did mackay). in retrospect that looks like an opportunistic mistake on o'toole's part.

i think sloan has a point in saying that the donation from paul fromm is more of a pretext. people make donations online. it's not like paul fromm came up to him, identified himself, and handed him the donation. (the reason it came to light is that pressprogress has been tracking fromm, and came across his donation in the records released by elections canada.) once sloan found out, he immediately returned the donation.

my guess is that o'toole is committed at this point, and goes ahead with the expulsion, but it's a bit messy. the flimsiness of the justification will alienate some of sloan's supporters within the party.

&gt; sloan said it's absurd to believe that any leadership candidate, or any mp, should be familiar with the names of every single one of their donors.
&gt;
&gt; fromm's total donation of $131 was made aug. 7, just weeks before the contest ended. of that, sloan's campaign received $117.90, with the party taking the rest.
&gt; 
&gt; sloan said fromm donated to his campaign using the name \"frederick p. fromm,\" further obscuring the source of the funds. 
&gt; 
&gt; he said the party would have checked the name at the time, and never raised a red flag then, nor did anyone do so when  fromm's mail-in ballot would have come in.

(it's not just biden's upcoming decision: it's been blocked in us courts for quite a while.)

if and when alberta decides to diversify, ottawa should of course be equally willing to provide funding to help with the transition. the biggest announcement along these lines was the $2.4 billion for cleaning up orphaned oil and gas wells.

april 2020: [ottawa provides $2.4-billion to clean up orphan oil and gas wells in western canada](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-announces-17-billion-to-clean-up-orphan-oil-wells-in-western/).

similarly, there's reports that alberta and ottawa are working on a coordinated strategy for hydrogen (which can be produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage, so-called blue hydrogen).

another area where ottawa can help is with long-distance transmission lines between bc and alberta. [mark jaccard and blake shaffer](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-alberta-bc-electricity-bridge-interties-1.5848042).

tech is another opportunity for diversification - with real estate prices soaring in vancouver, calgary and edmonton should be able to attract tech companies to set up offices there. but it seems like the alberta government has shot itself in the foot with its [cuts to funding for post-secondary institutions](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-budget-2020-advanced-education-funding-cut-6-3-per-cent-tuition-to-rise); good post-secondary institutions producing a steady flow of new grads are a key consideration for tech employers.

other recent federal aid to alberta:

may 2020 - [federal large employer program provides lifeline for companies shut out of bond markets](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-federal-large-employer-program-provides-lifeline-for-companies-shut/). \"since the crisis began, the bond market has remained largely closed to lower-rated companies, whose bonds are referred to as 'high-yield.' only one issuer, real estate company cominar reit, has sold a high-yield bond in canada in recent months, mr. brown said, and that was at a steep price. other deals, particularly for energy exploration and production companies, were scrapped altogether.\"

august 2020 - [alberta government to allow school boards to choose how to spend $250 million in federal funding for covid-19 costs](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/education-minister-to-announce-how-alberta-will-spend-federal-safe-school-funding).

november 2020 - [cap on fiscal stabilization program tripled](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/december-2020/are-fiscal-stabilization-reforms-a-slap-in-the-face-or-a-modernization/). this is an insurance program for an unexpected drop in provincial revenue, with partial coverage for resource revenues. under the previous low cap, alberta was limited to $250 million per year; the federal government just tripled the cap, increasing alberta's share to $750 million per year.

no doubt two doses are better than one. that is not even a question. the question is, is it better to quickly vaccinate everyone with one dose or make sure everyone double doses quickly to maximise individual immunity. evidence from ltc home infection rates show that even single doses make a huge difference - even if they're not ideal. ultimately, i don't know which is more effective. the article is silent on this question, as it simply fantasises about a magical world with infinite doses or one where the feds were able to jump ahead of countries with vaccine manufacturing to get all the doses they could use immediately.

that's the second problem.

the liberals cannot simply yell \"hulk smash!\" and seize vaccines in other countries. the conservative position that we need to put canada first and maximise our vaccine intake does not mesh well with their surprised pickachu face on discovering that other countries were thinking the exact same thing for themselves. 

it's also kind of silly to think that justin trudeau and co. are \"ignoring the science.\" they have their own government of canada scientists telling them what to do. sometimes they're wrong, but what the heck are they going to do about it? even the doctors and scientists in cabinet aren't epidemiologists. 

finally, conspicuous by its absence is any discussion of the governments who actually distribute that vaccination doses and who control who is eligible for which dose when. 

health canada can set minimum standards for pharmaceuticals, no doubt. but nothing stops the provincial governments from prioritising double-dose immunity over single dose immunity.

the provinces have set their own vaccination priorities, informed by their own scientific advice. granted, some of those provinces summarily and systematically ignore that advice, but there's little trudeau can do about that without tearing up the constitution.

for whatever reason, the provincial governments have decided to prioritise mass single dose application over smaller populations getting double doses. perhaps the author could spend some effort asking why, if they were ever curious about anything other than how to try to complain about trudeau.

wave 2 should have been a perfect time for the feds to step in and set minimum standards. the opc is still doing it. yesterday's conference outright showed that lessening of restrictions showed an increase in case count and an overload in hospitalizations.

so they announced an lessening of restrictions.

opc has been late to react every time. the point of the lock-downs was supposed to be to prevent numbers from getting carried away. not as a reaction to the numbers already getting carried away and people dying. 

they have ignored public health guidance from dozens of municipal health leaders. they have even ignored it from their own health leaders. \"open for business\" doesn't care if people are dropping dead.

ford only reacted when public pressure showed a massive decline in his popularity. and even then, he still waited till after christmas to enforce strict lock-downs despite the growing numbers since september

i can't speak to the other province, but ontario's government has absolutely been a public health threat on it's own due to it's behaviours (and the list would be way too long right now)

substantively, i think there would have been some light between the pandemic policies-as-proposed by the liberals and a hypothetical ndp response. counting on landlords to do the right thing with regard to rent subsidies springs to mind. i think the lpc tends to be more trusting of the capital class than the average ndp voter is comfortable with. (more generally, see also p3s.)

i can agree that most of the changes introduced by the ndp were tweaks to generally good (as seen by an ndp voter) policies. there was definitely *some* filling in of holes, but *mostly* it was less idealogical differences and more about having more eyes on policy that needed to be rolled out quickly. i'm personally quite glad that the ndp and lpc were mostly on the same page, and equally glad that the ndp was able to bring light to some of the issues that arose.

the ndp also provides a voice for policy that is more left of the lpc. without that balance, the lpc would only need to focus on countering cpc policy, dragging the entire conversation rightwards. if the cpc is the lpc's antagonist, the ndp is their conscience.

the lpc also serves as a foil for the ndp.  similar to how the pcs of old allowed the liberals to focus on important policy differences between the parties, rather than the current dynamic. in my ideal canpoli world, the cpc would be irrelevant and the lpc - with similar positions to today - would be the rightmost option, and the ndp and lpc could get on with arguing about policy.",liberals
gra2vrc,2021-03-17T06:52:36.000-07:00,"u.s and them — march 17, 2021 the netherlands is having an election today. the election was triggered by the resignation of the entire cabinet over a child benefits scandal, but mark rutte and vvd don't seem to have been hurt by it.

the netherlands uses a pure-pr system - seats are awarded based on national party vote-share. due to this, and an exceptionally low threshold of 0.67% to gain representation (1 seat), the number of parties competing in the election is an impressive 37. it is likely that around 15 of these will gain representation in parliament. the system may seem chaotic to canadian sensibilities, but dutch politics seems to function reasonably well despite it.

in any case, vvd (liberals - centre-right) will likely win the election by capturing 30-40 of the 150 seats. they'll need at least two coalition partners. the second-largest party is the pvv (party for freedom) who currently hold 20 seats (13%). this is a right-wing nationalist party with overtly racist views. as such, rutte has ruled out a coalition with the pvv.

it's likely the current coalition of the vvd, cda (christian democrats) and d66 (democrats 66) will return to power. however, they'll need at least one other partner, probably the pvda (labour), the sp (socialists), the gl (greenleft) or the current fourth wheel, the cu (christian union).

the method of assembling a coalition is quite interesting, the parliament appoints an elder statesman known as the *informateur,* who explores the possible coalition options with the parties. it usually takes a month or two for a governing coalition to emerge and the parliament to sit once again.

rutte is generally regarded as a pragmatic leader, more interested in power than ideology, so he will probably continue to manage his coalition with skill. unfortunately, at the eu level he has been a bit of a spoiler, becoming the unofficial leader of the 'frugal refuseniks', a group of tiny countries who oppose eu fiscal measures even when merkel/germany is in support. the eu contradiction of a monetary union without a fiscal union has proven to be highly dysfunctional, and the return of rutte will not make resolving it any easier. somewhat unhelpfully, he is also a rather unconvincing villain, wielding a cheerful demeanour and bicycling everywhere.

edit: current vote count

|party|seats|change|
|:-|:-|:-|
|vvd (centre-right liberals)|35|\\+2|
|d66 (progressive liberals)|23|\\+4|
|pvv (right-wing nationalist)|17|\\-3|

i am fiscally conservative and socially liberal (and largely identify with conservativism). for me i feel it isn't a contradiction because of many factors.

for example, i believe the government has a role in ensuring access to pharmacare. i don't think it should be the federal government; health care is a provincial responsibility and it should fall to them. further, using the same example, i would support a provider-of-last-resort program along with policies and procedures that encouraged higher workplace unionization, encouraged workplaces to offer their own comprehensive plans, and enable regulations that allow community-managed plans. 

i see this as fiscal conservatism because i don't want the government to be larger and the government should provide programs to help those who can't help themselves. 

i think conservatism in canada gets a bad rap because the conservative party of canada, and the provincial parties espousing conservatism, are such god awful horrible, and are more often invest in owning the libs, than political philosophy. also the fact that the political spectrum in canada has shifted so far to the right that identifying as a red tory, generally means voting ndp today.",conservatives

gt5i4e5,2021-04-02T02:05:39.000-07:00,"the biden plan and the trudeau precedent &gt;it’s a bit of a theological question which country will be spending faster, relative to the total size of the economy, if biden’s plan passes. it depends on how much of each government’s plan you count as “infrastructure,” how much as “social,” how much as “green,” and so on.

i found this passage really interesting because the underlying idea is that the two governments are being compared on who is moving faster to spend money and address major social problems. this seems like such a fundamental shift from previous eras, where governments were more likely to be compared on 'fiscal responsibility'. it's subtle, but it feels like some combination of the great recession, donald trump and covid have broken the neoliberal conception of government. things that were impossible leftist demands ten years ago are now centrist policy and people are looking to the state to address social problems, where before the sentiment \"government is the problem, not the solution\" seemed to rule. rather, it seems the era of the \"the era of big government is over\" is over.

if we've had a spiritual awakening on these issues however, out actual government is lagging behind:

&gt;the prime minister’s 2015 income-tax hike on the top 1 per cent of income earners probably polled well but it had a negligible effect on revenues. these remain, in the sixth year of the trudeau era, within a point of where they stood under stephen harper as a share of gdp—that is, lower than at any point since the early 1960s. 

solving big problems needs big money and the trudeau government has done more tax cutting than raising. we need to increase the fiscal capacity of the state to address these issues, something biden seems more aware of than trudeau.",liberals

trudeau says they \"shook up\" the department which completely failed in the implementation of phoenix.  when in reality every incompetent manager which played a part in suppressing the red flags being raised were simply shuffled to other positions.

macdonald was a genocidal and drunken loon; borden actively tried and succeed in rigging an election he was going to win anyways; meighans only contribution is the outcome of the byng king affair; bennett (and conservatism as a whole) was just woefully unqualified to steer a nation through the depression; diefenbaker, while i have my beefs with him, his government was actually pretty huge for setting the stage for the liberalization of canada under pearson; and harper is harper. we all remember him.

mulroney for what it’s worth did semi-successfully hold his caucus of reformists mps and red tories together for longer than any other leader could have. they were gaining strength but he managed to still be more red tory than full on reform/thatcherite/reaganseque pm. he at least tried to fix some of the failure of our constitutional framework that lingered (and were created by) 1982s reforms, and the gst is one of the major policies that enabled the chrétien and martin governments to eliminate the debt and run some massive surpluses. of course they made major mistakes by cutting tax rates by over 100 billion in revenues, which could have been used to fund universal pharmacare and childcare programs like they originally promised. not using that opportunity to expand much needed services and instead opt for very short term support for up coming election seasons was a major failure of those governments and i don’t think i’ll ever be able to forgive them for that. canada would be in a much stronger fiscal position if they had reinvested the surpluses rather than spend it on tax cuts, but that’s neoliberalism for you. 

i went a little of the rails there lol, but yeah. mulroney’s not the worst. but he’s not exactly up against strong competition. tory pms have historically sucked and have not been individuals with much of any vision for canada. and those that had a vision, were active architects of genocide.",conservatives

gwffnnl,2021-04-30T00:22:58.000-07:00,"ndp puts universal basic income back on the agenda &gt;i'd just say that first off a ubi model doesn't necessitate the government printing out a bunch of money to the point of inflation, it entirely depends on how the government allocates the cash for the project.

fair. but the funds have to come from somewhere. what do we cut? if we don't cut, we have to print.

i'd be hesitant to cut other existing welfare programs because then that gives fiscal conservatives just one very expensive system to target when they get into power. makes their job of austerity easier. the alberta advantage goes into this and argues that building individual basic service systems that people are deeply invested in and are hard to dismantle could be a better approach long term.

&gt; when you give people more money, they tend to spend it. it's an established principle that societies which become less-poor tend to consume more. 

my point is that we would be consuming more without producing more. if we print more money without producing more goods, the value of money decreases. as you said, depends on the model.
 
&gt;again it depends on your model. a progressive ubi - essentially friedman's nit - that taxes the ubi in accordance with someones income, with them earning the entire payment at no income, and gradually seeing it reduce as they earn more, would see the amount paid out by the government change depending on the economic circumstances.

that wouldn't be \"universal\", but again a fair point. still doesn't solve the potential inflationary risk, but as we've agreed that risk depends on the funding model.


&gt;the problem i have with a jobs guarantee is that it just seems inefficient. people in need of a job really need money to stay financially secure while they find work. just giving them cash so they can stay financially secure gives them the freedom to hunt for a job that best fits their talents and means, and pressures businesses to offer competitive wages since workers won't be desperate to take the first shit-paying job they can find to keep food on the table.

my issue is once again increased spending without increased production. i'd rather spend on getting people producing, and those that can't work can be provided basic services to meet their needs (delivered by those we are employing).

&gt;a job guarantee means the government needs to match individuals to jobs that suit them. now if they're just offering a job placement service that could be well and good, the state helping employers find workers is a fine idea. but what if there isn't any such matches? a job guarantee means that the government will get you a job, regardless of what your qualifications are and what the demand for them is. the government pushing people into positions they aren't qualified for or interested in, or creating pointless jobs, just seems much less efficient than giving them money to hold themselves over while searching for work on their own terms.


once again all good points. i agree it's not ideal to give people make work, but many people will find jobs they find fulfilling. we also benefit as a society from the infrastructure they build, the schools, hospitals, and nationalized industries they staff, the manufactured goods and energy they produce, and the services they provide. many people would find it meaningful to provide for the needs of others. others will settle until they find something meaningful to them. those that can't or are unwilling to work can access basic services. i wish i had an answer that completely solves the issue, but i don't think ubi solves the problem of meaningful work either.",conservatives

the proposal i've seen would entail cutting most federal transfers to the provinces except the lower-earning provinces and the territories, with a phase-in plan for those provinces to recover that lost transfer income with a new plan such as boosted pst or a land tax. it'd also consolidate pretty much all existing transfers to individuals outside of child tax credits and carbon tax rebates into the ubi/nit. 

&gt; i'd be hesitant to cut other existing welfare programs because then that gives fiscal conservatives just one very expensive system to target when they get into power.

possibly, but i think that a system that directly impacted so many people with such blatant benefits (getting money every month) would be political suicide to tangle with. most other forms of welfare or universal aid have their positive impacts go unseen by those who aren't directly benefitting, but a program that transferred cash monthly to everyone under a certain income threshhold would be hard for most to turn a blind eye to. 

&gt; my point is that we would be consuming more without producing more. if we print more money without producing more goods, the value of money decreases. as you said, depends on the model.

increased consumption = increased production. if there is increased demand for goods and services because people have more money to spend, there will be a need for more productive enterprises to satisfy that demand. new shops to sell goods, new workers at said jobs and warehouses, new services pandering to more people with money to spend, etc. 

&gt; once again all good points. i agree it's not ideal to give people make work, but many people will find jobs they find fulfilling.

some would, but others would not. i just find it impractical for the government to find a good fit for everyone, and generally think individuals are much better at finding work that best fits their likes and skills themselves. their only hindrance is a lack of financial stability when job hunting that pressures them to take whatever they can get, which is solved with a guaranteed income.",conservatives

trudeau/liberals *did* legislate in paid sick days... for federally regulated employees, you know the ones under its jurisdiction. its up to the provinces to regulate the employers within its own province (which covers the vast majority of employees).

in december 2020, they released their updated climate plan (with the carbon tax going to $170/tonne and various other new policies), and said the modeling for that plan would achieve 31% reductions by 2030 (these are the projections you've linked to, later in your comment).

then in their budget this week, they said the budget's additional billions of funding (clean tech and stuff) and alignment with the new us administration (assuming they ramp up their regulations, i think?) would get canada to 36% reductions by 2030.

the industrial system is a similar concept to the consumer rebates, except the rebates are based on how much product they produced, and it's basically calculated before they pay.  so if a company is 10-20% cleaner than their industry average, they might not have to pay at all, whereas if a company is higher-emitting than their industry average, they could end up paying a lot in carbon tax.  it depends how they compare to the industry benchmark (90% for oil and gas, as you mention, or 80% for some others).",liberals

gvkl8wa,2021-04-23T00:46:04.000-07:00,"judge rules key federal sex work laws unconstitutional these kinds of ruling make it clear that the legal system doesn't care for sex trafficking victims. it only favours the tiny percentage of women that voluntarily go into the trade and can actually take advantage of these laws. the majority of women in the trade are victims that are kept there through violence and coercion. they don't have the ability to run away, or choose their clients or conditions. 

it's perplexing how a movement built on the idea of helping silenced voices and marginalized groups is so keen on ignoring just such a group in favour of a smaller vocal minority. rulings like this, coupled with the liberals desire to sunset the revised prostitution laws in the criminal code make it clear they have no interest in helping trafficking victims. there's no point in giving them the ability to make safer work conditions for themselves when they literally don't have the power to do so. 

and some people will say, well legalization and legislating better working conditions can lead to better enforcement. it doesn't. germany and the netherlands have gone the legalization route - and in the netherlands especially, law enforcement now can't successfully identify and rescue trafficking victims because all of the establishments look the same (i.e. they all look like legal ones). it's ridiculously easy for traffickers to game the system to set up a legal front to pass any inspections while proceeding with trafficking women from eastern europe and north africa.

this paper frames the netherlands experience very well:  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260493897\\_the\\_challenges\\_of\\_fighting\\_sex\\_trafficking\\_in\\_the\\_legalized\\_prostitution\\_market\\_of\\_the\\_netherlands](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260493897_the_challenges_of_fighting_sex_trafficking_in_the_legalized_prostitution_market_of_the_netherlands) 

a key theme is that the legal definition drives the enforcement approach - if it's legalized, the focus is on checking for appropriate licensing (the paper notes many of these establishments are not being scrutinized for tax fraud, so the the idea that legalized establishments pay taxes can be misleading), and the paper also identifies how easy it is for a trafficking operation to receive one of these licenses. 

if we want to help both groups - the voluntary sex workers and the trafficking victims, we need a policy and legal approach that helps both at the same time. i'm interested to hear what that system could look like, but so far, it doesn't appear as if full legalization is it, since it's too easy to game.",liberals

hcbv02q,2021-09-10T02:26:21.000-07:00,"discussion thread - election 2021: the leaders' debate thank you for your compliment. it is good to see rational conversation is still alive and well on the internet. 

as far as being a small c, i am in the same boat currently. socially i’m rather left, fiscally i’m more centre right. right now for me, fiscal responsibility is something i value highly.  if inflation takes off again(which it is) we’re going to have to have a major recession or a major interest rate hike like in the 1980s. which will bring a whole new pain to the country. i realize covid has a huge part of the inflation and it is not entirely trudeaus fault.  however fiscal policy has always been the trudeau governments weak point. 

as far as your divisiveness comment i 100% agree. the fact that jagmeet singh says he’s all for inclusion and diversity, and then calls for the exclusion of  bernier, it is hypocritical at best and absolutely divisive.  this one issue alone is enough for me to not vote for the ndp again. if you want to call yourself inclusive that means everyone even people you disagree with politically. 

we need to return to moderate politics. i think a conservative minority would be the best fit for canadians right now. we have the benefit of having minority governments the actually hold the ruling party accountable. (which i feel is superior than the us system).  

i firmly believe politics is like a pendulum, it swings left and right, and it always needs to swing. if it gets pulled too hard to one side it will always swing back, and the consequences will be more severe (conservative majority, which i do not want). 

thanks again for the comment.",liberals
hcbv0z7,2021-09-10T02:26:31.000-07:00,"the farce of canada’s televised federal leader’s debate is an insult to viewers and voters i completely disagree. having gotten to speak to my local reps both during this election and during covid, it makes a big difference. when your mp pats themselves on the back and says what a good job they did when you tell them you can’t pay your rent, that matters. you need reps who listen to what’s happening on the ground, not just in small towns but also in large cities. they are your personal point of contact to the federal government and if they don’t listen to the community they are less than worthless.

i’m not taking a stance on strategic voting in this thread - honestly i flip-flop on how useful it is, but voting for the pm is useless if you don’t know your local riding. what good is it to vote for a liberal government. (for example) when your local riding is a toss up between the conservatives and ndp. you have to know your local riding if you want your vote to have any impact.

i am going to push back on to it last statement. even if your mp isn’t in the majority party, they can be part of a strong opposition which is especially useful in a minority government. (which it looks like we are heading toward)

and if they are really good - they can drive the national conversation by making the issue news.
