h5vkurq,2021-07-20T00:13:18.000-07:00,"rex murphy: cubans deserve our support, but the left would rather embrace murderous dictators * the full extinction of human rights on that small island seemed to raise little objection from many people in the united states and canada. castro himself, though a dictator, was seen as something of a hero in our comfortably democratic countries. his version of communism was somehow the benevolent kind, stripped of its innate cruelties, its arbitrariness, its secret police and suspension of personal liberties.
* the trudeaus were family friends. upon castro’s death, alexandre trudeau wrote what is probably the most fatuous eulogy in the history of that saccharine genre. i have room for just the barest sample: “his intellect is one of the most broad and complete that can be found. he is an expert on genetics, on automobile combustion engines, on stock markets, on everything.… combined with a herculean physique and extraordinary personal courage, this monumental intellect makes fidel the giant that he is.”
* try telling that to the cuban people he repressed for 45 years, and who still suffer under communist rule. of course now, the cuban people appear to have finally found the nerve to say that they wish to have the rights and freedoms we take for granted. “we are not afraid” and “freedom” are their protest cries, along with “patria y vida” (“homeland and life”).
* it surely cannot be too much to ask that the cuban people receive support and encouragement in their struggle against a tyrannical and repressive regime from people in countries like canada who enjoy the very freedoms that cubans are now demanding.
* a country that so prides itself on its charter of rights and freedoms, and that is governed by the son of the man who introduced that charter, should surely be vocal in demanding the end of a dictatorship, the abandonment of communism and the rights of the people to govern themselves.",liberals

simple political fact is this: naturalized citizens have *always* made up a large proportion of the population. right now it is around 20%; it was around the same proportion in the early 1900s when the west was opening up. even our first prime minister was born in glasgow.

any political party that is *completely* against immigration is dead in the water. you can't ignore that large a voting block. it is about *how* you manage immigration that is important. thankfully, canadians are fairly united on that front as well: they want immigration to serve the interests of the state.

we invented the idea of a points-based system in the late 1960s, and it has continued in various forms up to the present day, with every government making iterative improvements. immigrants should primarily be selected based on skill and their ability to integrate and contribute to the economy.

h5vrxda,2021-07-20T01:05:06.000-07:00,"trudeau says he would support a criminal investigation into residential schools people need to be very careful what they ask for.  a criminal case against the goc would be ugly and likely would not go in the direction most people assume it would.  there would not be anyone sent to jail and the government of canada and churches would be found not guilty which would pour gas on the fire. for the crown to prove the accused is guilty the actus reus and mens rea must be proven. not be any stretch of the imagination is this feasible in the year 2021.

the other issues is that thus far we are only telling one side of the story. like all stories there are 2 sides. if a trial ever happened the accused would have to mount a defense and that defense would not be pretty.  the residential school system, in hindsight, was a flawed policy but that doesn't mean that it was flawed from the beginning.  19th century policy makers (davin, macdonald, ryerson, et al) thought that \"killing the indian\" was their best option for saving the kids from pending doom.

and let's not kid ourselves here folks.  things are still not good on the reserves. even in 2021, if growing up on a reserve you have a better chance of ending up in jail than graduating from high school.  indigenous people in canada represent less than 5% of the population yet 50% of children in foster homes are indigenous.  that means forcefully removed from their homes.  it is not like life is rosy on the reserves today.

1. i agree that there is nothing inherently wrong with religion when in moderation.  the problem really comes when you follow the scriptures too closely.  anti-abortion, anti-women's rights, anti-lgbt, etc.
1. your opinion on this specifically feels weak \"it doesn't protect every case so it's bad\", a bit like saying helmets don't protect your knees so what's the point of them if it doesn't protect everything.  like i said earlier, in my opinion, it is a step in the right direction, it isn't perfect (let's be honest it never will be). it doesn't cover everything, but it gets us closer. i think the only way it impacts mostly minorities is that minorities cling to their religion a lot more closely, and if you want a public servant role, you have to leave the signs at home.  i mean if you wear a headscarf and want to work in construction you'll need to wear the helmet as protective gear, what is this person going to do with their headscarf?  i don't think a dress code for a job is quite normal.
1. this argument \"what's a religious sign anyway?\" is the only thing that i completely agree with that is against the bill. i think it's very ambiguous.  it is really hard to find a definitive description of what even is religion or how we recognize them.  does it need 1 000 followers? 5 000? 100 000? the case of the [pastafarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flying_spaghetti_monster) is an interesting one.  it is a \"satire\" religion,  they encourage you to wear a colander on your head, so do we ban head colanders? 
1. like i said earlier, i think it is much more difficult to fire public servants for bias or intents than it is to have a barrier at entry.  not everyone is as comfortable as you with religion. i think that someone displaying religious signs can lead to problems and we should try to minimize that.

quebec has a very specific relationship with religion with the \"révolution tranquille\" and the role of religion in everyone's home before then.  i think the abuse from religious entities makes it that people don't align with religion at all.  even though statistically the population mostly says they are christian but when i talk with people, the response i get is a lot more about they do not know where they are in the religious realm than it is about christianity.  don't believe in god, but something is out there

&gt;a spokesperson for diversity and inclusion minister bardish chagger confirmed that **both the antisemitism and islamophobia summits** will be held this summer.

also what do you mean by \"inexistant\"? according to the [stats canada report](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2021001/article/00002-eng.htm) from 2019:

&gt;hate crimes targeting the black and jewish populations remained the most common types of hate crimes, representing 18% and 16% of all hate crimes, respectively. as well, hate crimes targeting sexual orientation accounted for 14% of all hate crimes.

i agree with you and others that criticism of the israeli government is not antisemetic. i also agree with jenica atwin's comments on apartheid. however, that doesn't mean that antisemitism, separate from that, isn't also a problem or that we should ignore it. we can have an antisemitism summit without it meaning we accept what the israeli govt is doing. 

there is certainly an issue where some people act as if all criticism of israel is antisemitic but there also seem to be some that assume antisemitism doesn't exist and anyone who comments on it is in support of the israeli govt's actions in palestine. both these groups are incorrect. the israeli govt is committing apartheid and should be criticized but actual antisemitism does also exist and should be addressed.

the cause of this is because the immigrants tend to be urbanites or suburbanites in their home country. if you're a farmer, you're very much tied to the land and may not even be able to move town, let alone move to another country because you won't have a land to farm there and the knowledge you have may not necessarily transfer well to the new country.

if you take a suburbanite and put them in a new country, there's a high chance that they'll live in the suburb again especially if that suburb area has people that come from the same country as you and share the same culture and language. and that's why the new immigrants tend to stick to big cities.

these 'fringe' parties in a proportional system would create debates and alliances in the house of commons which are accurate to how the country's electorate actual feels. as in a democracy, its up to the other parties to debate the accuracy and practicality of any policy idea.

&gt;what's to stop an ontario party from dominating everything since they will probably need to be included in almost any coalition to get legislation passed?

they already do. the ontario party is called the liberals. 

&gt;with national parties they have to balance regional interests to keep getting support across regions.  so even if ontario is the most important province, sometimes the national party has to look for interests in bc, or the maritimes, etc.

and they would have people to talk to with the bc bloc. 

&gt;note: i am not in favour of fptp.  i want a different system, but i do have some concerns about the side-effects of some other potential systems.  i already think having strong regional parties is bad for national unity.  having the bloc only worried about quebec is a problem.  a govt run by the liberals with little or no representation in the prairies is a problem.  etc.

canada is a problem. regional “blocs” is my favorite alternative if we want to keep the country but iʼd much rather have an alliance of sovereign nations banding together over their common interests and not having any region trying to rule another.",liberals

*wow! imagine that! didn't we hear about this the first time they came to power?*

&gt;*trudeau said, however, that he would not favour proportional representation as an alternative, saying the system “gives more weight to smaller parties that are perhaps fringe parties.”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*trudeau instead expressed his preference for a ranked-ballot system, saying such an approach contributes to less divisive elections.*

the whole point of electoral reform is to ensure fringe parties, like the greens, ppc, maverick, or whatever smaller parties don't yet exist, can get *some* representation in parliament without risking a bad option getting elected. (personal preference is mmp)

in trudeau's proposed system, you'd get eternal liberal supermajorities unless every single ndp and cpc voter didn't put the liberals as their second (or third) choice. he'd legislate himself king. only thing saving us is that every electoral reform referendum i've heard about has failed (bc, ontario, new brunswick, quebec, prince edward island), so i don't see this succeed.",liberals

ghost kitchens are restaurants that operate with very low overhead by renting a kitchen and selling food only through online services. they end up being more profitable, and employees are happier as they're not interacting with the public. they've been slow to take hold because municipal and provincial regulatory barriers exist to operating a kitchen without seating.

not unlike the struggle to license food trucks in, ie, vancouver; where decades of effort were needed to simply allow them to exist.

&gt; we've had taxis (which is what uber h co are) 

yes, we've had taxis for ages; which are not ride sharing services. taxis operate under artificially high overhead in canada due to the byzantine licensing model making taxis cripplingly expensive. the difference is that where taxis exclude low and middle class users, ride sharing exploits low and middle class drivers. ride sharing is still verboten all over canada, and where it's allowed it's typically crippled by regulation.

&gt; \"personal shopper\" is easily handled by delivery services

a personal shopper is, for instance, an instacart shopper. they're employed by the grocer, or other retail outlet, to fill the online purchase orders. canadians just haven't really adopted this sort of service en masse.


meanwhile, we have the grits pushing legislation that will make canada a _toxic_ environment for any company that wants to serve user generated content online. anyone with a comment section, forum, or file upload service of any kind would do well not to have servers or operations of any kind in canada, lest they risk losing _3% of gross revenue_ due to an oversight. it's like canada _hates_ modernization.",liberals

gzf1dt7,2021-05-25T03:58:59.000-07:00,"depressed with options for next election this honestly reads like a whole lot of projection of your viewpoints than what might actually happen.

i'll use a couple of policy examples to illustrate.

climate change/carbon tax. poll after poll says that the majority of gta and lower mainland residents support this.  and support is particularly strong among younger cohorts.  this is very different from the conservative assumption that trudeau would have a stephane dion moment with the carbon tax.  

immigration.  remember harper's parental super visa?  it was good policy.  but that and the dogwhistling \"barbaric practices\" tip line were probably enough to undo all the effort kenney made courting immigrants. in the end, all those supposedly conservative immigrant communities actually went back to the liberals in 2015.  turns out policies do matter.

now project out a decade and guess who is going to occupy most of the suburbs?  a lot of those voters will be millennials, and substantially immigrants.  what would change their views substantially?  i can't see it.  are they suddenly going to stop thinking climate change is important just because they live in the burbs? 

i know people bring up housing affordability.  but even in the gta and gva, most of those suburban residents are homeowners.  and that's likely to be the case a decade from now.  a ton of those immigrant kids are either getting their parents' house or using their parents' equity to enter the market.  the likelihood of this being a deciding factor in any election, is still pretty low.  

moreover, there's huge differences in how families think about pocketbook issues, as opposed to unmarried singles.  there's the $1500/mo for daycare for every child.  there's the $500/mo for go train passes.  etc.  there's a lot more than just paying for house. so i'm not sure talking about housing affordability while also pledging to cut a bunch of things those families also need, is quite the winning combination you think it is.  in particular, the hit from suburban working women (particularly millennial suburban working women) is likely to be substantial. there's already a horrific gender gap.  and it's likely to grow if the party doesn't spend some time thinking about what matters to women.",liberals

they aren't paying rent. they own it. they bought it with the loan given to them, at prime, and paid the property transfer tax. the house was sold at, or slightly below, the assessed value. 

another way is to simply put the family members on the board of the numbered corporation that owns the property, and then have them declare the address as their principal residence.

h6mk2hi,2021-07-26T06:14:54.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] i think the average, long time albertan voter is center right, with allegiance to the oil industry and the conservative brand. they want a strong economy, minimal taxes, but also good public education and healthcare. they probably identify as christian but think government should stay out of social issues. 

the alberta pc's stayed in power for 40 years by keeping these people happy. they used oil money to fund public services without raising taxes or cutting costs aggressively. they stayed out of industry's way to keep the gravy train running, but kept labor happy enough to prevent a serious revolt.

that started breaking down when oil crashed, and government had to start making hard choices. jim prentice became premier during a financial crisis and lit the base on fire by suggesting that a) govt might need to cut services, or b) implement provincial sales tax, and c) albertans had some responsibility for the situation they were in. 

enough of them voted for the ndp in protest that they accidentally elected a 'socialist' government.  most fled back to the ucp as soon as there was a viable conservative option. 


kenney rode to power on a promise to bring back the glory days of oil and gas - when everyone could have their cake and eat it too. but as long as oil is depressed the province faces the same hard choices. voters are forced to make polarizing choices between cutting labor costs, reducing services, running large deficits or paying more tax. 

at the same time they've been grappling with a growing ideological right (going back to the wildrose) threatening to either take over the conservative party, or split the right completely.

we will see if the 'sensible' centre right can adjust to the new reality and settle on a realistic platform. if not, i expect some will move over to the ndp but most will resign themselves to alliance with the extreme right.",conservatives

with this comment, he's denying that price incentives work.  in this framework, if emissions become more expensive (e.g. gas prices go up), people just suck it up and pay the increased price.  a per-capita rebate is then just some sort of fancy communist wealth redistribution scheme.

if prices don't cause people to change their behaviour, then only strings-attached rebates will.

to put it gently, it is bonkers off-the-wall-insane to hear this come from a conservative politician.  the totality of modern economic thought leans heavily on the idea that people pay attention to prices and make the best-for-them choices, which is why the entire idea of a carbon tax and rebate came from right-of-centre circles to begin with.",liberals

not sure what data you're looking at.

https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data/hospitalizations#hospitalizedandicu

look under the \"availability of icu beds\" section, on november 1 we had 133 in icu due to covid, and on december 15 we have 154. so a slight increase, but nowhere near on pace with the fact that our daily new cases has tripled over that same period. over that entire period we'd have around 600 beds available.

&gt;source? ontario health table is saying the opposite.

https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/2/22811901/omicron-variant-origins-timeline-nigeria-cases

guess it was retracted. nigerian health officials were saying they detected it in cases in october.

but other data since from other countries shows that it was still spreading internationally weeks before it was officially \"announced\" in south africa

https://www.rivm.nl/en/news/omicron-variant-found-in-two-previous-test-samples

&gt;yes they are. it's at a reduced rate but with how insanely easy the new variant spreads, all that gain is thrown out the window.

at a much reduced rate. ie. it's killing around 4 people per day in ontario. and has held steady at that rate despite new daily cases tripling.

&gt;the point is you are making assumptions based on what the spread of delta has been like. omicran spreads four times easier.

and even despite that higher spread, icu admissions and deaths aren't increasing. even as daily new cases has tripled over the past 6 weeks, daily deaths have held steady and icu patients have only slightly increased (around 10-15% higher).

&gt;manitoba is projecting 1000 cases a day in a few weeks.

yeah probably. but here's the thing - cases don't actually matter. what matters is hospitalizations, icu admissions, and deaths. all of which have held steady for weeks now, despite the spread of this new variant.",liberals

fully agreed. practically everyone in my high school cohort and their parents had this mentality. i remain grateful my degree choice continued to what i'm currently doing professionally, and there remains plenty of employment to go around.

many friends got various degrees that have nothing to do with what they are now. this is not limited to arts degrees - even engineering disciplines weren't immune, and back in grade 12 job availability was a strong motivation to pursue an engineering program. 

but credit to their determination and work ethic, they found ways to succeed in their own respects. a silver lining of all this is it guides us to a different mentality than our parents when it comes to our own kids, and whether we think forcing them to do a university education is always a good idea.",liberals

i may do this, but it will take some time.

&gt;also you're making a generalization out of a dozen cases over decades out of a million and a half people (indians hindu, muslims, and sikhs; middle eastern people; pakistani; african muslims; asian muslims).

where have i done this?  my statement that most honor killing victims are muslim was not specific to canada.  i was speaking of islam generally (i thought my mention of isis would have made that obvious).

&gt;those incidents are about a certain chauvinist culture rather than a religion. malaysia and indonesia are also muslim but this stuff is very rare there, with their media claiming their first recorded case of a 'honor' killing in 2016.

most muslims don't do honour killings.  but most people that do honour killings are muslim.

&gt;the same style of chauvinist culture also causes things like western domestic partners to murder their spouse and/or children when their marriage doesn't work. a entitlement to a specific idea of honor. but we don't label it with a exotic label. we just call it domestic violence. but it's not that different. it's a selfish desire for their own wants that overrides the right of someone else to live.

i've never heard of a westerner killing their children called \"domestic violence\".  and usually its one western man acting alone, his other male relatives don't all join in.

i'm sure there is also domestic violence in muslim nations.  however, honour killings seem like a whole different beast.",conservatives

yup, since 1980 i would agree that corporations have used a series of complex calculations loopholes to avoid taxes. but go back in time, to say 1952, and coporate tax revenue was 50% of government income. half of income, not 12 or 15 percent, half. it used to be taxed \"excessive profits\" on companies. since the tax code changes through the 1960s to now corporate taxes as a share of government income have been steadily reducing while the share borne by individuals has increased.

https://projects.thestar.com/canadas-corporations-pay-less-tax-than-you-think/

all those charts and opinion pieces focus on a time where real incomes of people were falling and coporate profits were rising. its strange how even though we see these trends in real life, miraculously, the coporate share of revenue never changes. your arguements only serve to reinforce the point that companies are not paying into the system fairly. the above linked study show how very clearly corporate canada has steadily payed less and less as a share of revenue.

i also find it interesting that you linked two recession years and two bumper years in your corporate comparison. so in 1990 and 2000, there were major recessions, 2007 and 2019 were bumper years. so as a percent of federal income they should be dramatically different. corporate revenues increased by almost 20x between 2008 and 2020 but your number show barely a 25% increase. it doesn't prove the tax rate isn't effective, it just shows that companies are doing whatever they can to avoid paying a fair share.",conservatives

i agree

&gt; more government to me means more disparity.

depends what you do. the cpc, lpc, and ndp are all 'big government'. government is as big as it needs to be. what is too big for canada. how can that be measured, it's relative to what people need, and to what we can do.

for now our big focus is disproportionally helping the wealthy, which i can agree with. but this did not start until the ~80's. before then the pendulum was shifting in a way favourable to average people. so there is a way.

our big government now relies on neoliberalism and pushes free-markets while manipulating winners and losers. what is the alternative you want to propose. you are proposing more of the same, a gradual worsening on the path we are on. a path that is leading to the destruction of the planet, something which future generations will actually suffer through and forever pay for.

&gt; so the elites (bankers, ig oil, big pharma, big agra..etc) can manipulate and coerce to get more power.

what is the goal to get this power back, because less government, more privatization, more elites, more concentration of wealth is not the answer. we have 0 ability to hold these groups accountable.

where i do think we can agree is that we need community driven power to put pressure. people's ideas of politics and getting things done is electing people and then yelling at them. there is a limit built into electoral politics and this is intentional.

if we aren't pushing for economic justice, nothing will ever fundamentally improve, as the root cause of problems is the same.",conservatives

you've held up something that you think is poor access, as an acceptable standard for access to another medical procedure that is - generally - a more pressing medical issue on a chronological scale.

for most abortions, despite there being no laws against later term in canada, you really only have a few weeks between confirmation of pregnancy and a close-off point to where doctors will no longer really perform the abortion (for a variety of reasons, both moral and medical).

[nine months to the deadline, but nine weeks to make up your mind,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yemwlwa6bqi) as the song goes. you then have the compounding factor of social stigma - it's relatively easy to say, \"hey, i have a chemo appointment, can you drive me?\" to a family member, or even a close friend, but much harder to say, \"hey, i have an abortion appointment, can you drive  me?\" it *shouldn't* be, but it is, and ignoring it is oversimplifying the issue of access. it means you need to either lie, or pay for a way to get to another city (for what inter-city taxis there are). 

so, short decision and action time, hard to access, social stigma. bad combo. that, in my opinion, makes your statement disingenuous.",conservatives

h77lk9j,2021-07-31T01:26:16.000-07:00,"ndp has wide lead on ucp, but many albertans aren’t committed: poll i'm kind of having a feeling that we might have a couple more elections like this where the ucp and andp trade places every four/five years due to the incumbent government's unpopularity. not that one option isn't clearly better than the other (notley is by far the better option than kenny), but both parties are basically maintaining a hegemony over legislature (with over 85% of the votes and 100% of the seats) while trying to placate to [the somewhat spoiled preferences of the provincial electorate](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-poll-balanced-budget-services-taxes-1.4645693), yet tipping the scale somewhere in the direction that the majority of the electorate doesn't like by either cutting spending, raising taxes or producing sustained deficits for prolonged periods of time without a plan for long term fiscal solvency (all of which garner gigantic electoral backlash). so basically, i see a sustained political limbo/musical chairs session until a government breaks the cycle.

in terms of provincial revenues, even after the 2014/15 commodities crash, we settled to average revenue levels (as a percentage of gdp) for the past 20+ years in 2016, yet spending for the past 5 years (and likely for the next 5 years regardless of who wins the next election) has been about 2 to 2.5% of gdp above revenues. both notley and kenny's government each respectively insisted that overly optimistic royalty revenue projections released by their governments will sustain post 2015 spending, while ruling out a pst, or overall spending reductions to pre 2015 levels. basically telling albertans that royalties will sort everything out without either new taxes or long term spending reductions on services etc. and the electorate has overwhelmingly rewarded them for that by pushing all other parties out of the legislature (including the alberta liberals who actually proposed a pst in 2019 and were rewarded with less than 1% of the vote last election).

in short, the problem is that we've elected representatives that are so dead set on telling the electorate what they want to hear rather that what they need to hear, to the point that they will consciously shield them from a reality where they have to make compromises. for instance, as contradictory as it might sound, it is actually possible for alberta to have lower taxes (at least for the majority of the populace), maintain services and have a balanced budget, but it would require a pst and less reliance on royalties, which albertan's are fundamentally against. so either we go back to late klien era or prentice style budgets (in terms of spending/revenue as a percentage of gdp), we implement a pst, or enact some compromise between those two options to create a longterm pathway to budgetary stability (all of which would work), or we continue our current course and deal with massive debt servicing costs going into the 2030s and 2040s, by which point the incumbent government will have to take draconian measures to put the situation left by it's predecessors under control.

in either case, we (the electorate) as a whole are to blame for this and either ucp and andp leadership have to do better, or we have to elect more honest candidates that will address those issues instead of telling us not to worry about them.

the last point did occur when chrétien/martin had to deal with the debt crisis. the result is chronic underfunding of health care. when it started- we had 50/50 split between feds and provinces. now the feds is only putting in 30%. that probably going down further which means less health care.

the only time doug did well during the pandemic is when he got scared, shut up and regurgitated expert opinions. 

the second he started making decisions again, his incompetence began showing.

that is why you have news articles assuming he is going to screw this up, because that is what any reasonable person would assume he would do based on his previous actions.
