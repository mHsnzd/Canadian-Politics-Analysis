how about the rail blockades at the end of 2019?  remember that?  he did nothing with that regard. covid came in and saved his ass.

what about his ethics violations? 

how about him implying construction workers are all sexist pigs?  

how about how much money he wasted in a failed nato application?  just how many millions did he waste there?

how about that last election run when he used two planes?... one for his clothes.  that was great for the environment. 

how about when he closed parliament during a pandemic to avoid ethics investigation? 

how about when he went on vacation, took the jet back to canada ... for a meeting... then flew back to his vacation. 

how about him calling everyone else racist, yet he's the one with the most racist actions when he was in his early 30s?

how about wasting 3 months with china trying to get vaccines and got nothing?  he  totally ignored our own ability to manufacture vaccines domestically, then came to the table late and had to pay through the nose for vaccines?  we paid 2 to 3 times the amount other countries do. you know that right?  that's our tax money he is wasting. 

how are the two michaels doing?  

he failed on the 5 promises he made. 

how about giving our ppe away?  then spending millions on ventilators that are still not being used.

i don't see how you get to claim government manipulation based on that correlation alone. that's on par with conspiratorial thinking. do you have some other evidence, a government official actually performing a manipulation?


edited to add:


and what exactly was the method of manipulation? did they close testing stations? did they coerce health authorities to relabel covid cases as pneumonia cases? did they publicly report fake numbers?


because here is where the data comes from,



&gt;  data sources: case details and laboratory information are updated daily monday through friday at 4:30 pm. data on cases is collected by health authorities during public health follow-up. total covid-19 cases include laboratory diagnosed cases (confirmed and probable) as well as epi-linked cases... laboratory data is supplied by the b.c. centre for disease control public health laboratory and the provincial lab information solution (plis); tests performed for other provinces have been excluded. critical care hospitalizations are provided by the health authorities to phsa on a daily basis. 

[source](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/b-c-covid-19-cases-by-health-authority)

h9s5omr,2021-08-20T22:28:14.000-07:00,"trudeau to o’toole: pro-choice does not mean the freedom of doctors to choose honestly, because this could be a serious barrier to accessing medical services. once you're outside of a major city, access to healthcare can already be challenging. if you let providers deny services based on religious beliefs, then people seeking abortions might have a harder time getting one if the one doctor near them won't do it. 

and it doesn't stop at abortion. if religious beliefs are grounds for withholding medical care, then what about gender affirming care for trans people or hiv treatment for gay men? can they just refuse to see trans people entirely? these are issues in the us already, and they lead to serious issues with access to healthcare. also, should a jw doctor be able to refuse to give a blood transfusion to someone else?

to be honest, if you're a healthcare professional, you should be treating people to the standard of care regardless of your beliefs or their beliefs. the standard of care in canada includes unfettered access to abortion. if they don't like that (or providing gender affirming care), then they shouldn't be a doctor.

as for the doctor shortage, maybe just raise taxes on the wealthy a bit and pay doctors more",liberals

h9s6218,2021-08-20T22:32:00.000-07:00,"trudeau to o’toole: pro-choice does not mean the freedom of doctors to choose no offence but you don’t really understand how medicine works from a resource availability perspective 

there are different types of doctors and they all do totally different things.  for example a psychiatrist is a doctor, they don’t really have any experience in women’s health (aside from mental health).  your policy would force them to provide abortions?

or even if it’s in the same specialty eg an orthopaedic surgeon might have done added training in hands and only really be experience/comfortable doing hand surgery.  they won’t even necessarily fix someone’s broken hip and that’s fine, they are still doing useful and needed work

as far as abortions in general only obstetricians do surgical abortions (some family doctors do but very few).  

as far as medical abortions they are often done by family doctors but many family doctors don’t feel comfortable medically performing them - they just feel like they don’t know what they are doing in that area.  and actually their licensing colleges would say “if you don’t feel comfortable doing something then dont do it”

so saying every doctor should be obligated to provide abortions really makes no sense just from a “being trained or clinically comfortable in performing abortions”

that’s aside from the fact that obviously doctors should have the right to not perform a procedure they feel morally uncomfortable performing",liberals

most concerting is the desire to vaccinate healthy children, those with natural immunity, and the blocking of off-patent medications because these things can't be justified even with half-baked risk assessments(poor monitoring means proper one is impossible seems criminal to pretend otherwise). all vaccine trials showed it to be of no benefit to people with natural immunity. when the cdc said people with natural immunity should get the shot they gave this nonsensical justification.\"experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from #covid19. get your covid-19 vaccine as soon as you can.\" since the virus has been around longer, we actually have a longer profile for natural immunity. also sars i retained immunity 15 years &amp; protects against covid in spite of a 20% genetic dissimilarity. people will say \"mutants\" as a reason to vax kids but these are leaky vaccines that do no provide sterilizing immunity traditionally arguments of herd immunity &amp; mutation aren't valid. in fact, leaky vaccines in the past have selected towards higher virulence. also potential for antibody-dependent enhancement.

our actual vaccination progress and the fact that we're in a third wave? the fact that we can't produce vaccines ourselves because, for some stupid reason, we decided to deal with a country that holds two of our citizens hostage? no matter how you look at it, the countries who have been able to navigate the third wave effectively are countries that have been successful at integrating themselves in the vaccination production pipeline effectively, something that canada tried but failed miserably at for a incomprehensible geopolitical reason.

&gt; from what i can find online, \"canada was the first country to sign with  moderna and the fourth to sign with pfizer and biontech\". it doesn't  sound like we were \"late to the vaccine race\".

none of them actually trying to integrate themselves in the western supply chain. 

to go back to the topic of this thread and my argument, yes canada could have avoided the third wave, and its not only the provincial government's fault. you're cheerleading pretty hard by stating that the federal government is irreprochable and is not to blame for this third wave, when there are countries who have been able to avoid it completely for reasons that don't involve lock-down politics.",conservatives

gu1vq1e,2021-04-10T01:37:50.000-07:00,"conservatives say new program spending risks canada’s future — unless they’re the ones doing it &gt;but go back in time, to say 1952, and cooperate tax revenue was 50% of government income. half of income, not 12 or 15 percent, half. it used to be taxed \"excessive profits\" on companies. since the tax code changes through the 1960s to now corporate taxes as a share of government income have been steadily reducing while the share borne by individuals has increased.

corporations were much less global and mobile in the 1950s than they were in the past half century. most  were smaller localized industries and globalized markets and multinational corporations were not the norm. global financial markets were also not developed because 90% of the world in 1950 was impoverished (compared to less than 10% living in global extreme poverty today). pretending that corporate taxes can be a significant part of government revenues in a globalized economy is not a realistic or evidence driven assertion.

with the development of global markets, the globalization of financial markets and technological developments, capital and investment have become far more mobile and far more elastic, making them more responsive to taxation. that's not a bad thing, but it does mean that modern tax systems need to evolve to address modern concerns rather than trying to emulate polices from 70 years ago that are not duplicatable today.

additionally arguing that the tax share for individuals has increased since the 1950s-60s is incredibly misleading.  canada's government is considerably larger than it was 70 years ago. as a percentage of gdp, probably at least twice as large as it was in the the early 1950s. there is no way that government could grow that much without the tax share borne by individuals increasing. even if corporate tax revenue as a percentage of gdp stayed the same as it was in the 1950s (around 5-6% of gdp), that would only answer for less than 1 tenth of all revenue growth as a percentage of gdp between then and now.

likewise, that does not mean that the corporate tax system of the 1950s was more efficient. rates of incidence for corporate tax would have still fell on labor resulting in regressive effects. likewise, this didn't actually translate to a higher effective tax rates for the wealthiest earners. for the united states for instance, [the effective rate paid by the top 1% of households hasn't made significant changes since the early 50s](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20170804133536/average-effective-tax-rate-on-the-top-1-percent-of-u.s.-households.png) (the effective rate fluctuating between 35-43% between 1950 and 2020).  the tax systems today are generally much more efficient than the tax systems of the 1950s.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the above linked study show how very clearly corporate canada has steadily payed less and less as a share of revenue.

this is more than a bit disengeious. while revenues declined between 1950 and 1970. effective revenues both as a percentage of gdp and as a percentage of federal revenues in canada have been constant for the past four decades.

&gt;i also find it interesting that you linked two recession years and two bumper years in your corporate comparison.  so in 1990 and 2000, there were major recessions

revenue levels listed for both are revenues prior to the effects of recession [as shown here](https://winteryknight.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/canadacorporatetaxrate.jpg):  revenues peaked at 2% of gdp in 1990  and 2.3% before the recession hit.  revenues in the years i provided were not hindered by the recession. canada's 1989 budget collected $113 billion in revenue compared to $119 billion in 1990. the same is evident between 1999 and 2000 (revenues in 1999 were $176 billion compared to $194 billion in 2000). 1980, 1990, 2007/08 were all peaks on the graph before revenues momentarily fell as the result of a recession.

&gt;corporate revenues increased by almost 20x between 2008 and 2020 but your number show barely a 25% increase

corporate profits [doubled between 2008 and 2019](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/corporate-profits), i' m not sure where you're getting your 20x metric.

&gt;it doesn't prove the tax rate isn't effective

if the tax was effective at collecting revenue, it would collect more revenue. making the argument that corporations are avoiding the tax is arguing against your points, because it illustrates the ineffectiveness of the tax. at this point, you're doing my job for me.",conservatives

at the very least, if you're going to heat with electricity you have to use a heat pump so at least you are getting 2-3 units of heat, for every unit of electricity used.  vs. an electric furnace, you get exactly 1 unit of heat, or every unit of electricity.  \"geothermal\" is also good, though you need land for that, something most people don't have the luxury of.  and the geothermal i'm talking about, is falsely called that (which should be stopped).  we're not iceland with free heat in the ground.  canadian geothermal is simply a heat pump that sucks heat out of the ground, rather than the air.  it's still highly electricity intensive.

unfortunately, canada is in a cold climate, and it is always going to take a lot of energy to keep our homes warm.  digging shit out of the ground and lighting it on fire, is still the only practical way to do that.

this is just brazen. he knows that we've been warned of this very sort of outcome for years. we've _had_ similar flooding in the past, in the same areas that were effected. hell, the vancouver island highway developed a sink hole in a spot where one developed _a few years prior_.

&gt; b.c.’s auditor-general, carol bellringer, cautioned in a february, 2018, report that the provincial government “may not be able to manage flood risks given a number of factors including a lack of staffing and technical capacity, outdated flood-plain maps, and roles and responsibilities that are spread out across many agencies and levels of government. similarly, government’s wildfire prevention activities are not sufficient, and to date, have not substantially reduced the risk.”

maybe horgan just doesn't speak to his own auditor-general?

&gt; mr. horgan was once one of the critics calling for action. “i remember talking, as an opposition member, to the local mayors in the [fraser river] region about the need to invest billions of dollars in diking and other remediation efforts in the event of such an event as we’ve just had,” he said in an interview, just hours after signing off on the latest state-of-emergency order.

or maybe he's just lying when he said no one could've predicted it or prepared for it.

this is scandalous. flat out scandal; _*people are dead*_ and thousands of livestock along with them. and there's a good chance that the damage could have been mitigated, if not avoided. 

the ndp, in their usual fashion, are denying any responsibility. i expect if that tactic fails, they'll pivot to blaming the bc liberals. it'll work, too, because ndp supporters are like tory voters: enough of them simply will not waver in their support of the party.

don’t listen to any of the naysayers who say it’s provincial jurisdiction, the power of the purse is 100% how this would, could, and should work - and it wouldn’t even be hard. it just takes will, and money the feds really need to be spending in the first place to support the country’s population growth. really, i wonder if it would be helpful to see cities receiving a small but direct subsidy from the federal government in exchange for population growth (with stipulation that it’s spent on either transportation or housing, though that may be hard in practice).",conservatives

&gt;there was a time when federal party leaders took unequivocal stands against the more regressive aspects of quebec’s fight to protect the french language and culture.

what are/were these so-called regressive moves to protect french language and culture? seriously, what are they? history is filled with anglophone columnists frothing at the mouth anytime national minorities (francophones, indigenous peoples) do anything to ensure the survival of their languages and cultures. anything breaking away from the english canadian hegemony is unfairly smeared as regressive. 

&gt;state-mandated discrimination that forces people to choose between their beliefs and their employment is now a fact of life for some religious minorities in quebec.

ridiculous that this is painted as discrimination. this law applies to every religion equally, to every religious symbol equally. also ridiculous that following secular norms in your work shift when representing the state is portrayed as choosing between beliefs and employment. beliefs exist regardless of what one wears at work. 

the idea that people automatically repudiate their faith if they don't wear religious symbols 24/7 (which no one does, no one showers or sleeps or is born with religious symbols, btw) when the majority of people within each religion don't wear religious symbols is just so... out there. 

but back to business. the globe and mail editorial would like us to believe that \"having principles\" is politicians virtue signalling their displeasure at québec. which is nonsense. first, there's nothing the feds can do legally for bill 21 ; disallow clause one-year expiry date has passed, québec court has validated law &amp; supreme court is likely to because of notwithstanding clause. and bill 96 mostly just builds on the existing bill 101, with the exception that it may insert unilaterally (which all provinces can do) some statements in the constitution. 

so on the \"doing something\" that the globe is asking, it would be limited to voicing displeasure, which trudeau and others have already done on bill 21. short of lpc strategists sharing their ground organization with the plq in order to eventually electorally remove the caq from power, what do you expect him to do? continue to state things he has stated before ad infinitum and creating an annoyance backlash towards him &amp; the anti-21 position? 

&gt;now, with separatism at a low ebb

it will only remain at a low ebb as long as québec feels it can decide  its sociocultural affairs. if more people decide that they can't, separatism will rise once more. québec will continue to have those laws, whether or not they're inside or outside canada, btw. something these columnists should think about instead of adopting the moronic belief that their endless hysteria will change minds.",liberals

i do think the user was being unreasonable when they made the claim that \"all racism stems from conservatives\", because it is patently false. there is little debate (that i am aware of, anyway) that behaviours we label \"intolerant\" or \"prejudicial\" tend to stem from an unwillingness *or* inability to modify existing behaviours in response to change.

given that *small-c* conservatism champions the status quo and resists change on the grounds that it might, somehow, end up being for the worse, it's pretty easy to see how that might engender/propagate higher levels of racism and prejudice even if the general ethos isn't directly advocating racial conflict.",conservatives

how and with what to replace it?  that's where the diversity of opinions comes in -- trudeau had his with the white paper and it was soundly rejected.

for me, treaties are between nations not between people.  the treaties bind canada's relations with the first nations and the obligations are there.  and those treaties need to be settled on a nation to nation basis, and each one will likely be different.  in some cases it may be that a nation becomes an entity on par with a province and carves out their territories from existing provinces.  in others there may be land ownership and extended rights over larger expanses of land.  that's all legal stuff.  but the indian act and indian status gets in the way.

treaties shouldn't make a \"registered indian\" or a \"non-status indian\" or an immigrant or a fourth-generation european descendant more special or more equal than anyone else -- we are all people and we are all equal, and the charter of rights should apply to and protect all of us.

but it's not something that gets them to vote in a certain way. for them, immigration issues are far more important. my parents vote ndp, not due to their liberal stance on many social issues (they dislike weed is legal) or even much apprehension of their economic issues (they are fine with the current system). they vote ndp since the ndp made a concerted effort to reach out to tamil voters when they first came to canada. i still remember as a kid how jack layton showed up at tamil events to voice his support for tamils. i think that probably stops the conservatives from picking up south asian votes. they are seen as the party which opposed their immigration to canada. 

but i'd like to propose a different reason, south asians tend to live in the major metropolitan areas. they may just be influenced in their politics by where they live. as south asian immigrants grow wealthy and gain political power with time, their economic and other social interests may become more important. when the anti-immigrant perception of the tories dies down, i think we would see a rightward trend for the group. i would believe a good example of this situation would be the south asian support for the british conservatives.",conservatives

in toronto, the three ridings that stayed liberal (don valley east and west, and scarborough guildwood) have large south asian populations, particularly a large muslim community in the don valley ridings. edit: i also wanted to add that don valley west is represented by a gay man federally and a gay woman provincially, both of whom are pretty open about it, but that hasn't stopped them from absolutely crushing it in the heavily south asian and muslim community of thorncliffe park. it's also a low income area, true, but you'd think there would be backlash against oliphant and wynne considering the community's generally anti-lgbt views. but this hasn't happened, in fact oliphant is pretty close to the muslim community there.

federally, south asian canadians are huge on the liberals, particularly in ontario. i've had some involvement in local liberal campaigns and south asians play a disproportionate role in liberal politics. it's a little weird that such a socially conservative community are also huge fans of a prime minister whose attitudes about feminism and lgbt rights would be alien to most south asian immigrants.

in my experience both as a liberal canvasser and an indo-canadian, the conservative brand is pretty unpopular with south asians because they're seen as xenophobic. there's a sense that the liberals are bastards, but they're *our* bastards.",liberals

similar things cannot be said of liberal’s relationship with chinese canadian. jean chrétien appointed a hongkong-born minister of citizenship and immigration, and the minister could not even get his government to apologize to chinese canadians about the racist head tax policies( i am not even sure if people in this subreddit know about the history as canadian governments don’t really care enough about it to this day) 

. at that time, chinese communities were organized to lobby martin’s liberal and many put aside their internal differences, cuz the last 20 or so victims of head tax were on their death bed and wanted to see a symbolic apology. paul martin’s government reacted with indifference. harper immediately apologized after being elected in 2006. since then, chinese canadian communities’ previously strong affiliation with liberals has been broken. whenever liberals speak about racism many older members thought of chrétien/martin government’s unwillingness to apologize to score such an easy win, not grit’s current commitment to anti-racism.

h35c4he,2021-06-26T07:36:40.000-07:00,"richmond conservative mps kenny chiu and alice wong vote against banning conversion therapy &gt; anti-lgbt and socially conservative politics don't seem to resonate as much with south asians in canada

i think this is because the importance of social conservatism in voting is inherently tied to christianity. south asian immigrants may be as socially conservative as east asian immigrants, but it doesn't translate into voting for conservative parties because there isn't a shared link through religion. i think another part of this is that in a lot of south asian communities, opposition to lgbt issues is more cultural than it is religious, so it's relatively easy to change one's views when adapting to a new culture. sikhism doesn't really mention sexual orientation one way or another, and i think hinduism is generally quite mixed on this. i'd also suggest that the lack of sermons plays a role here too. as a result, lgbt issues are much less important to socially conservative south asian voters at the ballot than they are to east asian voters. 

&gt; what i don't really understand is why the perception of tories as anti-immigrant/racist sticks so effectively in south asian and black communities, but either doesn't exist in the chinese community, or doesn't affect their vote.

well, south asian and black voters have been more likely to be the target of racist dogwhistles from conservatives (i.e. the niqab ban, barbaric cultural practices hotline, scaremongering about crime). the upcoming election will be a good test of that, given the rise of anti-chinese sentiment in the conservative movement. and going back to the importance of certain issues, racism simply matters more than social conservatism to south asian voters. it's that much harder for conservatives to deflect away from racism and talk about opposing lgbt issues, and it's even more challenging when they have to cross religious lines to do it as well.",conservatives

from your perspective, do you think the tamil community moved away from the ndp post-layton? scarborough-rouge park is heavily tamil and also the lpc's safest riding in canada according to 338canada. anandasangaree gets huge margins there, it probably helps that he's also tamil and knows the community.

in any case, i don't think urbanization is the only factor, because south asian areas are more liberal/left leaning than other areas in the same metropolitan area. peel region and scarborough in the gta, surrey in metro van, and the northeast of calgary are all more liberal federally and ndp provincially than comparable areas.",liberals

a recent similar situation would be liberal mp jim carr who took over year long medical leave of absence to receive treatment from cancer. carr didn't resign his seat or leave the liberal party to do so. he is choosing to run for office again this election. another example would be ndp mp mumilaaq qaqqaq who took a 8 month medical leave of absence and remained in the party. she, however, chose not to run again and made that clear upon her return from leave. both stepped away from all their caucus duties and all their constituency duties during their leaves.

hbemjqa,2021-09-02T14:00:12.000-07:00,"discussion thread - tva face-à-face debate 2021 no no.

otoole did embarass himself.

context matters, and since this was quebec focused, he did a very bad job.

he tried unsuccessfully to dance away - in poor french - from the question about whether quebec would still get the 6 billion dollars trudeau has promised to give the province for childcare. though technically it's a direct transfer in recognition of their already having childcare in line with the funding they are offering other provinces to stand up childcare.

so for quebec, it's been negotiated as \"free\" money. technically they could have earmarked it for childcare, and then quebec could have redistributed 6b of their tax funding from childcare, but the expedient, efficient, and politically beneficial approach was no strings money to cut out the middle man accountants.

otoole said he'd give people and families all over canada including quebec, a tax refund so they could choose how and where to spend the childcare money. 

that means no 6b check, and he kept saying he recognizes the good work for quebec and their good program 

trudeau (and blanchette) clobbered him on it. 

and all he could say can be summed up as \"i trust and respect canadian families to make smart choices with their own money, and we want to give it back to them\". 

so when you're in quebec and you say i'm broken french, i trust all canadians to use the money i give them through a tax refund (which requires paying federal taxes on) to subsidize the already subsidized system such that the total benefit is less than what is already agreed to and on offer - and - that this replaces a 6b do what you want premier legault check... and without much discussion on how it could coordinate with the quebec plan to boot (maybe it won't even give a subsidy to lower or middle income folks who max out the qc one already since the qc one is more generous than the proposed cpc one. he avoided answering beyond the canned \"i trust families to do what's best\" line. 

that's not good.

at all.

that's a big miss. 

effectively he was telling quebec \"no you won't get the cheque trudeau promised you and you might get some tax refund subsidy to add to what you've got now but no details\"

that's a bad play.",liberals

there is basically no customer service at this point, if by customer service people mean the ability to talk to someone on the phone or in person, or get a direct answer about your particular issue. i imagine this is a resource issue and they can't afford to staff people in local offices or the phone/email lines. but, the tax payer is still paying for some services, because mp offices have become customer service outposts for ircc.

one thing mendicino could have done (to your point i think) is be more public and honest about the issues. in fact, i think ircc messaging is harmful. not only is their website awful in many cases (information is vague or hidden in a sea of similar pages), but they prefer to sound 'progressive' rather than give people accurate information. one major example is study permits. canada is creating an industry selling study permits abroad, about 400,000 a year. canada tells people that these are an immigration pathway, when the reality is they aren't really. only about 25% of people move from a study permit to pr, and most of these are graduate students. people coming to canada on undergraduate permits come thinking they will be able to become citizens. this is what they are told by ircc, immigration agents oversees, and canadian universities. but ircc actually punishes any undergraduate applicant who they think might stay in the country: if you have family in canada, denied; if you don't have a lot of family in your home country (and thus look 'unstable'), denied; if they don't think your study permit looks logical for your profile, denied. i guess it is fine to deny people on these terms, but the public message to people is \"welcome to canada everybody!!!\"",liberals

that all changed during the pandemic. he displayed gross incompetence, over reactivity, poor planning, and implemented harsh lockdowns that just served to alienate his base of business owners and freedom-loving conservatives. now, as of 2021, i cannot, in good conscience, vote for him and will not vote for him in the next election. he has actually made me contemplate moving: if this is the best ontario can do, then this province is not for me.

all he had to do was implement 10 80% paid sick days and cover the cost for the employers, while allowing employees with a negative test to resume work. he should've also built hospital capacity during last summer when we had low cases. he should've implemented better contact tracing as well, and allowed for rapid tests. he could've avoided lockdowns if he had just planned right. the reopening plan for ontario is also overly stringent and too cautious for the situation we are in now; he should've just followed alberta's or saskatchewan's plan but he instead decided to just copy and paste federal recommendations (which i remember saying were ridiculous even before he released his plan). i voted for a conservative, not a liberal.

now it's not all his fault: a lot of this mess is shared with the federal government for different reasons. but that does not absolve him of any responsibility. that said, him being the target for this anti-islamophobic backlash is unreasonable since (a) motion 103 was a federal motion that had nothing to do with him, and (b) conservative opposition to it in the house was due to it signalling out muslims rather than all religions or due to \"islamophobia\" being an ill-defined term that can include criticism of islam. so no, he's completely innocent with this.

honestly, the thing that pissed me off the most was the vigil. while the attack in london was a horrendous tragedy, thousands were allowed to gather while we are still locked down in ontario. the federal leaders and ford were part of that group. how is that fair? so many people lost their family members this year but could not hold a funeral. the vigil just confirmed to me that this is all bullshit. ford must be either overcompensating with lockdown policies for the media/public or covid-19 just doesn't exist when a visible minority dies. i don't think it's the latter.",conservatives
