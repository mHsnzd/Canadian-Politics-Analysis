they're foreign owners until they get their permanent residency; they can be residing within canada for several years until that happens.

why would anyone do that? the case is where a family holds multiple properties; each family member has their official residence in a separate property, and maintains the appearance of such by paying utilities and ordering food from time to time.

&gt; you have to be the purist of the pure to even run for the federal ndp.

bullshit. 

&gt;  look what happened to erin weir

i'll grant you that removing erin weir was a mistake. an overreaction to the me too movement. it reminded me of al franken.

&gt; or how about when it comes to bill c-10? the ndp have contemplated supporting it for the hate speech protections

cool?

crazy conspiracy theory.

&gt; i can go on

i'm skeptical of that claim. you've barely said anything except for erin weir and that was 3 years ago.

&gt; if the ndp are doing the right things then why i have they been unable to break through in the polls with the conservatives in such bad shape?

i disagree with your premise and your conclusion.

the ndp are polling around 18-22% which is historically high for them and singh is the most popular federal leader. the ndp have also failed to overcome the conservatives since 1961, so i'm not sure what relevancy that has on anything.

as for whether they'd do better if they weren't so woke, you have no evidence that they are woke. again, the only thing you've mentioned is erin weir which was 3 years and an election ago.

2) provide far more details in their plans then they otherwise do. they rarely provide details - which the liberals are way better at doing. this makes it easier to show whats possible.

3) don’t force federalism on quebec. tell them you’ll work with like-minded premiers to publicize long term care homes rather then force it (some provinces with fully public ltcs &gt; no provinces with fully public ltcs

4) reconnect with labour roots. it’s uncomfortable to talk about but there are major issues with labour’s trust in the ndp and much of labour now prefers liberals.

5) scrap the wealth tax they can dodge. it’s worthless. what we need is a land value tax that scales on each additional holding after your primary residence. the more homes you get the more $$$ you pay. 10% of the wealthiest canadians own multiple properties, usually moe then a mere handful, and this will either force them to sell and increase available supply of fund social programs

i mostly align with liberal policy and voted ndp this year, but in any election i've never ruled out any party and in the past i have voted conservative...so if any of the below is helpful insight, happy to share it (keeping in mind i'm just one common joe).

&gt;canada itself seems to be moving to the left.

for me, emergency response and, by extension, climate change warrant urgent and ongoing attention, and it's not something that can be outsourced well to the private sector. in terms of both covid and canada's wildfires, just as two examples, i have to say i have more confidence in a gov't that's willing to spend a bit more to get it right before things get worse. there's a consistent trend that conservative-led provinces have generally struggled more to get their covid-19 response right (e.g. jason kenny in alberta). i want a government that respects science above all else when public safety is front and centre.

&gt;the ppc is now also splitting votes from the right side.

i wanted to like o'toole but when i look at the overall conservative base and see how much support there is for the ppc as well as advocacy \"news\" sites like rebel news, that shit makes me weary of supporting the cons. the main thing i hate about the ppc is they basically look at the most decisive elements of trump's usa and think to themselves, \"yeah we need this in canada.\" i think most of canadians are better than this and i think the conservative party can stay strong on their conservative ideals (even moreso that o'toole did) without succumbing to the absolute rock bottom that is trump-style politics. completely unburdened by fact, everything is \"fake news\" and you win your votes by sinking to the lowest common denominator of shitposting on social media. o'toole wasn't perfect but i at least wanted to take him seriously. andrew scheer i took one look at, saw the resemblance to us republican politics and was like \"nope not today, fuck this lol.\"

&gt;most of the entertainment slash social media are left leaning and have massive social influence.

no real comment here - you're mostly right i think although all social media platforms tend to lend an amplified voice to the opinionated minorities while downplaying the silent majority of people.

&gt;the usa republican party is most likely what most people in canada thing of when you talk about conservative and are very different then what most canadians would like to vote for.

trump's tenure was a train wreck i never want to see replicated in canada, and this has nothing to do with conservative policy. there was a blatant disregard for civil discourse and a clear will to undermine trust in the very institutions that are supposed to uphold democracy, and voting for more of that sets a horrible precedent imo. buddy wouldn't even leave his position without trying to stage a coup and claim the election was rigged. we're better than that in canada, regardless of political ideology.

&gt;racial, gender, and sexual orientation are currently the focus for most voters and conservatives are often seen as being on the wrong side of history for these issues.

none of these are deciding factors to me tbh. climate change, willingness to listen to science, and willingness to care for valuable populations are top of mind for me. i would vote for a socially conservative party that could meaningfully demonstrate that the above issues were top of mind while also demonstrating a general competence as a governing party. bonus points for a fiscally / economically responsible party but that's the conservative bread and butter anyways which is why i didn't feel the need to bring it up sooner.

&gt;most of the people you put forth are old and or unattractive, which sadly dose play a large part in how people vote.

literally not a factor in how i've ever voted. ever. a party's official position on the best hot sauce would weigh more heavily for me than how attractive or old the leader was, if that's helpful context.",conservatives

i wouldn't put mulcair in this category. during the 2015 electoral campaign, he and the ndp were polling in first place. it was generally believed that he had done a great job to hold the harper government accountable as opposition leader and he made the party a serious contender for government, even if they botched the campaign. mulcair would have been a fine first ndp pm. 

&gt;i’m not a big o’toole guy. but what are better conservative options?

inside caucus? hard to come up with a better option, but that shouldn't be seen as a ringing endorsement for o'toole, who is being run over by his own caucus. outside caucus? anyone with a solid vision, better french, and who would stop pandering to the base.  like chris alexander or  jean charest. but whatever, the cpc seems determined to remain underwater in eastern canada, which stops them from forming government. they know what they have to do, they just don't want to do it. 

&gt;singh needs to stop falling for basic political pitfalls. like that’s it. that his flaw: poor optics and poor tactics.

no, i believe singh's incompetence runs deeper than that. he's shown time and time again to not know his files, confuses provincial and federal jurisdiction all the time, etc. if the ndp wants to compete for government, it needs to find another layton or mulcair, someone who knows where they're going.

on a personal note, i had a family member who tried to do this in our local municipality. she was unceremoniously fired, she sued and won, for demanding that the developer increase green spaces and parks within a yet to be built area. in fact, after she was fired the developer removed all parks and incorporated a walking trail instead.

based on what has been made public, other than the obvious murder charges, this london incident is a hate crime.

we' ll know soon if terrorism charges are laid.  i suspect they won't even be laid, but if they are i doubt it will stand up in court.  because it's likely not terrorism.  i could be wrong.  i think those calling this hâte crime terrorism are the wrong ones.  one will be proved right, i am betting on me.   if new info is presented to the public to suggest something different in the days to come i may change my mind.  as of now based on what the public knows, it is pure speculation to call this terrorism.


when a mass murderer targets young blond women and kills 5 he is not a terrorist despite him having a hate for a particular type of person based on appearance and gender. people may be terrorized by his actions but that still doesn't make mass murderers a terrorist, there is nothing poltical except his hate for a particular type of person.",liberals

there is some playing to fears for sure. but honestly, gun owners would know better than anyone how dangerous guns are, regulations as in the past are required, guns aren't just useful for hobbies. people are seriously afraid of guns, it may not not fully rationale, but a hobby shouldn't justify making people uncomfortable. canadian gun culture seems pretty cool with this, i never see guns anywhere outside of designated areas, everyone always talks about safety and responsibility.

so here the ndp plays between themselves and the liberals. they acknowledge risk, but point to the material underlying problem. it's politics so there is some balance and the ndp will want to appeal to lib voters too unfortunately.

&gt; “we know the root causes for violence in our communities – they include poverty, racial discrimination, huge gaps in mental health services, lack of adequate and affordable housing and the lack of meaningful, good quality job opportunities for young people,” singh wrote to trudeau. “prime minister, we must strike a new path, one that engages all communities in a united effort to tackle gun violence at its roots. we must replace simplistic solutions with comprehensive, well-informed strategies built out of partnership with those most affected.”

is this not a common sense approach? there is no fearmongering of assault weapons. it is not reactionary, they try to get to the source and not target hobbyists.

https://psmag.com/social-justice/why-some-members-of-the-far-left-advocate-against-gun-control us article so a bit more charged due to mass shootings, which are a problem there, and is the news liberals piggyback off of

there is never a hobby issue to anyone. i fear the hard conservative angle really overlooks the wide support gun owners could have across the entire political spectrum, i also feel it is intentional to keep the solutions very narrow, making it a wedge political issue as we talked about earlier.",liberals

that's not the least bit relevant. the prime minister may be functionally required to *ask* the governor general to dissolve parliament, but constitutional convention (and yes, it has been acknowledged that what constitutes \"constitutional\" is not just that which is written down in ca1867 and 1982) essentially requires her to grant the request. to refuse to grant such a request would be wildly inappropriate and for what purpose? the fixed election law, or any law for that matter, short of the ca1982 itself, does not have any bearing on constitutional convention, and the gg is not tasked with interpreting or even considering legislation.

\\&gt; why should something that was so nearly unanimously passed be given so much less weight than the equally non binding advice that a prime minister can tender?

because the people who passed it explicitly chose to communicate their desire \"to make every effort to ensure that voters are not called to the polls as long as this pandemic continues\" in a manner which holds exactly zero authoritative value. if it were even potentially intended to be binding, it would've been a legislative device with some teeth.

the prime minister´s advice and the motion are equal in legal effect. the one that was adopted by more people with less of a selfish motive and which was adopted by those who much more accurately reflect the proportions of the people than one man ever could, should be seen as more persuasive. courts look at persuasive evidence all the time, and decide which is more authoritative on factors precisely like this one, being adopted by a more democratically representative body than a less representative one.

as for the benefits of not holding an election, well: elections canada said that the 2019 election costed over 500 million dollars. why spend it on that much money just to satisfy one man, just to satisfy an old convention that derives from zero laws or constitutional clauses when so many mps of such variety of political opinions agree to dispense with an election in a year like this? it also makes it much harder for parties themselves to be internally democratic, like holding fair nomination contests with appropriate interest from their membership, so as to minimize the influence of party leadership in these grassroots activities. it opens up the possibility of corruption and pandering to powerful economic and social interests above ordinary people when more money has to be spent on campaign and donations must be solicited. it means that a huge amount of hours, given by thousands of dedicated people on bills and resolutions, committee reports, and attempts to get information for the people to see, has to start over again, making it far less efficient to legislate, especially when you know one man can pull the plug so easily when it is inconvenient to him.",liberals

1. no, i don't support quebec separation. but you can have a federation where certain subnational jurisdictions have different powers. we already give quebec control over immigration despite it clearly being federal jurisdiction, for example. we can try to get quebec kicking and screaming into line, the problem is, most quebecers see themselves as a nation (even if they don't support sovereignty) and will see it as an encroachment by the federal government. quebec clearly has a fundamentally different understanding of canada. if we can't change their minds, and they can't change ours, then the most obvious solution is to give quebec full control over their culture. my problem right now is, every time quebec infringes on the charter, it weakens it elsewhere. the nwc/s. 33 was meant to be an emergency last-ditch option, yet we've seen it increasingly become a part of political discussion in english canada, like just yesterday when our glorious emperor douglas ii of house ford decided to invoke it to limit third-party advertising.
2. the notwithstanding clause *is* a legitimate part of the charter - and that's my problem. the very point of a constitution is to make sure that certain things are beyond the reach of any government. but the nwc makes sections 2-7 and 15 (i think it's those ones) possible to bypass. i fully support s. 1 because sometimes there are reasonable limits to rights and freedoms. but s. 33 isn't about reasonable limits, it's about legislatures overriding the judiciary on matters of fundamental principles, and that's something i fundamentally do not support. yes, the courts can enforce the charter. then provinces can override it. so did the courts really enforce the charter?
3. letting quebec control its cultural affairs takes it out of federal politics, where frankly it doesn't belong. again, while the rest of canada values the charter very dearly, quebec hasn't even signed the 1982 constitution. quebec governments of every stripe have gone against the charter. clearly there is one part of canada that doesn't support it, and their actions weaken the charter's authority.

really my big problem is with the charter itself, specifically section 33, the justifications for which i think are extremely flimsy. further decentralizing quebec isn't really my desired outcome, but i think it's the most practical solution. quebec would never accept giving up levers over their cultural affairs, our politicians aren't even trying to convince them, and having lived in quebec (okay, rented a place in gatineau while working in ottawa so i'm no great authority), quebecers aren't going to be convinced by federal politicians to give up their levers.",liberals

to summarize, it’s xenophobia. they fear those that don’t look and speak like them, and so they advocate for policies that reflect that. aka bill c-21

that's absurd and vile. there are no adjectives to properly descibe the contempt i feel for the anglo media after seing québec being always the designated scapegoat for all of canada's problems.

residential schools? even if done at the direction of the government of canada and by protestants and anglophones as well... it's all the fault of french-canadian catholics if you ask english canada. english-canadian and protestant hands are somehow clean of the sin of genocide: it's all on us.

and now this?!!

sure, make us the scapegoat again so you can look at yourselves in the mirror and see a flawless and perfect canada (if only we québécois weren't there like a cancer on your perfect society).

you know, i love canada and québec. and there are a billion flaws in québécois society. but today i wish we were gone from the confederation for a while, so for once your society and media couldn't scapegoat us for all of canada's problems and would instead have to use introspection and might possibly try to fix them.

dont you think it's weird for literally all ontario newspapers to focus on retribution against québec after an attack by a violent white supremacist ontarian terrorist in ontario?

maybe some focus should be put on hate networks in ontario.

the supreme court ruled in the 80s that there is no such thing as an overuse of the nothwithstanding clause as it is not up to them to rule on whether a use is reasonable or not. and they ruled that after quebec being pissed at the charter being forced down its throat had been invoking the clause on every single law it had passed in five years no matter how irrelevant it was.

we can’t simply remove it as it serves the vital role of letting us pretend that our laws and values are compatible.

i think that your idea has potential but it’s a bit vague. i’d go with “the supreme court of canada has no autority on quebec except on criminal or cross-provincial issues”. you could have your laws as you like them, we could have ours, and we’d stop stepping on each other’s toes.

i think you're criticizing the lpc on the back of a promise they never made.

i remember the 2015 election quite well, and the platform item was quite specific: they wanted to increase the top marginal rate.  they did that.  

the small business tax reduction was also part of the 2015 platform, which is i think the thing you are characterizing as \"cutting taxes for the professional class.\"  they also implemented this.

in the meantime, the \"broad based tax cut\" from the 2019 platform came in the form of an increased standard credit, which also has a specific phase-out at high incomes.  the phase-out entirely eliminates the benefit of the increased standard credit for those in the top tax bracket.

on these topics, i think the lpc has delivered almost exactly what they promised.  note that \"cutting taxes for small businesses\" is a popular proposal, even if the net effect is \"cutting taxes for the professional class.\"  turns out people's opinions of a policy can depend very heavily on the framing.

in the meantime, i think you're conflating different notions of \"rich.\"  if an ndp-style wealth tax is an answer to \"taxing the rich,\" then the vast majority of those rich will also have been affected by the top tax bracket increase.  if instead you are concerned with taxes paid by upper-but-not-top income individuals (say $100k/yr and up in income), these people are unlikely to be affected by a wealth tax with the current ndp thresholds, so the ndp isn't taxing the slightly-less-rich either.

&gt; but spent all the revenue (and more)

[as a share of gdp](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/services/publications/fiscal-reference-tables/2020/part-1.html#tbl4), both personal and corporate income taxes increased from fy2014-15 (pre-lpc) to fy2015-16, and they remained roughly steady through fy2019-20.  the lpc presides over a government that taxes more heavily than the harper majority government did.  

fy2019-20 net revenues level is about 0.5%gdp higher than fy2014-15.

&gt; ruled out taxing capital gains as income

that's shorthand which can be misleading.  right now capital gains is taxed as income, but 50% of the capital gain is excluded from income on the theory that it was already subject to taxes at the corporate level.  the ndp has proposed increasing the capital gains inclusion rate; i'm not sure where their most recent proposals would put it.

capital gains absolutely do receive a preferential tax treatment, but shorthand as you use can give the impression that it's entirely untaxed.

&gt; canadians know that new public programs aren't free and the liberals haven't raised revenues to pay for the kind of vision they profess.

do they, really?  if this were the case, i'd expect to see the lpc fortunes take a larger hit on the fears of a large deficit, and this has not yet been borne out in surveys.

this article notes that wealth taxes are a relatively popular suggestion, but i wonder if the question is being interpreted as \"if we have to raise taxes, what kind of tax increase would you prefer?\"  of course i'd prefer a tax increase that doesn't affect me, but that doesn't mean i'd prefer a tax increase to nothing.

i expect the lpc will run on something like \"we are on course to return to fiscal stability, and in the meantime we can use this recovery to make necessary investments in the economy like our child care plan _without_ new taxes.\" 

to me, this is a hard proposal to argue against unless you already mistrust the lpc, and in particular i think the ndp is taking a big risk with the idea of taxing the rich to be _inherently popular_, rather than just _the least bad of options._",liberals

explain why. from what i've seen so far since the cuban revolution, the us government has repeatedly tried to kill cuban politicians, including the president, has placed an embargo on the country that costs the country billions of dollars, and has repeatedly tried to subvert their government for political purposes, all while engaging in similar and oftentimes more violent activities elsewhere in the region.

during the same period, the cuban government virtually eliminated child malnourishment, drastically decreased infant and post-parnum mortality, and has provided better quality healthcare for its citizens than are received by the average american.

&gt;the current us president supported those protests and was elected in part due to promising to enact police reform.

&gt; in order to have a strong economy and maintain good health, canada must have strong, coordinated and achievable environmental policies.

&gt; the conservative party believes that responsible exploration, development, conservation and renewal of our environment are vital to our continued well-being as a nation and as individuals.

&gt; we believe that it is the responsibility of government to ensure that the sometimes competing values of preserving the environment and creating jobs are maintained in proper balance.

&gt; we believe that all environment and energy initiatives should be reviewed.

&gt; we believe that an effective international emissions reduction regime on climate change must be truly global and must include binding targets for all the world’s major emitters, including china and the united states.

&gt; we believe that canada should create a program to heighten public awareness to the economic benefits of environmental solutions which minimize the waste of resources.

&gt; **we recognize that climate change is real. the conservative party is willing to act**

&gt; **we believe that canadian businesses classified as highly polluting need to take more responsibility in implementing measures that will reduce their ghg emissions and need to be accountable for the results.**

&gt; **we believe in supporting innovation in green technologies. we need to become a world class leader and to use innovation as a lever of economic development.**

&gt; we believe that canada should establish a program of tax credits to promote environmental solutions in the areas of transportation and entrepreneurial innovation, among others.

&gt; we believe that the federal and territorial governments should make joint investments to study and address climate change adaptation in the north.

i took a bunch of sociology and this is one of those bleedouts that's complex and needs lots of explanation, but in summary: the way we talk about race in north america is in relation to white people. whiteness, isn't really a race, because it only exists in relation to those around it. hence, we racialized others. we impose characteristics, stereotypes, etc. on others that have structural and societal impact.

sidebar: white quebecois often think western anglos are racist towards them. we're not, because it's related to their accent and language. but it's still another form of othering and stereotyping and acting towards them in such a structural manner that they feel it is racist.

that's not even to get into the definition of african americans and how most people don't know their familial roots. so 'black' can work.

others did good things from time to time - i'll always be thankful for chretien caping donations to political partes, even if he did do it to piss off paul martin. but no one prime  minister did as many positive things as harper did in his time. and most of it with a minority gov't.",liberals

the way he explained it, every time you buy something like gasoline, some of what you spend is tucked away in this personal carbon savings account, and you can use that money to buy approved green things like teslas, bicycles, or transit passes. the host asked \"how is that an incentive to use less carbon?  it sounds like you keep control of your money, and can use it to buy things you would have bought anyway.\"  and his answer was that it would allow you to track your carbon footprint via the balance in this account.

nobody is saying that we (except for those who were actually involved) are at fault.  we're just saying that we can't ignore the past, and that we should do our best to help those who have been hurt heal.

&gt;this was racism from those in charge not the people that they represented

citation needed.  given the rampant racism of even just a few decades ago, it would not surprise me in the least if it turns out that the majority of canadians back then were perfectly happy with committing ethnocide.

also, we need to get over this whole \"the government did it, it's not the fault of the people who elected them\" idea.  democracy is built on the idea of the people having political power, and with power comes responsibility.  we, the voters, are responsible for what the government does because we gave them the power to do it.  the canadians of the past (who aren't my ancestors, since i wasn't even born here), are just as responsible for their government's actions as i am for this government's.",liberals

incorrect. under a majoritarian system majorities are inherently unstable. it only requires a small shift in public opinion to move a party from majority to not even holding official party status. eg: the ontario liberals. 

this incentivises parties to appeal to and thus represent as many people as possible because they never know where their votes will come from.
