no, the article said about italy:

&gt; italy is another country with a proportional representation electoral system – and enormous instability. its parliament has been forced to dissolve eight times in the past 40 years due to coalitions disintegrating.

that's 8 times when the coalition government fell apart. and **it doesn't necessarily lead to an election, it leads to a change in government**, with some other party forming a coalition to take over. it is instability, and it doesn't help if government plans go one way, but then unexpectedly have to change soon after.

and other elections are in addition to that.


australia uses pr for their senate, which is what the article talks about.

and look at belgium for an even worse case:

some of liberal incumbents have a real fight. west van sea to sky, north van seymour, fleetwood and coquitlam are close. i don’t think delta (esdc minister’s seats) is 100% sure thing either. 

as pick ups. i feel really really feel good about surrey white rock and cloverdale langley city. i think the riding campaigns in richmond steveston, mission matsqui fraser are going well. 

van granville is a complete toss up (it shouldn’t have been but the candidate is terrible). port moody coquitlam is a reach but wouldn’t count on it.

i just think in the fraser valley and vancouver the liberals have a good ground game. that is what i think the lead to them picking up seats while safeguarding thier incumbents. i don’t think any ndp seats will flip, but a bunch of conservative seats are within reach. 

outside the lower mainland things are probably ma different. but even in the 2015 wave, they picked up one seat outside the lower mainland. so i think what is happening in the interior or vancouver island will not impact the party’s seat count much.

i am not sure i *share* it - truly obnoxious members of government can be poison for basic sane policy, in my opinion, unless they are, at best ignored.  the moment they are required for coalition power, they can turn small issues into wedge politics.

but the pointless wedge policy issue that i roll my eyes at might be someone else's pet issue they are finally happy to see someone advocating for, so like i said, i can respect it.

the flaw you detected, though, has a false assumption, i think. 
 adding another person might make more people happy, but it won't *just* do that.  there is no world where adding, say, kevin o'leary to parliament causes me to have a *neutral* reaction.  every addition of a member changes parliament, either for better or for worse.

like i said, i still think mmp makes sense for canada's parliament, if only because the parties really are almost single blocks of power, not a bunch of regional mps.  mmp just accepts that reality.  but if i was very focused on my mp, i'd rather have the one we all collectively said \"eh, fine\" to.

it is simplistic and taken out of context to support your claim. at the time, belgium was going through a separatist crisis akin to what we went through with the october crisis. except they disnt have to impose martial law. instead they negotiated and worked througg their differences.

politics isnt always easy and solved in a day. it takes compromise and learning to work with others. not to mention that a study found that not having a government formed did not adversely affect the belgian economy.

most ridings do not offer viable independent candidates. personally, i am a supporter of the communist party of canada, which runs candidates in bc and you should absolutely support them if you want your vote to go to a party that stands for labour. in any case, it's one thing to vote given a limited set of options, entirely different to spend time canvassing or organizing for the party out of some expectation it will yield the returns you want. my criticism really relates to people who actively support the party.

&gt;i don't think the article does a good job of explaining but for a work place to unionize you need to first vote via card certification and then wait 5 days (changed by bcndp) then have a secret ballot vote again. greens sayimg that getting rid of secret ballot is undemocratic is rhetoric. this just gives time for employers to scare people to voting no. just a thought of waiting 10 days previously scared my co workers to not go through with the card certification.

this is a great example because the ndp ostensibly sacrificed a campaign commitment - a commitment which had been made in exchange for active union support in the election - so that it could get into government and finally do the work of the party of labour. fast forward to today and what has the bc ndp done in retrospect? 

it has [given record money](https://twitter.com/dogwoodbc/status/1404847956100980738) to the oil industry and [failed to protect workers](https://stuartparker.ca/why-are-we-surprised-the-bc-ndp-is-forcing-thousands-of-workers-back-to-work-in-man-camps-for-big-oil/);

it has allowed landlords to run rampant in the province, [evicting tenants](http://peoplesvoice.ca/2020/06/28/bc-ndp-resumes-evictions-amid-pandemic/) and driving speculative housing prices.

&gt;you got any links for this?

the bc ndp government has never actively threatened back-to-work legislation. however, it has not taken a clear policy position while in government, including during periods of contentious negotiations.

b2w legislation must be understood in the historic context that 1) governments have demonstrated they can get away with it, constitution be damned, and 2) public sector negotiations take place with the ever-present tension that the employer is arguing for 'fiscal constraint' while at the same time maintaining corporate tax cuts &amp; giveaway. look at the language of a bc ndp government during negotiations and you will see no difference from a liberal or conservative government seeking to balance the books on the backs of workers.

a few years ago during contentious ucp (alberta) negotiations, opposition ndp rachel notley boasted of how her government had been able to keep wages frozen or at 1% while in office. this was due to the pressure exerted on unions not to cause too much fuss, less they force the government to take a more hostile stance and cause another rae days incident.

just to look at some of the most prominent anglophone governments of the period:

nothing the rae government did compares with martin and chretien carving up the canada social transfer and creating a generation of homeless people who would go on to be targeted and abused by the subsequent harris government. it similarly pales in comparison with the union-busting and foreign imperialism of thatcher and reagan. to suggest otherwise is hard to take seriously.

\"release a platform\"... and the lpc is probably sitting there saying \"more of what we're already doing\".

now, that could go both ways depending on the listener, but as the party in power who recently did a throne speech, one can assume that that's their platform itself.

where the opposition don't have the opportunity to have already established a throne speech and platform while governing. they need a platform to showcase what they would do if they won.

we already know what the lpc will do if they win. more of the same. more of the last 6.5 years. you don't need a platform document to outline that. in eddition, most announcements are being made one by one. its a good strategy because it means that new \"promises\" are always in the news, isntead of just being talked about up front. plus gives cpc/ndp less chance to attack the position during the campaign.",liberals

the key stumbling block is our inability to engage in discussions of  constitutional reform on single issues. any discussion about constitutional reform will inevitably expand onto other issues, as the various provinces will see it as an opportunity to extract concessions and have more authority devolved to their level in order to secure their support.

for example, expanding infrastructure north and into the north west passage trade route is an extremely risky endeavour for a private company, due to the incredibly high costs required and the relatively long period (likely decades) of time before that infrastructure facilitates enough profit to cover the initial expense. an effective governemnts *should* be able to coordinate private industry with public interest as to make the investments in northern infrastructure worth while. this type of action by a government would directly produce economic activity, opportunity and growth, instead of just passively providing services.",conservatives

not to mention that proportional voting systems encourage more cooperation between parties in order to have options and not need a single party. under a proportional system, the cpc would have to play nicer. they cant just attack trudeau and gain dozens of seats off a few percentage points. they can't form a majority even with themselves and the ppc. they would need a 3rd party at least, and the other parties are also making deals. it is the kind of thing that forces the smaller party to give more concessions. sure they could cut a deal with the ppc and barely hold power. or they could just cut a deal with the liberals and hold some power while compromising on some stuff rather than give into unpopular policy.",liberals

now she did a fairly good job, she got second place as a green and went from 7%-32% of the vote, but she lost when she had a fairly good opportunity to win. it will also depend on how she does as a national campaigner, singh and trudeau are both strong campaigners and so they will raise the numbers for their parties in that riding because that's who most voters will be paying attention to.

to be fair, the canadian public wasn't really clamoring for it anyway. from my experience at least it only seems to come up whenever someone is up for election as \"hey trudeau didn't do that thing he said he would\".  no one's camping outside asking for electoral reform, the only people protesting seem to be environmentalists, antivaxxers, ppc rage-fueled voters. even back when the liberals closed the discussion, the country seems to have collectively shrugged. so at some point everyone involved should ask, how committed are we to this change we want and what should success look like but nobody had a fucking clue.",liberals

hdd80mm,2021-09-18T05:19:54.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected hey, /u/eatbacondaily, i appreciate your candour here, but you're wrong on this one. but hey, let's discuss because it's a neat idea.

the liberals stand to be the **huge** losers in a pr electoral reform. they have won majority governments with minority votes for a century. this is because fptp disproportionately helps front-runners (since you don't need to get *all* the votes, just *more than anyone else*). on top of that, part of the reason that they do well presently is because their votes are packed nicely into urban areas.

the cpc gets a similar front-runner advantage, but they have a slightly more evenly spread out vote, which means that the liberals tend to get more seats with the same votes nationally. they're also at a bigger disadvantage because they don't have a right flank of the party to draw votes from.

if you look at canada's electoral history, you'll see that those two parties have won every election. recently, with a 5 party system, they're able to win majorities with fewer than 2 in 5 votes. and the cpc and lpc are always the parties against electoral reform, so that suggests that they think that they have something to lose.

the bq would likely be (sort of) an even bigger loser, since they have highly concentrated votes in very few ridings. that means that they always score more seats than their vote counts warrant. if for no other reason, fptp is a bad idea because it encourages regionalist or separatist parties (and we have provincial governments for that already!)

so, who wins from pr? the ndp, the greens, and the ppc. any party that struggles that has wide and thin support, really. (as you noted correctly!) i'm sure the 20 to 30% of ndp voters out there (in a given election) would argue that they deserve a larger voice in parliament, even if it doesn't mean that they gain power.

lastly, how are you eating your bacon today?",liberals

&gt;these parties simultaneously look down upon and berate those without post-secondary education and mock them openly

i honestly don't see this. i often read and hear about trade workers who hate office workers for 'looking down on them' meanwhile in the office we talk about how we probably should've gone to trade school. yet the opc says that workers abuse their measly 3 sick days a year. 

and yet i had to hear ford go on and on about the so-called downtown elites. it seems this it's just a divisive tactic is used as a boogeyman to get people riled up against the other team.

&gt;realistically, the opc needs to focus more on income inequality, potentially ala harper style who had a decent impact on income inequality a

first ill give credit to harper for trying to increase telecom competition although i think the sasktel approach is far better. plus his employment tax credit was a great move.

 i honestly just don't think they want to solve income inequality. ford eliminated sick days before covid and still refused to back down. i try to stay away from assumptions but i think its an open yet secret tenet of conservatism that \\~20% of population has to go without in order to sustain the economy. because then wages would rise etc.

&gt;ondp/olp need to market themselves better on social issues and just simply not openly attack the working class by calling them dumb for not voting or voting opc.

i disagree that this is a problem. i dont see many people implying the working class is dumb. the left actually tries to humanize the homeless population and people in poverty. these seems like a perception that conservatives want their lower class voters to see.

however i think the lpc and ndp need to drop the obsession with identity politics. they should both just re-iterate the need for economic equality and how that removes white privilege by giving everyone a real opportunity. and trans issues do not need to be discussed obsessively. acceptance comes over time, its weird to try and capitalize on the trend by proposing legislation to somehow stop people from being mean.",conservatives

i did, you were trying to apply the tax specifically to the development of new homes. disagree with you there. 

&gt;	75% is not that unreasonable, especially if progressive policy is put in place for things like developments of new non-luxury homes specifically etc.

75% is pretty high in my opinion, but i don't see why we can't still develop new non-luxury homes?

&gt;	did you even read this yourself? from this exact source:

i noted to go down to the \"how far can you stretch a tax?\" part where it talks about the capital gains tax. 

&gt;	this is an investment guide, not a macro-economics source.

it describes how and why capital gains tax influences investments.

&gt;	so basically restating what i just said in my last post about how the position you present in your posts is not a consensus among economists- it's really disingenuous to present it as such. you also did not respond to the stiglitz paper i linked, i wonder why.

no, the conclusions between economists and researchers are noticing the impact a capital gains tax has on investments.

and that paper - by a pretty liberal think tank if i may bring to attention - was trying to promote equity through taxation which i don't agree with. equality of opportunity is what i believe in, which the study only covers through an american lens which is way different than here in canada. we do have significantly better equality of opportunity and social mobility. are there places to improve, sure. but we are doing pretty well, and there is no need to try and introduce fiscal legislation that would do more harm than good. 

&gt;	are you reading critically?

everything i said there at the end is factually correct. even in high income tax countries in scandinavia, they have very competitive capital gains tax rates and corporate tax rates because they understand the importance of it to maintain a strong economy.",liberals
