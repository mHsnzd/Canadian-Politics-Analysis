percentage of the population just doesn't pay income taxes...like at all  
 and the institutions in place aren't great to enforce it, and that's   
hasn't changed much since.

this was the 5th time they went bankrupt. i think it's safe to say the population was aware of the consequences before hand. 

&gt;greece is in the eu, they have zero flexibility when it comes monetary policy to help them get out of their rut.

that actually worked to their advantage. they'd have tanked much sooner if they had their own currency. and there'd have been no bail out. the fact that the euro was backed by germany etc was what kept them from being devalued earlier. 

&gt;when they voted their right-wing government in, the first thing they did was sell infrastructure, mostly to the chinese.

whereas for us it's our left wing gov't selling us out to the chinese.  well - you're not wrong but i'm not sure there's a noticeable practical difference :)

the fact is you can never compare two different countries in direct and absolute terms. there are always differences for sure. so i'll concede that easily enough. 

but the fact is there are similarities. greece allowed spending beyond it's means and the voters voted for it again and again knowing full well that they were doing so. but they wanted to vote themselves 'free' money. they knew the gov't was going into debt, they knew what the tax revenues were, and any reasonable person should have known that this was going to end in financial ruin - yet they kept voting in gov'ts who were willing to do that instead of voting them the hell out and putting in someone reasonable before it came to disaster. 

and that's what we're seeing here. in 7 years we will have added more than double the entire amount of money borrowed in the last 150 years.  think about that - we've had bad debt servicing crisis before with a fraction of the debt we now have. right after the last trudeau in fact.   

so the day will come when there's a collapse and we have to cut spending radically and maintain high taxes and give up much of our social safety net to cope. interest rates will rocket, people will lose their homes, etc etc.  

starting to see the similarities? and we won't have germany to bail us out.",liberals

it didn't work last time, as we couldn't trap the liberals in controversy. blackface, ethics scandals, nothing stuck. i don't know if we could consistently win toronto without basically merging with the liberal party in terms of policy and abandoning the prairies to the ppc/maverick/someone of the canadian right wing.

winning cities depends on what the urbanites key issue is, which is probably covid at the moment. there's a chance we could sway some by calling out the recklessness of an election, but that only works until someone points out that other elections have safely occurred during it. maybe the consolidation of power point would work? and even then, many would never consider voting conservative out of some sense of principle.",liberals

i can see a few likely objections, so let me take each in turn. 

&gt;but the liberals need somebody to keep them honest. 

well, the ndp exists. moreover, the liberals now have a strong interest in supporting broadly green policies because the regions that overwhelmingly vote liberal would benefit from them (even if they'll build the odd pipeline). if you look at co2 emissions by province, canada looks like europe apart from two provinces where the liberals have zero seats. 

&gt;the greens are ideologically diverse and many of them are former pcs

this is somewhat true of green party activists (especially of the ontario green party). i remember attending a really interesting constituency debate where the green candidate made the case for georgism. i think it is less true than it was 10 years ago, though the greens do seem to be a weird repository for ideas that lack a political home in canada. paul's pro-israel leanings, or elizabeth may's past comments on abortion fit that story. however, green voters are mostly lefties. you see this whenever surveys analyze [the second choice of voters](https://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2019/10/deadlocked-national-race-obscures-seat-advantage-for-liberals/). in 2019 68% of greens had the liberals or ndp as a second choice, while only 6% would vote conservative.",liberals

so the money raised by the levy would be put aside into individual savings accounts. so if you buy gasoline, the carbon tax portion of the money you spend gets put aside in a savings account for you. the government then publishes a list of approved \"green\" expenses, such as bikes or new furnaces, and those are the only things you can spend the money on.

in case you haven't spotted the weird problem with this:

if you reduce your carbon-intensive consumption, you end up with less money in your account. similarly, if you have planned expenses that the government declares to be \"green\", then you may not actually notice the carbon levy at all, except for a weird complication to your financial arrangements.",conservatives

although i can't read the article due to the paywall it's fair to say that many party members on the front lines had no idea that such a plan was being made/going to be a part of the platform. as for the plan itself. my view on it is that the carbon tax side of it is too easily avoided: people can pay for their gas in cash as an example. plus it is in a way incentivizing people to buying more gas when if you want it to be a serious carbon tax then the goal should be to discourage gasoline sales. furthermore, with these carbon savings accounts the problem is that they want to limit how people can spend the money yet how will that be enforced? probably by creating a whole new bunch of government employees assigned to audit these accounts. what about those people that drive and live in rental situations: how could they spend the money?

1) while uighur treatment has been a horrible human rights violation, it isn't genocide by any understanding of the word.

2) by applying literally the worst label we have to a country we are simultaneously eroding the moral call to action which such a label is supposed to encourage.

3) using an inaccurate term makes actual chinese citizens less likely to believe us on this or other issues. the actual crimes are bad enough, explain those and win support rather than accuse china of something far worse. (sort of like how conservatives decry everything as socialism, i'm much less likely to listen to them about socialism or their other ideas.)

there's a reason pompeo started this kerfuffle on his last day in office when he knew a new administration was coming in; it divides the passionate but occasionally short sighted left against administrations. 

china is the essential partner when it comes to dealing with climate change, an existential threat. accusing it of things which it isn't quite doing ain't going to help.

this whole situation means that more private women's health clinics have started opening in province. however, if you don't have insurance, disponible income or are a minor, there are significant barriers to accessing private health care.

as far as i know, in many other provinces (like alberta for example), you can just phone up an obgyn and get a pap smear. no paying out of pocket, no referral, just a call, or even a walk-in some times.

the gg does retain some discretion to refuse a request for dissolution, but only under certain conditions:

1. the last election must still be so recent that a dissolution request amounts to a subversion of the democratic will of the populace (one norm for this is the \"six month rule,\" though i've also seen interpretations like \"before the house passes its first supply bill,\" or \"before the house's confidence has been tested\"); and
2. there must be a viable alternative to the incumbent government, so that if the gov't resigns after the pm's request is refused, the new gov't can command the confidence of the house without needing an election.

currently, neither of those conditions is met. we're two years out from the last election already, and there is no evidence that any of the current opposition parties would be able to govern with majority support in the commons. so it's really clear-cut: if the pm asks the governor general for dissolution, then her excellency is constitutionally obliged to acquiesce, at which point an election is automatically triggered.",liberals

h6u0dju,2021-07-28T00:22:53.000-07:00,"say no if justin trudeau asks for an election, jagmeet singh tells new governor general interestingly, i think that singh is technically right in terms of what traditional westminster relations between parliament and sovereign are supposed to be, as were the 2008 coalition and byng. 

the prime minister is an executive office. in a westminster democracy, the most important principle has always been the independence and integrity of parliament. after all, parliament is what we elect and is the voice of our democracy. wars were fought over who gets to call and to dissolve parliament - parliament or the monarch. 

traditionally, the person who speaks for parliament to the monarch and who advises whether parliament is functional, or not, and whether parliament has confidence in the government, or not, has been, surprise, surprise, the speaker. that's why he has that title. he speaks for parliament. (it's also the root of the tradition of the speaker being dragged to the chair, as telling the king what he didn't want to hear was perilous work, and an air of aggrieved reluctance to be such a messenger was deemed an appropriate protection). 

that means that, traditionally, it was for the speaker to tell the monarch who commands parliament's confidence or whether parliament was deadlocked and should be dissolved and an election called. 

the idea that the monarch or governor in council should internally decide the fate of parliament is a very reactive and troubling one from the perspective of the history of westminster parliaments.",liberals

lesson apprise: ne jamais sous-estimer les libéraux et surtout, ne jamais jamais surestimer le npd. je me suis un peu fourrée là-dessus avec vancouver et toronto.

au québec, j'avais le bloc gagnant dans châteauguay-lacolle et brome-missisquoi, mais perdant dans beauport-limoilou et trois-rivières.  j'avais aussi le pcc perdant dans certaines circonscriptions en saskatchewan, ce qui ne s'est pas matérialisé. 

&gt;mes sympathies pour votre bleu foncé.

miramichi ne cesse de décevoir. je m'y attendais, car miramichi -grand lake était une circonscription pivot en 2019, et la machine conservatrice était plus efficace sur le terrain. harris et stewart sont deux anciens ministres et députés provinciaux sortants très populaires. harris menait pour les libs pendant une bonne partie de la soirée, avant que stewart ne la rattrape. 

stewart a bénéficié des votes alliancistes - il a lui-même comparé la dualité linguistique avec la ségrégation aux états-unis et s'est prononcé contre le commissariat des langues officielles...c'est un opportuniste qui aime faire parler de lui. j'espère qu'il se fait sortir la prochaine fois. 

au moins, ça change pas grand chose. c'est 6 libéraux et 4 conservateurs. higgs avait cessé de se battre contre la taxe sur le carbone après les résultats de 2019, constatant que la majorité du nb avait voté pour des partis pro taxe sur le carbone. avec 42% de vote plc contre 34% pcc ( 38% plc et 33% pcc en 2019 ), le vote populaire reste assez stable pour les deux grands partis. ça forcera peut-être higgs à signer une entente avec trudeau pour les garderies (come on, même la saskatchewan l'a faite). 

en atlantique, la vraie surprise est coast of bays-central-notre dame. c'était dans la mire de personne. ce n'est pas encore finalisé, mais bon, je me demande pourquoi un député sortant populaire a du fil à retordre dans une circonscription ultra libérale.  les deux autres gains en atlantique, cumberland-colchester et south shore-st. margarets, étaient prévisibles. lenore zann et bernadette jordan ont récolté ce qu'elles ont semées avec leur mauvaise gestion de l'enquête publique sur la tuerie de 2020 et la crise des homards respectivement.",liberals

an example of this could be seen in gay marriage. while most conservatives were once opponents of gay marriage (there were a few outliers though), you'll now find that most new members of the conservative movement accept gay marriage. however, new members do tend to oppose more recent changes such as pronouns, all gender bath rooms etc. the abortion debate stays alive however as these movements are able to constantly change the framing of the issue (in the past religion was the primary justification, but now it's just framed as being amoral/genocidal to appeal to secular new members)

if you maintained the same beliefs you have now in 10 to 20 years you'd probably end up socially conservative as well. i remember how the people in my middle school used to talk back in 2013 and it's crazy to think how unacceptable that behavior would be now.

 advocating for a carbon tax may someday be conservative as strange as that might sound simply because society has \"progressed\" further than such ideas. the beliefs and views of the party will change as well of course to match societal trends and the beliefs of the new members. there is no static values of conservatism, just a reluctance or rejection of new ideas and an idealization of the past to some capacity.",conservatives

for it to be truly \"universal\" you would have to print money until our currency isnt worth the paper its printed on.

if we could sell our resources and fund it sort of like alaska does, then its not a bad idea. however many people wont get behind that due to the environmental impacts. when real estate is how your country is keeping the lights on per say, the only way to fund it is by either claw backs, or raising taxes. its no longer a ubi but a gbi. yes taxes would raise from claw back but thats effectively one cancelling the other out. but when people are asked to pick up the extra for everyone else, now its an issue of how tax payers dollars are being spent. im not suggesting that people will simply not work because of it. but i highly doubt that even after claw backs, and offsets for those who receive less than the full amount, there wont be some kind of deficit. 

i can personally get behind pharmacare and dental. do the costs of filling in everyones cavities outweigh when we have to put them in a hospital bed due to infection spreading throughout the body? most likely. even paying for someones antibiotics to deal with an abscess is roughly $30 vs the cost of hospitalization for blood poisoning-its a no brainer. those who do have some sort of drug benefit plan through unions would likely see their plans being closed and yes they would lose what they paid into it, but also not see that deduction from their pockets. those that require more intricate or specialized prescriptions (i.e. those that have to pay over $100/month) without those medications end up requiring hospitalization without such medication and lets say the cost of hospitalization is $1600 per day (based on avg. covid icu stay- $23000/14 days). so since they may not be in the icu lets say $1000 a day vs. $800 a month. its a savings. the only problem with socialized medicine is that if we didnt budget enough we limit ourselves to who and what we take care of. and something such as increasing prices of drugs or medical supplies can suddenly put us into a position where we have to make \"choices.\" we can only hope the savings of less hospitalization due to buying someones antibiotics keeps us afloat.

but when we have basically no way to fund these things other than printing money and the cost of everything sky rockets due to qe we end up back at square one. and then those who dont qualify now end up not having enough to pay their own dues, or end up themselves needing it. 

tl:dr we need a way to fund this before we can do it. or else its just a temporary band aid on an even bigger problem. one that the tax payer will have to solve.",liberals

h7px9g2,2021-08-04T06:16:12.000-07:00,"kenney outraged over trudeau's senate appointment as banff mayor karen sorensen appointed as independent i don't know if i'll change your mind, but in my opinion, the reason we need appointed individuals is because democracy is far from perfect.

democratically elected individuals usually fall in one of two categories:

\\- those elected due to the party they're in (i.e. when people vote for the party, not the person).

\\- those elected due to their hard work in convincing others they're the best option.

those who fall in the second category are very often very similar in their personalities.

at best: charismatic, good at campaigning, extroverted career politicians.

at worst: pure populists/demagogues.

you would never have someone like, a climate scientist, be able to join a democratically elected parliament unless he falls into the first category. and in that situation, he/she is not going to have that much of a say due to party whipping.

the idea of trudeau's independent advisory board for senate appointments is to establish a merit based criteria:

the person must be non partisan, must have solid knowledge of the legislative system, and must be an expert in whatever their field is. this allows for a much more diverse chamber with people from various backgrounds that represent the population more than an elected career politician.

i suggest you look at the list of trudeau's appointments and you will see some pretty good ones: former judges, academics, diplomats, chiefs of police, an art historian, conservationists, activists, journalists, a writer, etc.

and the reason for a lifetime appointment is twofold:

\\- focus on the long term, rather on doing what's gonna net you the most votes in the next election (another advantage of not having to worry about being re-elected).

\\- having a good paying, long term job helps against bribes. at least in theory =)

also, they don't need to rush to pass any laws and can truly take their time to scrutinize and find potential flaws on them that the lower chamber doesn't notice. that's why in practice the senate rarely blocks bills, it mostly works on fixing and amending them because they also understand the optics of an unelected group of people blocking a bill proposed by an elected group (since most of the population thinks that unelected == bad).

i'm not a huge fan of lifetime appointments, i think maybe a 10 year appointment should be good enough to serve the aforementioned purposes.

either way. sure, many former prime ministers have used this institution for \"unchecked cronyism\". but instead of calling for the abolishment of the senate, we should call for future prime ministers to follow and strengthen the independent advisory board for senate appointments. so that the senate can act as a true sober second thought and protect canadians against demagogues.",liberals

pepper spray is illegal yet bear spray is legal to carry even though they use the same chemicals. in canada, you can carry weapons for self defense but only against animals. firearms are prohibited for criminals yet they are running around shooting each other seemingly with impunity. so prohibition only reduces access for law abiding citizens.  

drug gangs account for 2/3 of all firearm homicides using mostly handguns, 85% of which are smuggled in from the us. criminals illegally purchase illegal handguns and then illegally smuggle them in from the us. in order to tackle this problem, the canadian government prohibited half of the semi-auto rifles owned by legal owners in canada. 

the liberals have focused on further restrictions on legal firearm owners and the results speak for themselves. the [firearm homicide rate has gone from 144 to 266 under the liberals](https://time.com/5461950/canada-homicide-rate-2017-climbs/). they have chosen to continue the drug war and continued to allow organized crime to dominate drugs and prostitution in this country. this liberal government's policies on public safety have been an abject failure.",liberals

h7q281w,2021-08-04T06:51:03.000-07:00,"canadians say it’s time to tackle the wealth gap &gt;is 70% of income fair?

it would depend on how high their income is. does someone making $20 million a year need anywhere close to that money? is them only making $10 million dollars a hardship? no. we'd have to tax them at a rate of like 99% to make them have actual hardship (actually nvm i just did the math and taxing someone making $20 million a year at 99% would still leave them with $200,000). taxing them at a rate of 70% would still leave them making $6 million a year — a staggering amount.

so for someone with that income 70% (or more) seems completely fair for them to give back to the society — someone who made less than that but that we'd still consider \"wealthy\" of course the % might end up being lower. but fundamentally i'm not bothered by a wealthy person paying over 50% of their income in taxes. why should i be? *they have millions of dollars are completely financially secure and many people are struggling and barely scraping by.*

and [as another poster said in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/oxuc83/canadians_say_its_time_to_tackle_the_wealth_gap/h7py2e9/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) the wealthy make a significant portion of their wealth through means not covered by income tax.

&gt;also why would property taxes be higher the point of property taxes is to pay for services to the property. it's not a tax just because you own or to punish owners.

honestly it's news to me that property taxes are supposed to solely be for paying services to the property. i guess that's a libertarian belief that people have, but that's completely not how we should be looking at them in my mind. that kind of approach seems reasonable in a situation of land abundance or for rural situations where the land itself is not super valuable but the cost to servicing it is, but in situations where land is scarce and super valuable taxing property at a rate to only cover servicing is a path towards extreme inequality.

of course the cost of servicing is part of it and in some locations it might be the majority, but imo property taxes also should be to obtain some value back to society from property owners based on the value of the land and property. it's surprising to me that this is controversial? land, especially in urban areas but just in general, is fundamentally scarce and those that own it (often due to no merit of their own) have a massive advantage over others in our society and make significant wealth from it (again often due to no special merit of their own that is proportional to the wealth they receive from it) and it's completely reasonable to me that we should be taxing it as a form of wealth in order to foster a healthy society and not one just dominated by wealthy landowners.

fptp favors the status quo so strongly because you need widespread support within a single riding in order to get any voice at all. the only reason minorities have any rights or voice under this system is because of the ethics and empathy of individuals.

if people are afraid of the ppc getting any power and voice in government because of the racism and discrimination they will promote and represent, how about we just let minorities actually have representation in government, instead of making them rely on the rest of us to caring about their issues in order for them to be represented.

---

thank you for clarifying. i think we are talking at cross purposes.  the assertion in the original article is that increasing funding for enforcement to the cra will increase revenue overall by collecting on owed taxes.  this is aside from any tax increase.

my comment was questioning why all parties don't just increase enforcement funding, since no-one likes cheats (even other cheats), and it has a net positive on revenue *without* increasing taxes.

for example, my company (canadian owned, and even partially employee owned ^(seize the means of production!) ) pays all of it's taxes.  if it turned out that our nearest competitor (foreign owned, a part of a major multinational) was *not* paying all of their owed taxes, i can't say i would be sad to see them caught.  not that i am asserting they are evading taxes, simply pointing out that a competitive advantage based on evading taxes only harms the more honest companies.  in fact, a predictable and stable environment is one of the most important factors in long term prosperity.  a wild west where you can out-compete your competitors by rolling the dice on what taxes to actually pay is not a long term benefit.  it only benefits short term charlatans and grifters.

---

separate, one point of clarification.  this did make me re-read the article more closely, and it seems that the liberal party did just this, increasing enforcement by $1.9 billion between 2015 and 2023, and it's *this* increased funding that is expected to have brought in a *total* of $13 billion in revenue by 2023 without any increase in taxes.

the ndp is proposing a *further* $100 million per year, which is expected to bring in a further $1.9 billion in revenue over 5 years.

the roi on the original $1.9 billion was over 6x, the next $500 million will recoup only 4x.  which is great, but it would seem that it is getting into diminishing returns. 

thus *my* original question was based on an incorrect assumption, other parties absolutely have done this.",liberals

it's an analogy sir wilfrid laurier used about incentivizing and convincing people rather than trying to get them to do something forcefully.

the problem is alienation and not feeling appropriately represented by canada and by the federalist parties. you aren't going to put an end to that problem by banning the bloc federally. you'll put an end to that problem by addressing why close to 800,000 to 1.8 million quebeckers feel that way in the first place and trying to fix it, truly, meaningfully.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i am not a member of any party, and have no side.

my comments were made generally and not personally directed at you. when i said **\"convince them that they are better off voting for a federalist party. persuade them, listen to them! get them to come over to your side\"**

i meant in the spirit of sunny ways, as i have now sorta clarified. get quebeckers to take off the coat of sovereignist sentiment federally by shining warm rays of sun down upon them, don't try to force it off with the winds.

also, to be frank, you do have a side in this particular debate. maybe you aren't a partisan  (i.e. ndp, green, conservative, liberal) but you've definitely expressed a position on the side of federalism and on the side that believes that the 800,000 to 1.8 million quebeckers who vote bloc should have that ability stripped away from them by way of constitutionally banning it.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;shrug, i disagree. i am not sure we are going to convince each other, and may just sort of get into repeating ourselves.

you are right that we aren't going to agree nor convince each other.

the highest mandate the bloc has ever received was 49% of the votes cast in québec in 1993. the lowest mandate the bloc received is 19% of the québec vote in 2011. in 2019, the bloc won 32.5% of the vote.

taking away an option through a constitutional change to ban the party, a party that close to 2/10 at minimum and 5/10 at a maximum of quebec voters have voted for consistently since 1993, in the in the 9 elections it's contested, to me is anti-democratic and disenfranchising.

&gt; people should still get their covid vaccine despite several eu countries pausing use of the oxford-astrazeneca jab amid concern about blood clots, the uk medicines regulator has said.
&gt;
&gt; the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency said evidence \"does not suggest\" the jab causes clots.
&gt;
&gt; dr phil bryan, vaccines safety lead at the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), said people \"should still go and get their covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so.\"
&gt;
&gt; \"we are closely reviewing reports but given the large number of doses administered, and the frequency at which blood clots can occur naturally, the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.\"
&gt;
&gt; prof andrew pollard, director of the oxford vaccine group, said there were \"huge risks\" from covid and vaccination saved lives.
&gt;
&gt; \"it's absolutely critical that we don't have a problem of not vaccinating people and have the balance of a huge risk - a known risk of covid - against what appears so far from the data that we've got from the regulators - no signal of a problem.\"
&gt;
&gt; he added there was \"very reassuring evidence that there is no increase in a blood clot phenomenon here in the uk, where most of the doses in europe been given so far.\"
&gt;
&gt; the european medicines agency (ema), which is carrying out a review into incidents of blood clots, said the vaccine's benefits continue to outweigh its risks.
&gt;
&gt; the ema said that, as of 10 march, there were just 30 reports of clots among almost five million people given the vaccine across europe [excluding the uk].

in horgan's defense, his government is preparing for a massive increase in spending, and i think horgan did have a point that, with the green party down to two mlas (weaver quit the leadership and the party, and sat as an independent), it made the confidence and supply agreement the ndp were relying on a very rickety bit of insurance. all it would have taken was for weaver to abandon his seat, and the government would have been in the nightmare scenario of a truly \"hung\" parliament in the fullest sense of the word. so wanting to untie himself from a confidence and supply agreement that threatened to deliver neither confidence or supply is understandable.

and of course, he had some of the highest personal ratings of any politician in canada, not to mention the bc ndp at record popularity. so his decision was, in part, self-serving, but also in part because the status quo of the agreement with the greens was becoming increasingly unreliable. and what would be worse than asking the lg to dissolve the legislature early? i'd say a vote of no confidence or a bizarre limbo where the speaker votes simply to continue debate (which technically is what a speaker is supposed to do when there's a tie in a vote), which would almost certainly lead to horgan being forcing to asked for dissolution, would have been worse.",liberals

fixing failures in law regarding estate sales or punishments is not about making unrelated laws even stricter, it's about fixing the laws to make sure they work as intended. even when those are closed, there will always be some laws that fail, even if they are well thought out or good laws. no law makes criminals stop what they are trying to do or stops idiots from accidentally doing things. drunk driving still happens, as do murders and the penalties for those is quite severe

you have to balance laws by looking at the burden it sets on the people and weighing how far you can go without creating undue burden on those affected. and every time something happens with a failure in a specific law regarding firearms, it is almost always never about fixing the existing law. it's always about increasing an unnecessary burden on those who were not involved in the failure of law because its far easier to communicate to the uninformed, easier to implement, and takes less time.",liberals

prior to our petition closing in jan 2018 ct was being handled exclusively at the municipal and provincial levels. the best they could do was refuse to grant business licenses (muni) and not fund through the provincial health authority. this is good &amp; all but it still relies on survivors going public, retraumatizing themselves, and opening themselves &amp; their families up to the abuses rampant in their communities. it's dangerous. 

by adding it to the criminal code a few things are accomplished:

a) it's a federal symbol of protection, acceptance, and support of the lgbtqia2s+ community. it matters. and it lays the groundwork for other countries to follow suit. 

b) the ban on profiting from &amp; advertising for creates an opportunity for law enforcement to go after these abusers without relying on trauma victims. this is a massive victory for survivors. 

c) it is quite common for children to be transported across borders to attend 'camps' where the most heinous abuses occur. this legislation creates a framework for cbsa. 

i am incredibly frustrated that the lpc's original response was to push it on the provinces. it took a lot of work &amp; an amazing senate to push it into the hoc. i'm angry about it being punted around twice. and i'm furious it's being used as a wedge issue. the cpc &amp; lpc have been using queer kids as a political football and it's gross as hell. i'm tired of apologizing to survivors for not getting it done. i'm tired of letting them down. 

it's fine if you don't see it or understand what this bill means.  it's a complicated topic that very few people even knew about. or were aware is an ongoing issue. 

but don't think for a minute that when this bill finally passes it won't do good. not just in canada, but across the world.",liberals

h6ttn4s,2021-07-27T23:30:25.000-07:00,"ndp leader promises to end boil-water advisories in indigenous communities it is unfortunate that there are still so many boil water advisories. i have spoken, in my ignorance i might add, that if we had more political will we could have gotten it done faster. i didn't realize previously just how difficult it is. i hadn't given the federal government enough credit for ending over 100 boil water advisories in indigenous communities across the country since being in power. 

there are a lot of variables involved when it comes time to ending a boil water advisory. it is not as easy as simply saying \"we are going to fix it\" and then going there and fixing the problem...especially in remote communities. 

i think that the liberals may have been a bit too ambitious with their initial promises, but they've made progress. what would the ndp do differently to get this done faster? 

also on an aside, even when the continuous boil water advisories end, there will still be a number of places which from time to time will have boil water advisories. gatineau for instance has a few across different neighbourhoods every year. it's usually for maintenance though. so i hope people keep in mind that some communities will slip back into having boil water advisories, but hopefully we'll be able to cut down on turn-around time for maintenance so that those communities that have the advisories can resolve them quickly as well.",liberals

h6tue1o,2021-07-27T23:36:38.000-07:00,"say no if justin trudeau asks for an election, jagmeet singh tells new governor general &gt;&gt; “should he attempt to request dissolution of parliament, we think it is important to reiterate that, as you are aware, one does not need to be granted in the absence of a loss of confidence in the house. thank you for your consideration.”

as written, this is a modern-day request to repeat the [king-byng affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king%e2%80%93byng_affair), only with an even less clear outcome.  

the king-byng affair involved the governor general (byng) exercising his reserve powers to refuse the requested dissolution of parliament, suggesting that _the opposition should get a chance to govern_.  from the piecemeal summary of singh's letter here in the star article, that is not the substance of today's request.  instead, singh wants the governor-general to refuse dissolution and let that be the end of it.

unfortunately, there is also a long-standing convention in westminster-style government that if the executive refuses the advice of their prime minister, the prime minister must resign.  the king-byng affair is itself precedent for this, and the idea goes back at least as far as the [bedchamber crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bedchamber_crisis), where uk conservative robert peel refused to form government because queen victoria declined his request to replace some of her whig-affiliated ladies in waiting.

if trudeau asks for an election but the governor general does as singh asks and refuses, convention would dictate that trudeau resign.  then what?  which party would be able to form government?  which party would _want_ to form government under those absurd conditions?  with no likely candidate, we'd end up in an election anyway &amp;ndash; just with a more politicized monarchy for it.

in reality, of course, singh does not want to cripple the monarchial structure of the canadian government, and he does not seriously expect the governor-general to heed his letter.  instead, the point of the letter is the leaking of it, leading to articles such as this one where singh gets to be concerned about an election without having to directly make his own statements.  call me a traditionalist, but i think it's best to make one's electoral case (here regarding opportunistic, unnecessary elections) directly to the voters.",liberals

and marriages can have all manner of rules about sexual partners; 'cheating' is no longer prosecuted because we know it to not necessarily be a civil or moral issue at all. there are too many ways to live happily and freely on this earth - we can't call things \"immoral\" unless we're sure they cause harm - and that's why we don't prosecute adultery as a crime anymore.

while we should never have gotten to this point, it is clear ending the clean drinking crisis in indigenous communities is a priority for our current government, and they are committed to resolving this issue.

without raising the price, no. that's what was the focus of the pbo report - the liberals were wrong and priced the per/tonne too low to meet our targets. now was that due to incompetence or recognizing the political costs of ramping up more quickly than they proposed, well that's up to our own interpretations.

&gt;the cpc also proposes a slew of new measures to encourage a reduction in emissions that don't rely on increasing the carbon tax. 

those measures were wholly lacklustre imho. the 'personal savings account' looks needlessly complex and rewards people for buying more hydrocarbon-based fuel and requires specific 'green initiatives' for the money to be spent on, a strange incentive to reduce emissions. $1 billion for ev manufacturing? $1 billion for hydrogen? at least they've set more ambitious targets for industy's obps at $170/tonne but even that's contingent on other states committing too, not exactly ambitious.

&gt;but none of that is relevant to the lpc attacking the cpc over fixing a less ambitious target than the lpc's when the lpc's policy isn't actually going to meet either of them.

the liberals at least saw the current pricing system was insufficient and are going to be raising the pricing to get closer to paris commitments. i can see your point about hypocrisy and maybe my own personal values concerning the importance of action on climate change are contributing to this, however, i do view the ndp &amp; liberals as being clearly ahead of the cpc on climate initiatives and think criticism is valid even if the former don't have perfect plans.",liberals

if i am it's pretty sad my math skills are still better than yours :)

&gt; a 15% chance is about 1 chance in 8

uhhh no. 1 in 8 would be a 12.5 percent chance.  it's actually a 1 in 6.6 chance rounded, which is why i said it's close to russian roulette which is 1 in 6.  wow - you suck at logic and math :)

&gt;and 100% completely preventable if you are a prisoner isolated in your cell.

ummmmmm - so... if that were true, wouldn't it tend to agree with my point that we shoudln't be giving them vaccines before we give older people who have a much higher chance of dying the vaccine? 

thanks for making my point for me :)  did you forget what you were trying to argue? i think you got a little confused there. (it's duck season btw :) )

&gt;frankly i'll happily accept a 1 in 8 chance of a prisoner dying

ummm... the 1 in 8 (actually 6.6 if you'd done the math right) is the person who isn't in jail in this example. :)  the 1 in 10000 guy is the one in jail :)  you've completely gotten turned around :)

&gt; there is no reason why incarcerated prisoner, regardless of their age or health status, should receive a vaccine ahead of even one free canadian who wants it.

well that's not true of course. it would be entirely logical to say that if we are basing the vaccine distribution on highest risks then a 70 year old should get it before a 50 year old regardless of whether they are in jail or not. people in jail must still interact with other people and in fact there have been cases in jails. if you were under the impression that they just put people in a cell and that person never sees anyone else ever again until they're released, that's really not how it works. 

so there may be reasons you don't like, but there are logically defensible reasons. there is a duty of care when you incarcerate someone, which is why we bother giving them food and heat the places. 

my point was that a person shouldn't get inoculated just because they are in jail.  there is no point, as i said, giving a vaccine to a 30 year old in jail who has almost no risk vs a 70 year old out of jail who has a very high risk of death.",liberals
