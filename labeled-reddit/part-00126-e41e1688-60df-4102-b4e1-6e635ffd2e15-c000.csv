houj0g1,2021-12-16T07:44:51.000-08:00,"trudeau calls for ban on foreign property ownership, blind bidding and \"renovictions\" a ban on foreign ownership is a partial fix to a larger problem.

the root problem is that investing money in property is lucrative, and the ultra wealthy are dumping tons of their money into property as a means of tax evasion. 

so, yes, banning foreign ownership is good, but it isn't the whole game and it does nothing for nationals who are doing the same thing. banning foreign ownership in new zealand didn't curb the problem because there's too much money in nz itself buying up property.

so long as people see housing as an investment rather than \"a place to live\" we haven't fixed the issue. things like airbnb are making multiple home ownership lucrative to even the everyday buyer, and so there is a quantitative squeeze. corporations are buying up homes, and that adds to the squeeze. housing prices are going up so fast that for many it's better to leave the home vacant so they can flip it on a dime as needed, this adds to the squeeze. and of course, the fewer homes available, the more the prices go up anyhow, create a virtuous/vicious cycle feeding back into the previous problems.

we need to take profit out of housing full stop. tax the ever living crap out of them, make loopholes painful to actually get through (since as many point out you can't stop people from cheating, we don't have to make it easy). make multiple home ownership a rarity rather than commonplace. yes, it would be nice to have that third home as a vacation cottage, but lets make the economy of scale favour first time buyers first, and then let whoever can afford second and third homes work it out after that. if that means a greatly increasing tax and costs, so be it.

the problem is that investing in property pays off. the hard truth canadians are going to have to accept is that their home shouldn't be their \"nest egg\", it should just be the place they live while they save up their nest egg via other means.",liberals

the charter exists to protect people from tyranny of the majority. as do many constitutions around the world. i get it, quebec didn't sign the constitution (for good reasons), but tyranny of the majority is still a bad thing. such as when the religious had the majority and used it to needlessly persecute people.

&gt;if you don’t like the laws of quebec then don’t live in quebec.

very nice thing to tell people whose home is in quebec, who live in quebec, who were born in quebec. all for the nonsense not-actually-a-real-problem reason that apparently a teacher or government worker wearing a headscarf or a kippah etc. will somehow roll back the clock and turn quebec into a religious theocracy that persecutes people?

there's not actually a risk of that happening, so what's the point of the policy? quebec is not going back to religious persecution, it's obviously not a risk, so why does this need to be done? the only persecution that's happening now and that is at risk of getting worse is secularists persecuting others due to their own overreacting completely-out-of-proportion ideology. the only risk i see is secular fundamentalism having power and persecuting people with it, not religious fundamentalism gaining it.

in new zealand (a two tiered country), there's a practice known as \"cream skinning\" basically if the private sector finds that the treatment they need to provide is too costly cuz it will harm their shareholders' marginal profits slightly, they send it back to the public one. the public sector is literally subsidizing the private sector here, it doesn't address the costs. how does having profits address our health care issues? how does havingg a bunch of useless, unnecessary, shareholders leech off of my hard earned money and my need for health care provide any material good to society?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the profits part is important, it can't be so much that no one opens any medical centres, but it also can't so little that it barely affects the public healthcare pot. 

why do we need profits? making an inelastic good for profit doesn't benefit anyone but the shareholders.   


&gt;the profits part is important, it can't be so much that no one opens any medical centres, but it also can't so little that it barely affects the public healthcare pot. all operating costs, including employees, rent, tools, etc would be excluded, just leaving the money the owners/stock holders take home to be split into the pot. probably something around 40-60%, depending on how much profits are made.

and how will they make profit? the most successful insurance companies america are successful by the fact that they deny a lot of claims. a fully public system would cost less over a hybrid one. privatized systems cost way more. for instance, switzerland is very privatized, and they have high cost sharing (average gp visit is \\~165$cad there), deductibles, and not as generous coverage. new zealand, again, hasn't had their wait times decrease, but actually [increase](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315337533_a_two-tier_health_care_system_the_new_zealand_story). even with govt reforms to the public system, their wait times are similar to that of canada. australia with their 2 tier system has seen their wait times gradually increase over the past [years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7235968/).    


it still amazes me how people think that 2 tier care will \"alleviate pressure\" off of the public system when they do not even realize that this can cause a brain drain in the public sector and cause many doctors to go priv, making our wait times increase more. 2 tier care does not address these big issues our system has:

2. undermining

okay, but how does that help the poorer people? health care being for profit is a great evil, and it causes problems. and for profit ones weren't luxurious even, if they can't even bother to look after old people. public systems can look good, if it's maintained, funded, and managed properly, instead of constant austerity and defunding by neoliberals.

&gt;it’s low-income ltc’s are the ones that need some protection… they’re not all bad. for starters we shouldn’t allow foreign investors to own ltc’s.

1. yes, foreigners should not own this stuff

task defiant didn't ask whether you can afford more... or whether as the rich parent you think it's a good idea to jump the line... obviously you do, although you did a great job explaining why you as the rich parent believe it is in your favour.

lets take the original question a little farther though based on your logic. task\\_defiant's family lives in poverty, and is unable to foot (sorry... had to) the bill for the $15k surgery. your family can. while your family can pay out 15k to save your son 40k in school, task\\_definat's family cannot, and thus loses out on that 40k scholarship. in this way, you, having more money, are able to save yourself even more money. while task\\_defiant's family, which has few means, is unable to help themselves out of poverty by having their son go to college on a scholarship. in this way, the rich get richer, and the poor stay poor.

lets think about the concept of \"no one is more important\". if that were truly the case, then the \"system\" (whatever the hell that may be in this analogy) should evaluate both cases on their merits. two boys. two broken ankles. one can get surgery sooner than the other. but which should it be? maybe, if both boys are equally important, the one who will get the most net benefit should get it sooner! if your family has a net worth of... lets say 500,000 (is this a small number? who cares, it sets the point), and task\\_defiant's family has a net worth of 1,000 (this is actually the case for a lot of canadians), then who benefits more from the 40k scholarship? for your family, you lose out on 25k, which is about 5% of your net worth. for task\\_defiant's family, they lose out on 4,000% of their net worth... so, if no one is more important, surely we'd want the family who would benefit the most relative to their current context to have the surgery quicker no?",conservatives

&gt; no they absolutely have not. we had elections in 2006, 2008 and 2011, you know. the fixed election “law” has as much authority as a law that says the pm must have blue eyes.

&gt;and 9/10 provinces have ignored their “law” and held elections off the four-year schedule because those “laws” are in no way actually binding and the tenth, saskatchewan, has amended theirs so they can go longer! you say i am not knowledgeable on the subject matter but you are getting this 100% wrong.

that's not what the law says. these laws do not make us a congressional system, they do not abolish the parliamentary system which is part of the constitution. they only schedule elections for majority governments (or cotillions able to last 4 years) as minorities always loose the confidence of the house. the 2015 election and 2019 election were held 4 years after their previous at the scheduled date in october as they were majority governments therefore no motion of confidence. that is what the fixed date election law calls for. without it they'd of gone 5 years.

what ever i'm clearly arguing against a child here given the maturity of your arguments and lack of political and constitutional knowledge. you're what 16?

&gt; we had elections in 2006, 2008 and 2011

&gt;mandatory penalties may adversely affect recidivism. whatever one may think about the wisdom of manda- tory sentencing, it is undeniable that such penalties serve to increase the length of time that offenders serve in prison by restricting the discretion of judges and corrections/parole offi- cials. by doing so, these policies may have a criminogenic effect. a 2002 review conducted by leading cana- dian criminologists involved a meta- analysis of 117 studies measuring various aspects of recidivism. the researchers concluded that longer periods in prison were “associated with a small increase in recidivism” and that “the results appear to give some credence to the prison as ‘schools of crime’ perspective.”

hngmdfh,2021-12-05T22:26:12.000-08:00,"no evidence liberals knew appeal over residential school payments was dropped: miller for those who don’t know the backstory on this:

&gt; under one aspect of the indian residential schools settlement agreement, a group of 48 catholic church entities, including dioceses and religious orders, agreed to make three forms of financial restitution to survivors and indigenous organizations. they would pay $29-million in cash, provide $25-million in church and religious in-kind services and make “best efforts” to raise $25-million in a national fundraising campaign. to handle these payments, the church set up a special organization, the corporation of catholic entities party to the indian residential schools settlement (ccepirss).

&gt;but by 2014 the church had yet to collect more than $21-million of its fundraising commitment, and still owed $1.6-million on its cash commitment. (by then, the church was saying it had already fulfilled the in-kind promise.)

&gt;when the government became aware of the $1.6-million cash shortfall, it took the church’s corporation to court. in filings previously obtained by the globe, federal lawyers alleged the catholic church had improperly redirected funds meant for survivors towards fees for lawyers, auditors and accountants. a globe story in late august revealed that the church’s corporation spent $6.46-million – roughly 27 per cent of its total funds – on expenses.

&gt;lawyers for the government further alleged that the church’s lawyers were in a conflict of interest because they sat on the board of ccepirss. the government also argued that the $25-million of in-kind services had not been audited, meaning the services’ value could not be verified. in late september, experts questioned whether the in-kind commitment had been met after the globe acquired a list describing the services performed.

&gt;during the case, gordon kuski, a lawyer for the catholic corporation, and alexander gay, a government lawyer, eventually agreed the church would pay out $1.2-million.

&gt;but the newly released court records suggest a misunderstanding soon emerged over the terms of the settlement, culminating in a pitched battle based on each side’s interpretation of various emails, letters and phone calls.

&gt;according to mr. kuski’s emails, he was negotiating for an all-encompassing deal: in exchange for the $1.2-million, the church would be released from its cash commitment, its fundraising commitment, and any outstanding in-kind service obligations. mr. gay, meanwhile, expected a much narrower settlement that only addressed the outstanding $1.6-million.

&gt;as negotiations wore on, the church became increasingly convinced a deal had been struck. on sept. 17, 2014, mr. kuski sent an optimistic message to two board members of the catholic corporation. “we are on the verge!!,” he wrote.

&gt;the government, meanwhile, believed the deal’s terms were still being negotiated.

&gt;in october, mr. kuski sent mr. gay a letter warning him that the $1.2-million was intended to cover all of the church’s financial requirements. “that was the deal,” he wrote. the outstanding money for the national fundraising campaign was a moot point, he said, because the church had already made its “best efforts” to raise the funds, as required under the residential schools settlement. “i think we agree that it appears pursuing any such complaint or concern would be fruitless,” he wrote.

&gt;the church did not want to become embroiled in an expensive legal dispute, mr. kuski continued. and, even if that were to happen, “the catholic entities and ccepirss have no funds to pay for the cost of representation,” he wrote.

&gt;after that, exchanges between the church and government became more acrimonious.

&gt;“the delay in finalizing the settlement is completely unacceptable,” mr. kuski wrote nearly a month later. he threatened to ask the judge to order the deal be finalized.

&gt;mr. gay fired back later that day.

&gt;“we have not been able to reach agreement on the terms of the release. i have explained this to you numerous times and have advised you that the matter is still under consideration,” he wrote. “your suggestion that there is an agreement is disturbing on many fronts and an unfortunate move on your part.”

&gt;with that, the government and the church were at an impasse. for the next six months, the court case – which began as a government complaint over a missing $1.6-million – became wholly consumed with the legal question of whether a deal had been struck. and then, in 2015, the church emerged victorious.

&gt;the now-public court files show that the church “out-maneuvered everyone,” prof. turpel-lafond said. “they were discharged of their obligations through the sheer aggressiveness of their tactics. this was largely legal trickery and not a substantive consideration of the obligations and whether they were met.”

it's going to take forever to fix the prison system though. nobody cares about criminals, no lawyers are fighting for this, no police officers believe in reducing punishments and focussing on éducation and rehab. so who's left? a bunch of progressive nerds who seem to want to fix the problem but are fighting a behemoth. the only reason this bill is coming from the liberals is because the states is having a reckoning with their criminal justice system, and nobody is paying attention really.",liberals

the old catch 22, can’t build transit because of low density and can’t increase density due to lack of transit. realistically though i think the complications from increasing density won’t be realized until you’re at the point where you can support a transit station, so i don’t think it will really be a barrier to development. you can also pull a japan/hong kong and announce the development years in advance so people develop the surrounding area in anticipation.

this is also false, we need to borrow so much money to fund our cities because our cities are rapidly growing. the costs to maintain a city are relatively stable and  municipalities are generally not allowed to borrow for operational deficits, only for capital assets. so maintaining a highway, sewer system, transit line, these things don't result in borrowing. building a new transit line? requires capital and debt.

building because we're going to have two million more people in the gta? definitely requires debt because the tax revenue of those two million people isn't here yet.

&gt;discussions about housing prices are a completely different discussion. for the purpose of the discussion we're having, sprawling suburban developments cost too much to maintain for the taxes they pay, which is why cities rely on transfer payments rather than property taxes to maintain the services they have, let alone expand.  

cities and towns rely on transfer payments because cities don't collect income tax. doesn't matter how dense a city is, toronto could not provide all of the services it does on property tax alone, particularly if it had to fund the other elements. 

&gt;if developers want to keep building car dependent suburbs, then the only way they can be sustainably funded is if services are scaled back.

you posted earlier a total swing of $1,100 annually. this is negligible. you could simply modify those tax rates and maintain the exact services you call unsustainable. whats more it would be strictly better for the citizens of toronto to sprawl, lower housing costs, then raise taxes, than your proposal of sky high housing costs but at least we saved a few dollars on a sewer pipe.

what matters is:
- how much does it cost to live in the city
- what amenities do i get from living in the city
- what disamenities do i get from living in the city

on climate change, it pains me, but the liberal plan is better due to being more concrete on the details then the ndp plan, which says a lot about what it wants to do but not how we'll get there. we have independent economists and climate scientists to tell us the liberal plan should work. the fight to get a carbon tax across canada was long, and gruelling, and i don't know if the ndp had the systemic experience to get it done.

if its childcare, the liberals have actually gone through with agreements with provinces this time. that makes it not like pharmacare - its in the budget, the money is allocated, its going to happen (if they aren't ousted). its no longer an empty promise.

on handling the pandemic, i think we can all reasonably agree the government did well.

and finally, on housing, the ndp plan is not super realistic and is single-faceted. the liberal plan is much more multifaceted, and they actually *did* have progress on the housing before the pandemic - housing was flat between 2017 and 2020 until the pandemic nuked it. i really like the proposed policies in the liberal platform, particularly rent to own and the carrot and stick approach they have been using on the provinces, applied to munipalities to combat nymbyism.

the trudeau government isn't perfect, but it absolutely has delivered on many of its planks, moreso then it can seem when we're all mad about the pandemic. i am disappointed with them for pharmacare and some other things, but they have generally gotten results with the pandemic (look at that flood of vaccines), with climate change in getting the policies in place (you won't drop ghg overnight, legislation takes time to have an effect) and in pushing childcare even if its mid-rollout.",liberals

you’ve also condensed so much down to two distinct situations with little context around them. abortion positions today are not the same as a racist costume years prior, these aren’t even comparable. more importantly the cpc pretends this issue isn’t on the table, while pretending it is not a serious issue of their base, which it definitely is. controlling women’s choices as a matter of policy is terrifying.

i agree with you that the majority of people in canada do not want a homogeneous society. but that hasn't stopped ignorant columnists  from pushing their unwanted version of cultural homogeneity on others, and that's the issue here. 

&gt;you must not have been anywhere outside quebec if you believe this! 

i'm a new brunswick acadian. i have lived outside québec all my life. i keep up with francophone and anglophone news from across the country daily, from print to tv to podcasts. i make sure to be well-versed in the diverse views of different communities. my observation has been that english canadians have little understanding of french canada, and that both english and french canadians have an even worst understanding of indigenous communities. 

&gt;this has been the reality for generations of official multiculturalism and immigration everywhere except quebec . 

eh, there's been increased immigration to québec just as there's been to the rest of the country. montréal in particular has become more diverse. 

and as for your claim on multiculturalism, that illustrates a lack of knowledge about québec. québec has encouraged interculturalism for as long as english canada has encouraged multiculturalism. interculturalism and multiculturalism are models that have many things in common, such as promoting that immigrants keep their culture and culturally exchange with domestic-born citizens. the one key difference is that interculturalism plays an active role in promoting the host culture as well, whilst multiculturalism adopts a libertarian attitude that assumes that the host culture will naturally rub off on newcomers. both of these models reject assimilation and are pluralistic models that seek a successful integration. 

multiculturalism is seen by many francophones and indigenous peoples as diluting the multi-national nature of canada and of promoting their assimilation into the dominant english canadian society. it's why it's been rejected by québec since the constitutional imposition of 1982. it's why first nations mutinied against trudeau and chrétien's white paper proposal (à propos, i suggest following indigenous journalist robert jago). national minorities in canada want to have their own institutions and keep control of their sociocultural matters.  it's an affirmation of nationhood, not a rejection of pluralism. 

&gt;it’s quebec that seeks that homogeneity in their culture, not the roc.

that's not true at all. as stated before, the québec model of interculturalism is pluralistic. moreover, québec doesn't care if the rest of canada share their model or implement another one like what english canada is doing with multiculturalism. meanwhile, the english canadian political media class sees any cultural deviance from the norms it seeks to impose as a threat and plunges into hysteria whenever other models are preferred. there is many anglo columnists who have a sense of moral superiority about their viewpoints as if they're the ones with all the answers and who think it's their mission to eradicate francophone and indigenous sociocultural norms.",liberals

hkacjsu,2021-11-11T11:10:17.000-08:00,"ontario liberals pledge to cancel highway 413, use money to build, repair schools instead oh god no.  large sites like those require even more infrastructure due to their huge frontage and more intensive use, and most receive tax breaks from the cities where they're built because politicians are obsessed with 'attracting jobs' and so businesses shop around for the best deal possible.

i want to enjoy the privacy of a private island, but if i bought one i'd have to figure out my own power, water, and sewage solutions, and once i'd made it livable i'd have to pay somebody to even bring me supplies, so instead i live close to the rest of society.

the problem with car dependent suburbs (without even discussing climate change) is that car travel downloads all the negative externalities to other people.  people like living in a quiet, safe, and private neighborhood, yet when they drive into the city they're subjecting urban residents to the very things they themselves are avoiding.  they bring noise (roads can generate over 80 db of sound, as loud as a hair dryer, just from tires rolling along the asphalt), they're dangerous because they're allowed to travel at high speeds around people who just want to live and raise their kids, and those people are imposing themselves into the lives of others.  suburbs are explicitly built to keep out cars, but the suburban lifestyle imposes cars on urban dwellers.  would you still want to live in a suburban neighborhood if the road in front of your house was a major thoroughfare with traffic 24/7, rather than the suburban default of a maze and cul-de-sacs that discourage through traffic?  most car-light urban design merely replicates that suburban ethos of discouraging trips through urban neighborhoods and providing alternatives other than a car that reach destinations faster than driving.

everybody wants to get where they're going, but in designing cities for cars first that luxury is reserved only for people who can afford a car and a place to park it.  anybody that can't afford a car, or anybody that can't (or isn't allowed) to drive is already stuck at home with our current urban design patterns.  i don't know about you, but i was ecstatic when i got my license because for the first time ever i could actually go somewhere without begging my parents to take me.  i would've loved a bus or a bike lane when i was a kid.

yes, cars are impractical for costco runs, but driving half an hour to buy a month's worth of groceries at once is pretty unfathomable for most urban centers.  there aren't many costcos near city centers, just smaller, more accessible grocery stores where people can pick up a couple of days of food at a time.  when i lived downtown the grocery store was between my transit stop and my home so i'd just drop in on my way home from work if the larders were looking bare.

driving already impacts mobility.  traffic slows everybody down.  roads split people from their destinations, especially with 'jay-walking' laws forcing people to find an 'acceptable' place to cross a road.  i'd like to ride a bus that isn't slowed down by a bunch of single occupancy cars, or ride a bike in a dedicated bicycle lane rather than a painted gutter shared with cars, or walk on a sidewalk without loud noises, polluted air, and something other than cars to look at, yet somehow suggesting these options are painted as a 'war on the car' because they might make urban life better by inconveniencing suburban drivers.  all i want is a balance such that urban dwellers aren't forced to bare all of the negatives externalities of people who choose suburban living.",liberals

i'm not saying their floor crossing was completely justifiable, but it wasn't a different scenario, wilson had been kicked out, and bruce heyer leaving the ndp damaged his political career more than helping it. the ndp are a lot more competitive in thunder bay than the greens are. it wasn't a cynical political move in the same way jenica atwin crossed the floor.

societies need police. abolishing the police is an insane idea spread on social media that is probably being boosted by chinese and russian disinformation operatives.

like it should be so clear to everyone our enemies are spreading anti-police propaganda online to break trust in policing and cause us all problems.

so on that side, i'm with conservatives.

however, this movement in the us is bigger than blm. i've read the reports, i've listened carefully to black people share their experiences.

obviously, policing has issues that needs to be addressed. i've read accounts of people on the street who were misidentified as criminals but never resisted arrest, and were shot and paralyzed forever.

the fellow who got shot and paralyzed received no compensation for the enormous medial bills he has to pay for the rest of his life because of police protections.

his family will have to all work to care for him and feed him and wipe him everytime he uses the toilet for the rest of his life because he has no money or compensation to pay for these things and can no longer work his job.

trying to dismiss all black people because of what some whiny conservative media pundits say is dumb.

ben shapiro, tucker carlson, candace owens, all these people know nothing and have no expertise. they have no value to society and shouldn't be treated as anything other than idiotic clowns dancing for conservatives' money.

policing is a complex subject, and you'd have to be living in another reality not to see there are obvious problems that need addressing.

if a black person with decades of experience living in her community *tells you* what she has seen and experienced, it would be insane for anyone to dismiss them as all crazy.

we need to build trust between police and the citizens. we need human connection. we can't be arrogant and dismiss all black people as mindless animals who don't know what's good for them like trump did.

no. that is not how politics in a democracy works.

i am not afraid to criticize blm as you see. but i won't support the way conservatives dehumanize and dismiss other people's views based on their own virtually non-existent understanding of the situation.

blm shouldn't be a partisan issue. we should all be able to listen to all sides, to blacks *and whites* who've experienced police brutality. and we should listen to our police and legal experts and everyone we can.

politics is the art of listening, not fighting. conservatives need to *listen* to protestors. they don't all want to eradicate police. many just want peace and good will between police and our communities.

sadly, conservatives have chosen more to ignore everyone who doesn't agree with them, and wall themselves off in their own fox news-bubble.

this doesn't work. trump tried to immediately call out troops onto the streets when the protests first started so he could use american soldiers to shoot black families and exterminate them.

trump was truly a sick deranged violent man, and his views have infected too many conservatives. treating blacks like this is a massively bad idea and will only make conservatives become more isolated and extreme in my view.

edit: i would add, after the republican party's white supremacist terrorist attack on the us capitol on jan 6, it is even more obvious conservatives are scapegoating blacks to justify their own freakish behavior.

i got problems with blm, but let's not even pretend that conservatives haven't just made everything worse by what they've done.

we all saw what happened at the capitol. no one believes conservatives actually care about black people *or* the police they brutally beat.

trump never even acknowledged the police who bravely fought back his terrorist attack. conservatives do not care about police, just want to use this issue to rile themselves up.

i get that was america, this is canada, but it is clear how much their insanity is sweeping over our borders.",conservatives

housing affordability will definitely be a biggest issue (it already is just no one listens to our age demo) -- especially on conservative spectrum as cost of living / economy seems to be a big issue for conservative-leaning voters. anything that can be interpreted as racist/xenophobic gets a big negative reaction (i.e harper's attempt to cozy to quebec with burqa stuff). gta/gva isn't necessarily socially liberal (a lot of these families are from more conservative places) and doug ford won the immigrant vote by using issues like sex-ed to win communities (islamic/indian especially) that often go liberal. acceptance of lgbt is obviously high but its not black/white (i.e people may not want their kids being taught that they can be any gender at school).

honestly? not that much will change, priorities will change but there won't be any major structural shifts -- aside from maybe housing affordability on the right and rise of sjw-style rhetoric over traditional economic leftism on the left. climate change stuff is overblown, its a left issue and always will be. conservatives should just try to frame climate change within basic environmentalism and focus on more tangible stuff like greenspace, provincial parks, clean water etc -- as long as you don't come off as environment-destroying and science-denying hicks we will be ok. young centrist/right-leaning demographics just want to have a good job, have more affordable life (make that same money go further) and gradually cpc will focus on that.",conservatives

absolutely. but the question is, in a situation where our resources are finite, which they are, is this a good use of them?

the \"budget officer says liberals' gun buyback could cost up to $756 million\"

756 million to save how many lives through this buy back? that's not even talking about tax revenue lost from the gun industry, hunting industry, and tourism due to people coming here to hunt.

i personally think that money could be put to a better use. we could see better results. we could attack the root cause of gun violence. how far could 756 million + millions in tax revenue a year go towards the homeless crisis? or the drug crisis?

in a perfect infinite world, sure, ban guns. in reality though, we're allocating resources that we should using in more dire places.

756 million spent on this is 756 million not spent on drug epidemic, homeless epidemic, or \"police measures to curtail the use of guns so that people who use these guns are deterred from using them.\"

even if you are anti-gun, and think every gun needs out of canada. that's fair. i can get that point of view. but you should still be against what the liberals are doing, because we're spending upwards of 756 million + millions a year in tax revenue to address something that quite honestly, isn't the biggest, or close to the biggest, problem in canada.

i'm not disagreeing that we should try, but it's something that we'll have to go into with the understanding that this is what the government is going to be doing for the next several years, and i don't blame trudeau or harper, or chretien for wanting to focus on other priorities.",liberals

we should also look at the conditions when leaders courtesy is given. most cases the governing party has a clear majority. the leader runs in a ridding currently held by that party. in many case, a mp from the leaders party steps down so the leader can run in a by-election.

the ndp have never followed the convention, so ndp leaders have and never should received the courtesy.

the green leader is running in a ridding that has never been held by the greens, and more importantly is currently and previously been held by the liberals. so paul does not deserve the courtesy. in fact if the courtesy should  be considered at all, based on history, if and only if paul were to run in may's ridding (and i know that is not going to happen).",liberals
