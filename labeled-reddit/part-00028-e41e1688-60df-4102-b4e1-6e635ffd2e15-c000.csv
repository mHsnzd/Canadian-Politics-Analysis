outside of federally regulated industries (airlines, rail, etc.) they couldn't do it even if they wanted to. that is, mandating paid sick leave paid for by the employer. from a jurisdictional standpoint i suppose they could do what they opcs are asking them to do and just turn the csrb into paid sick days via direct cash transfer from the government (though i could very well be wrong here). however there isn't much point for the feds to get involved.

first of all, if it's government supplemented it's going to be a permanent line item. the tories are already giving the lpc a tough time for their spending so trudeau and co really have no desire to make the budget any bigger than it already is. 

secondly, they'd have to implement it canada wide to get around the possible jurisdictional issues and to avoid every other province, especially québec, getting pissed off that ontario's getting special support because we suck. the line item problem is multiplied roughly by ten at this point.

thirdly, why the hell would trudeau want to spend huge amounts of cash just so a premier, who has spent half of his tenure trying to sabotage trudeau's agenda fighting the carbon tax, can get out from under the fact that his ideology is at odds with reality (political and material)?  besides, doug ford's incompetence is doing real damage in ontario to the conservative brand at the federal level and the lpc are the real beneficiaries of that. yes they are separate but voters don't always see it so clean cut. never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.

e.g. can't find a public cpe? here's an offset (refundable) to you that makes it cost about the same. 

quebec's system is great because there's a lot of high quality seats, and there's also a lot of seats in the right places because the market is allowed to be there, and the two together bring the cost down and the quality up. don't like waiting in line for 3 years or for longer waiting for a new centre to be built? try out one of a half dozen competitors for the same fee. the rebates are even monthly (not with taxes at end of year) so people who need the money can make rent.

mixing public, not for profit, and private is a great model and the cpc won't touch it because 'ewww nanny state'. kenney has already rejected it outright for alberta.",liberals

in the 1970s through 90s the federal government used to contribute so much toward building social housing in this country that 10% of new builds were social housing. then jean chretien came into power and with his austerity budgets of the early 1990s he got the federal government completely out of anything to do with housing. the amount of social housing starts plummeted as the provinces and municipalities were left to start from scratch.   


we had decades of under development of social housing because the feds walked away. some kudos to trudeau for re-engaging here, but he hasn't done nearly enough.

you're right that he isn't a climate scientist, but being an energy economist myself i think labelling him as a \"supporter of fossil fuels\" is neither accurate, fair or helpful.

while i'm not very fond of his overall assessment criteria (he focuses on whether the proposed policies will meet the parties' own targets, but is that the most important thing?) he makes a good point that it is difficult to model the ndp's climate plan because it is so vague.

the suggestion that only climate scientists can inform discussion on what policies we should use to accelerate decarbonization is foolish. climate scientists understand how emissions affect the environment. economists and policy analysts understand how people and firms respond to prices, policies and how they adopt new technologies. ignoring the people who study the interface of policies, technology and markets seems like a bad idea when you're wanting to change peoples' and firms' energy production and consumption.

if energy economists are slagged by climate scientists for being 'pro-fossil fuel' we are in for a rough ride, indeed.",liberals

gmi0nnm,2021-02-07T04:22:03.000-08:00,"if these 3 vaccines are approved, inoculations in the spring could double in canada i disagree with the top level poster, but i've also been disappointed by the trudeau government's response and thought plenty of things were errors as we went along. 

the first, and most glaring, was our initial investment in and reliance on the cansino vaccine. cansino is a chinese company that was developing a vaccine. but it should have been evident to the government that working with a chinese company on this issue would be risky. canada and china have had a poor relationship for much of the last decade, and that relationship only soured more this year between the pandemic and continued meng extradition proceedings. it was predictable that the chinese government may interfere with the proposed trial, and that's exactly what happened. 

the second is a knock-on effect from the first. because we relied on the proposed cansino vaccine, we delayed building partnerships with companies like moderna, pfizer, and astrazeneca. ultimately, we managed to sign deals with most leading candidates, but they were later on than we could have gotten if we used the summer to build those relationships, rather than hoping china would suddenly decide to cooperate after it became clear in may they were not. if we'd done that, doses would be prioritized to canada ahead of other countries (since they're roughly prioritized based on purchase date), and we'd be better off.

the third is the vaccination program. it hasn't been well organized or thought out. part of that is a provincial failure, but the liberals easily could have dictated processes if they wanted to. they abdicated that responsibility to the provinces, who have struggled to effectively and efficiently deliver the vaccine to citizens. 

the fourth is the recent decision to produce vaccines domestically. that's a great idea. it's also one that could have been started in february when it became clear there was a global pandemic that would upend the world. if that project had been launched in february, we'd have an up-and-running vaccination production facility right now (assuming the same timeline the government put forward now). 

fifth, border restrictions. they should have been harsher. anyone traveling for non-essential purposes since at least april should have been forced to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days. the half measure of quarantining at home was useless. the further half measure of quarantining until you get a negative covid test domestically is useless. we know what works, and it's been obvious for months – a full quarantine in a hotel. trudeau has failed to mandate that, and it's a shame. 

finally, the messaging has been atrocious. at least some anti-mask advocates are driven by the fact that the government lied about masks being ineffective last year. the scientific community knew masks were likely effective, we've known that for decades about this kind of virus. they lied because of concerns about shortages, which is totally fair. but there's other ways to deal with that. you could legislate all shipments of medical masks to retailers halted while encouraging people to use non-medical face coverings. you could simply ask people nicely to use non-medical face coverings (which is what we literally do now). or whatever. but lying to the public shakes public confidence in government and healthcare providers, which is the exact opposite of what you want to do during a pandemic. 

these aren't all my complaints, but they're the ones i found frustrating *at the time*, which i think is important. it's possible to complain about a lot of this after-the-fact. but if i'm complaining in the moment about bad policy choices, that means somebody in the pmo should've thought about this.

eta: i'll just say, as every single one of my posts in this thread has been downvoted, it's really too bad that critiquing our government for its obvious failures is somehow beyond the pale in this forum now. we should be critiquing our government when they mess up and congratulating them when they do well. downvoting valid critiques because you're a fan of the current government is just shameful politics.",liberals

this is a fair point for what would happen practicaly; i think it is mostly true that the active pro-life people have a christian background. sadly.
but it's a straw man to say it is a religious based argument. in my experience thats what people say when they've never talked to a competent proponent of the issue or really considered the points. it fits the narrative pro-abortionists have built up about us being crazy.
there is nothing about the pro-life position that requires any necessarily christian teaching. it is very easy for a christian, and harder i guess, for non religious people,... but then that is the classic problem about how to have ethics without god/religion, yet most people still have morals. a christian believes murder is wrong because god made people and loves them etc.. but it's not like most non religious people think murder is fine. same with the other ethical concepts involved in the debate. the debate should not be: \"is killing innocent people morally good\" the debate is: \"is killing an unborn baby killing a person\".

i am religious, and have the religious reasons in my mind. but when i argue pro life i use generally accepted morals and our history mostly, because people have that in common. a lot of the times i need stats about it since people assume things without googling. sometimes i need grade 6 biology, because people don't know what a fetus is, or what an abortion is, and think that babies just disappear peacefully into the force like yoda or something. but i can argue it without religion.

why there is such a high correlation to christians i don't know. when i was 10 they taught us what it was in school, i went \"wow that's terrible\" in my mind and that was how it started. like what was different in other people's minds? i see compassionate people who care about other mass killings, but who are vehemently against pro-life people. even hateful. and even celebrating abortion happily. there are people in our society who watch a video about how hotdogs are made and from that decide to go vegetarian, but why is our general society so offended or surprised to find someone who watched a video of a baby in an abortion and is against it.

i think it's actually awefully suspicious that it's more christians that are active about it. i feel like the average canadian values should make a lot more. there is nothing about the argument that should be *necessarily* christian or anti-christian. i think that should make others worried.",conservatives

lpc - 34% 157
cpc - 29% 113
ndp - 21% 44
bq - (25% in qc) 23
gpc - (6%) 1

liberals win the most seats in 98% of 10k simulations. however only win a majority in 3% of simulations.

the one point of divergence vs other models is that there are very narrow pathways to a majority at the current polling levels. the liberals are favourites to win government by a mile, but their vote is already very efficient. in the last election, the liberals won 75% of the top 20 closest races. over 10k simulations, you would expect that number to be lower. for example, if i had a weighted coin that was more likely to land on heads (1) than tails (0), if i flip said coin 10k times, i may expect the coin to land on heads 5100 times and tails 4900 times. 

similarly over 10k simulations the liberals win about 40% of the top 20 closest races instead of 75% hence the divergence in probability. i know i calculate my swings differently than pj and eric grenier/cbc so that may also explain part of the difference.",liberals

i don't like doing exact counts in an election that is so razor's edge with so many seats swinging every which way with paper thin margins, but i do have a few things i expect to see happen:

1. gpc &lt;2% of the votes cast. the lack of candidates who would normally get 1-4% of the vote in dozens of ridings will hurt a lot. the collapse of the harris-may plan will end the harris-may era of gpc growth.

2. lpc ~ 130-135 seats. they will under-perform. people mostly vote on feeling, not policy, and the dominant feeling right now is *exhaustion.* trudeau is on the wrong side of that feeling. i'm less certain about this, but i've bet a round of coffees at the office on it.

3. ppc ~ 4%. they'll improve, but won't reach the heights some polls have shown. a lot of them will come home to the cpc out of hatred for trudeau. the ppc is a very emotionally driven party movement, and the dominant feelings among its supporters, i think, remain hatred for trudeau followed by apathetic distrust of the political system. not a great combo for getting committed voters to the polls who will stick with the purple ticket.

it’s times like this where we have to look at the big picture and the maturing process. based on all the information we have on trudeau, would you say he is a racist person? has he governed against the best interests of different cultures or ethnic groups? i would say no.

that's because they moved towards the center and picked up cpc/lpc swing voters in the ridings that they needed to, while shedding excess voters in safe ridings to the ppc.

this isn't a 'gotcha' moment that an interest group is against it because you don't like the interests they advocate for.

the buyback is going to cost a ton of taxpayer money for negligible, if any, public benefit. i would expect the cta to lobby against it on that alone.

&gt; conservatives now say they want money to go to root causes instead of more restrictions and buy-backs but when it comes time to pay the piper and vote, they consistently install governments that keep cutting social services till they bleed out.

correct, we in general don't like wasted taxpayer money (even when with some frequency our own parties consistently let us down).  but the bigger problem as i see it is that the 'conservatives' you label here (i'm not sure that's an accurate label in this case, however) are proposing an alternative solution when apparently they 'criticize but don't offer alternatives' constantly. i don't see this as a strong counterargument of yours that an alternative is being proposed that likely would accomplish the stated goal of this buyback more efficiently.

of course, the real reason gun owners shouldn't sell is because this will be repealed, eventually.  much like the gun registry, when the substantial amount of canadians who don't care about this issue passionately one way or another - which is probably most - discover the cost of this, they will support its repeal too.",conservatives

in any case though it's a huge risk. the liberals would have to poison the bill in a way the ndp wouldn't accept it, but enough canadians would accept it to give them a majority. it's tricky business, forcing early elections. you could have a john horgan situation where it hugely benefits the government, or a david peterson (ontario 1990) situation where the government is punished. but better to hold an election now on their terms, than later on the opposition's.

i also never once denied that the liberals broke a promise. they did. and in fact, it was a stupid promise to make without going into more details on their plan to begin with. 

but… i’m not a child who has an emotional reaction to every single decision made by politicians. i actually try to understand what happened and why..

did you see how much the media lost their shit over moderate changes to taxation of private corporations proposed by the lpc? now imagine what they’d be saying if the liberals changed the electoral system to something that no other party supports, and basically ensured that the cpc in their current form don’t win again…

sitting around bitching about the liberals doesn’t do anything. if the ndp seem like they’re in a position to win, i’ll happily vote for them next election. until then, keeping the cpc out of power is more important and i’ll take an imperfect liberal government.

you’re literally just speculating that the liberals broke a promise because they wanted to (when the facts don’t actually support that theory). if they didn’t want to fulfill it, why form a multi-party committee on it at all? why not just ignore the fact that they made the promise at all? whey even make the promise in the first place? polls consistently show that electoral reform is not a significant issue for many in canadian politics.

&gt;electoral reform is not like any other policy. it’s a drastic change, and a simple majority gov’t under fptp is not enough of a mandate to make that change.

while it is a large change i disagree that a majority isn't enough to warrant it. if that's what enough people vote for then that's what they should get. it isn't as though everybody couldn't just go ahead and *not* vote liberal the following election if they didn't like the change and then have it undone accordingly. nothing is set in stone, that's kind of the whole point.",liberals

politics here in quebec is influenced by french politics. people won't admit it but the media coverage of the 2015-2017 terror attack wave in europe was huge. the special coverage for the november 2015 paris terror attacks lasted 3 freaking days. and since these days many people in quebec public think that if they aren't firm enough in establishing their french-canadian values with immigrants, they'll have terror attacks too. some people genuinely believes bill 21 will lead all extremist islamist to go to ontario and therefore never cause trouble to quebec.

also the current caq government absolutely needs its nationalist base to win elections. even if they toned down a bit their nationalism they know they can't succeed if they fully go into \"non-nationalist economically liberal\" mindset. people must remind that back when pq appeared as the most nationalist party (from an identity politics perspective, not from a \"who's the quickest to launch a referendum\" perspective) the polls looked like this (i'll take the last léger poll before pkp resigned as pq leader)

liberals 33 pq 30 caq 22.

what was happening at the time is that since the identity politics focused electorate was with the pq, the most federalist but somewhat right-wing and populist electorate stayed with the liberals out of a risk of referendum should the pq return to power.

how legault managed to break this cycle is that when pq got too soft on identity politics after lisée took over and had problems with his mps, he managed too say \"our previously moderate positions regarding laïcité are now the strongest and we stand by them yesterday, today and tomorrow\". he managed to get the identity politics pq vote, then the moderate liberals realized the threat of separatism was now non-existent and went with the caq.

you know the rest of history, there was a blue wave in 2018 and legault later did his bill 21.

but now, there is a pq leader, paul st-pierre plamondon (pspp) who knows that if legault goes soft enough on nationalism, then he'll be able to bring back his identity politics votes and then have a large group in parliament and position himself to become once again a major quebec party, which would obviously rise the fear of a referendum and then bring the moderate liberals back home and then back to square 1.

so because all of this, even tho legault wants to be more moderate he knows that there's a red line not to cross, and recognizing systemic racism would be a red line for his formerly pq electorate.

here is how things stand in quebec right now. mentalities are slowly changing for sure but the nationalist movement remain strong and is far from being in crisis. also i'll debunk a frequent myth, no, caq isn't unpopular with the youth so bad time plays against them. yes they obviously are not as popular with the youth as with, say, older people, but a plurality of young people vote for the caq according to léger, it's just that older people vote for the caq more massively.  


the fact people think quebec youth massively reject legault is because of what i kindly call the \"reddit bias\". non-quebecers who don't speak french will be often in contact with montrealers who speak english, and probably not with poor or people who have only a highschool diploma. so obviously this will cut you from a large part of quebec youth who live outside of montreal and is not in contact with people like, let's say, political-focused guy in reddit coming from the roc.",liberals

many companies got turned away, and the biggest investment we made to comanufacture a vaccine was cansino, and don't even get me started on that.

the bill also made people who are accused of gun offenses where it's alleged the gun was illegally imported ineligible for bail.  again this is a fairly arbitrary punishment and could be ripe for abuse, as the accused are brought to a bail hearing shortly after they're arrested and likely before investigators would have been able to determine the source of any weapons that were confiscated as evidence.  a defendant's freedom would hinge on whether the prosecutor *felt like* the guns in evidence were domestically sourced or illegally imported.

this bill made absolutely no changes to the charge of illegally importing weapons, it merely punished criminals harder if they, knowingly or not, used an illegally imported weapon in the commission of a crime.  i feel that this is just too arbitrary of a charge and would've been abused, so i agree that voting it down is the correct choice.",liberals

this is something the federal government has a role in accomplishing. currently we spend about $3b per year on affordable housing. by contrast, the primary residence exemption, a handout directed to the homeowners who have most profited from the housing crisis, runs $7b per year. we are spending twice as much rewarding the winners of this crisis than on affordable housing.

we need to massively redirect our priorities from subsidizing homeowners and home-buying, which tends to merely increases prices, to actually constructing more housing (market and non-market). of course, housing takes a long time to build so there is a role for direct relief - renters who can't get an affordable unit should be eligible for rent subsidies.

the liberals unfortunately are focused on throwing more money at homebuyers. while this might feel like it helps first-time buyers, it's more likely to end up inflating prices further and actually padding the pockets of incumbent homeowners. the ndp unfortunately supports some homebuyer subsidies as well, but they actually offer some real solutions too. the rent subsidy promises direct relief to people struggling with rent while a promise to build 500,000 affordable homes will provide longer-term improvements and give canada's an affordable housing sector in line with other first-world nations.",liberals

* he failed to pass comprehensive and universal healthcare, instead opting for a system where everyone's required to have ineffectual healthcare that barely covers anything
* engaged in numerous military flukes over the course of his presidency, including destabilization of libya and numerous drone strikes against civilian targets
* insulted the people of flint by drinking water at a press conference to \"prove it was safe\" (to this day, flint still does not have clean reliable drinking water)
* fought against dapl protesters in north dakota who were trying to protect their water sheds against damage from oil production in the state
* oversaw the lackluster withdrawal from iraq which left behind billions of dollars in weapons, infrastructure and vehicles that were later appropriated and used by isis
* perpetuated and oftentimes accelerated the economic conditions that ultimately led to the trump presidency that everyone hated so much

genuinely ambitious people who have had dreams of becoming a supreme court judge have had years to learn french.  regardless of the poor state of second language learning in canada in our schools (which should be reformed, for sure), it's the responsibility of anyone who aspires to a job to ensure that they do all the work to meet the requirements. people with the linguistic intelligence to deal with legalese can certainly learn french if they put themselves to it. it's hard to feel sorry for people who self-select out of hiring processes due to not bothering to learn. 

&gt;instead of a first nations jurist, they went with the white person who'd had the opportunity to learn it.

had the trudeau government made it a priority, he could have found a bilingual or trilingual indigenous judge. there's first nations in québec and métis in the west who could have filled that position. 


&gt;they are also far more likely to non-immigrants, as young immigrants are already learning a second or third language in english.

plenty of immigrants from african and middle-eastern countries speak french. they make the overwhelming majority of immigration into acadian communities, and are the demographic force boosting minority francophone communities elsewhere in the country. it's only going to accelerate as french african populations are predicted to massively grow worldwide. our already multi-racial communities will diversify even more and grow in numbers.

no, francophones would see english-only institutions as illegitimate and unfit to render judgements on anything pertaining to francophone individuals or communities. either they are bilingual or unilingual folks should be asked to recuse themselves on these jugements. we demand that what is asked of francophone judges also be asked of anglophone judges.  we deserve no less in our institutions than what has been afforded to anglophones.",liberals

in political science terms, there's this concept of democratic legitimacy. a body that is democratically constituted has this kind of legitimacy, which gives it a kind of moral right to act. historically, the senate has very rarely tried to impose itself on the legislative process, seeing its role not as an initiator, but as a chamber of sober second thought, where legislation is reviewed, amendments proposed but very rarely in a way that puts it into open opposition to the \"peoples' house\"; the house of commons.

the results of an elected senate can sometimes be almost catastrophic. the 1975 australian constitutional crisis arose directly from conflict between the lower house (the house of representatives) and the senate. the government gained passage of a budget in the lower house, but it got stalled in the senate, leading to a constitutional crisis, since confidence in the westminster system is something only tested in the lower house, and rejection in the upper house just sort of makes the bill end up in limbo. in the end, the governor general invoked the queen's reserve powers to dismiss the government and install a caretaker ministry, a decision that is still hotly debated by westminster scholars to this day.

an elected senate in canada would at a minimum create a competitor to the house of commons, but without the pressure relief valve of confidence. in effect, if the opposing party to the government had the democratic legitimacy in the senate to stall or outright veto legislation, we'd enter the kind of gridlock we see in the us. and really, the authors of the bna act foresaw that even an appointed senate might try that kind of a stunt, which is why they put section 26 in to allow the governor general to appoint additional senators. the only time section 26 has been invoked was by mulroney, when the liberals in the senate were using every instrument at their disposal to delay passage of the act enabling the gst. it allowed mulroney to appoint additional senators to break the tie.",liberals

additionally would you consider disqualifying indigenous persons from donating? as their population is also disproportionally effected by hiv. around 16x if i'm looking at the numbers correct? so where do we define a cut of of order of magnitude to be acceptable?

also as another user asked *\"we haven't quantified the increased hiv risk of msm who claim to be monogamous. sure, you can make broad population claims about sexual partners and cheating, but how does that actually translate into hiv risk? you say you want to use statistics, but then there's no clear quantified link between \"msm cheat and we can't trust what your partner says\" and \"msm who say they're monogamous are an unacceptable hiv risk.\" you've established directionality, but the magnitude doesn't follow without more data. why are false answers to this question in particular more dangerous or more prevalent than false answers to other questions (e.g. iv drug use?)\"*

i'd also like to point out that per the article in question 
&gt; for years advocates have called for the blood ban to be replaced by a gender-neutral screening process that would be based on sexual behaviour and not orientation.as has been the case for some time, every blood donation in canada is tested for hiv. under current testing capabilities, hiv can be detected in a “window period” of approximately nine days after infection, and advocates have suggested updated lifestyle-focused screening questions and eligibility would be determined based on that, rather than outright eliminating certain lgbtq2s+ donors who are sexually active. 

as the article mentions and others have pointed out, lifestyle is more important than self declared sexual orientation, regardless it is self screening to some degree, why not impose the same restrictions on everyone if safety is paramount. you're talking about risks as though the numbers are intrinsically recognizable, you're arbitrarily drawing a line 

&gt; exchanging risk for validation

so this is where you lost me and it transitioned form a discussion about the risk analysis undertaken from blood donors to homophobia. this isn't about 'validation' its telling that you think the people being discriminated against are doing this for some sort of personal validation, i'm guessing you would have argued the same thing when there was a 5 year ban too. 

&gt; ever read the krever report? i have. that's some heartbreaking stuff. we do not need to repeat that. a safe and adequate blood supply is more important than offering validation to a sexual minority.

now this just gets straight up discussing dude and if there were any lingering questions about your biases regarding the gay community you've done plenty to remove any doubt. i have read the report and the fact that you'd align that with somehow the result of gay men giving blood rather than gross negligence at the hands of the canadian red cross is abhorrent.",liberals

why are we putting in treatment plants in the middle of no where for communities of 100 people? people around the world in such a situation use wells and on site treatment (like boiling). basically just setting money on fire to fill this utterly meaningless promise.

https://www.watertoday.ca/map-graphic.asp (look, hundreds of boil advisories no one cares about because they are non-native)

edit: oh and canada has put $3.5bn into this ($2bn in 2015, $1.5bn in 2020). for 100 communities generally under 100 people impacted (~10k people).

at this price tag (**~$350,000/person**), we could afford to rehouse the entire impacted population in toronto and pay their water bills rather than build treatment plants where they don't make sense.",liberals

the answer as to why? canada is a very conservative country. people tend not to think this due to our neighbor in the south, but canadians are more similar to their american counterparts than they are different. canada, not unlike the us, has a history of anti-communism and red scare that has severely impacted left wing movements in this country",liberals

well if you create legal distinctions where no real difference exists, and then incrementally ban your newly created class of firearm, you can stretch the process out over decades, and each election you can incentivize voters by saying you are making them safer by banning the newly created category.

testing is also a nonsense non-solution. it would only be viable for a limited set of mandates. your job can get you tested daily—but places you shop? public spaces you're in crowds with? those can test vaccine status with a passport system easily. they have no way to ensure compliance with a testing regimen. and considering the dangerous morons who don't want a vaccine are often the same dangerous morons who don't believe in covid, self-reported testing is equally a non-starter.

just a side note... is more border security really a top of mind issue for canadians? i have never heard someone from any of the parties mention that one here in ontario. i have never even heard that we had a border security problem? i gotta say though, i really don't want our border turned into the us-mexico border, highly militarized and heavily politicized, and i don't want a fucking wall, this isn't 1500bc china lmfao.",conservatives

i don't see it happening here, at least of the federal level for a variety of reasons.  they haven't seem open to them as they are turning this into an equity and human rights issue.  we just can't get anything done if we insist on making everything fair and looking through at it through a social justice lens.",liberals

in truth he is borrowing money for short term political expediency for benefits canada likely can’t afford.

[this is the only source i could find on this, so take it would a brain assault. ](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/sfr/single-family-rental-housing-tenant-king) it appears that data just came from this property management company that manages 2700 properties, so a fairly big pool but could definitely be skewed.  
  
i agree that rent control shouldn’t be removed; and i never said it should. but it could definitely be adjusted. the way it is now essentially favours short term tenants for one. a long term tenant sounds great, until you’re in my uncles position with a 20 year tenant where his rent by 2020 was probably 1/2 to 1/3 of the value. because of rent control he was basically forced to sell the house because it financially made no sense to keep it, but he couldn’t evict the tenant because they would never want to leave as they would have to pay at least double their current rent for the same size house. so because of rent control he was basically forced to sell the property.  
  
&gt;eliminating all rent control  
  
again, i never called for this or anything remotely close to this, that would be stupid. i’m just saying that rent control really doesn’t benefit most tenants that much. i would say that it probably only starts noticeably helping people who stay for 5 years or more.",liberals
