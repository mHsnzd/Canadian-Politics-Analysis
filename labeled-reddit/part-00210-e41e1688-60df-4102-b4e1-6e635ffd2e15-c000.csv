3 we absolutely know what power it offers kenney. pretty much zero. 

4 yes, the west has been treated like shit since day one and has frequently been specifically targeted by policy many times, and it's population deliberately repressed right up until after world war 1. but that only suggests the western provinces should sit down and start talking - this referendum gets nobody anywhere.

if your holdings are physically being devalued by being uninvested and there are investment opertunities where you can put that money to use while also taking out a loan for less than the loan is worth (i.e. the bank basicially pays you to take out the loan), it provides a heck of an incentive to purchase a house, thats whats really happening.

after this year's (expected) fall election, the liberals will very likely be a majority government again, they are going to have to come up with a bold economic plan and with that we could see something big. a national childcare plan seems to be in the cards which most should consider to be a big ticket item like the above things you've mentioned.

for something the cmhc did? sure, unless he specifically states he's deliberately intervening or something. there's lots of spending and things that went on when justin took over that he's not to \"blame\" for. 

things dont happen right away. i defended trudeau for example when people were screaming 6 months after he got elected that dope was still illegal. it takes time to make those changes, it's not like you can get your head around the whole issue and have an actual plan ready to go in a few months. it takes a lot of time and input from other agencies and you don't have access to that till you're elected. 

so did i blame him that dope was still illegal 9 months after he got in? was it his policy that was getting people arrested. no. and he campaigned on that promise. 

and again -at the time it wasn't an unreasonable policy to try. the libs felt that it was one way to help alleviate the housing affordability bubble. they were wrong and it didn't work but it was worth considering, the idea that it made the housing bubble worse is just pure nonsense.

the point is that, laws restricting how muslim women are allowed to dress are popular in quebec. quebec politicians know this and toe the line. no matter which party you get to power in quebec, there will be laws being enacted that will chip away at freedoms of muslim women who refuse to abandon their faith. some parties walk slowly in that direction while others take long strides, but they are all (well, those who have more than a snowball's chance in hell to form a government are all) going in the same direction.

by the way, it is astonishing how anti-muslim quebec's politics had gotten by 2017 and how it changed (albeit temporarily) in the aftermath of the quebec city mosque shooting. if you have time and you know french, watch this cbc/radio-canada documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6ik7u5sv8

information about bill 62 by the liberal government:

&gt; [if you are wearing niqab] you can walk into a public library, but you can't take out a book.

&gt; you can sit in a hospital waiting room, but you can't interact with staff.

&gt; you can drop off your children at public daycare, but you can't pick them up.
