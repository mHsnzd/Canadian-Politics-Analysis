there’re a lot of analogues between hiv and the msm population and other diseases endemic to specific groups. once something transmissible is released into a relatively insular group the ability to eliminate that diseases relies upon essentially getting this insular group to stop what is causing the transmission.",liberals

the crown is an anchor show, most content on netflix doesn't cost anywhere near that much for them to acquire; and as prime has shown, it's entirely possible to have a service _flooded_ with cheap-to-produce content. *cough*gravitas*cough*.

&gt; you were vague about which were supposed to be “scary foreign content distributors”.

i really don't know who _specifically_ is being referred to when proponents of c-10 refer to large foreign media broadcasters. i've seen netflix, amazon, youtube, facebook and others all used interchangeably as the nefarious foreign powers.

&gt; do you think the goals of c-10 in respect of each is identical?

that's anyone's guess, at this point, because the minister in charge of the portfolio has claimed that large youtube channels may be subject to cancon regulation; and then he waffled and sorta back-tracked. and that important section of c-10 was removed, but we've been assured that it totally doesn't matter, right?

we'll see. no one can say for certain.

&gt; whether or not they attempted to create open platforms like youtube, they do not have them, and therefore your claim that regulating them somehow benefits bell or rogers is demonstrably false.

it's relevant because if the argument _for c-10_ is that the regulation is necessary to support canadian competition, if _no such competition exists_ then we have to question _how c-10 is intended to encourage it to exist_.

so can we expect bell, rogers et al to create competitors to youtube, netflix, facebook, and prime? or is the scope narrower, and we're just trying to ensure that these foreign distributors host canadian content?

again, i'm not really clear, because the minister has waffled considerably.

&gt; and you really think that foreign correspondents and international field offices is proof of…what, exactly?

transnational content creation.

&gt; if cbc news has a foreign correspondent, then cbc doesn’t make canadian news?

that's a good question. when does it stop being the ship of theseus? at what point is it _sufficiently canadian_? when it's owned by a canadian company, regardless of who made it and where? or when it has a canadian actor, regardless of who owns it and where it was made? or what?

[the bank of canada needs to clearly communicate to canadians what's happening with inflation.](https://theline.substack.com/p/ken-boessenkool-and-mike-moffatt)

&gt; let’s return to our two-person, two banana, two-dollar economy, where each person pays one dollar for each banana. now imagine you take away one banana temporarily (say it is stuck on a boat in the port of vancouver). now with only one banana, each person pays one dollar for half a banana or two dollars for one banana. destroying one of the dollars does not solve the core problem, that we have a banana stuck on a boat, and our inflation is only transitory, as it disappears once the banana arrives.
&gt; 
&gt; in short, our standard monetary policy playbook was not designed for these times. treating pent-up or supply-side inflation as demand-pull inflation will result in applying exactly the wrong solution — monetary tightening, rising interest rates. rising interest rates in the face of supply-side inflation could exacerbate the short-term economic harm of these supply-side challenges just as we start to recover. this economic harm will be, to quote the bank of canada governor, transitory, but not short-lived. if some of these supply-side shocks impact our domestic economy (production of automobiles or automobile parts), then the last thing we would want is the bank of canada to harm the economy further by raising rates.
&gt; 
&gt; this puts the bank of canada in a tough spot, as they are required by mandate to keep inflation near two per cent, a mandate that makes no distinction between demand-pull and cost-push inflation. if the bank of canada sticks too closely to that mandate, they risk unnecessarily damaging the economy. however, if they allow inflation to persist, they create an opportunity for opposition politicians to question the independence of the organization.",liberals

&gt;that being said, i'm still more in favour of a system where the parties themselves are forced to disband and candidates are chosen in their local riding without any party affiliation

that sounds great in theory, but if you think about it more, it doesn't work:

1. candidates would have to be knowledgeable in literally everything. when a candidate looks for a party to join, they look for the one where most of their views align and just go along with everything else.
2. it would make it incredibly difficult for constituents to vote. the platforms would be so varied every election that they'd have to read them carefully to see which current candidate goes best with their views, rather than just knowing the platform of the parties. worst case: it turns into even more of a popularity contest.
3. historically, systems that begin this way end up creating caucuses and, eventually, parties. mostly because people will want to band together with others with similar views. you don't even have to go far back in time or to another country to see this: trudeau dissolved the senate liberal caucus in 2014 and every non conservative senator was independent. then in 2019 two caucuses were formed (canadian senators group and, 10 days later, the progressive senate group).

they value the social structure of the community. that is not the same thing. 

lets move on to your quotes :) this is hilarious. 

first giant block you obviously didn't read yourself:

this is in response to my question about where is family mentioned etc.  and in your quote.... he doesnt' mention family except to mention that people need family less as they go on in life. you're a frikkin' genius. :)

and again what he's discussing there is social structure. he's advocating for the 'conservation' of the status quo of the social structure. so all you've done is post a quote that proves my point again. 

second giant block you obviously didn't read

the first quote says we live in communities. well - true but makes no mention of how that's an issue for conservativism. fail. 

second quote says we like cities. doesn't actually say anything about conservative policy. 

third one admits that it wasnt' conservatives who fought for the environment in britian, the politicians did nothing. he claims that it was 'conservative principles' that motivated the people who did fight but in reality we know that's not true. and still today we see that - the people blockading logging aren't conservatives are they. so the conservatives, who are a political party, did not do it. 

&gt;how is that different from classical and neo liberalism. you have failed to answer my question 

i posted an article that explained it in detail. i take it you didn't read that either. sigh - you are living proof that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him think. 

&gt;as i have already proven community, religion, familily, health and tradition are all conservative values.

well first off not really. in fact we know for at least two types of conservativism you propose exist they're expressly not. and you haven't touched on health at all.  

but regardless even if they were that doesn't mean they're exclusively conservative. 

seriously - did you just suggest that anyone who believes in religion must ipso facto be a conservative? do you really need me to explain why that's wrong? 

&gt;yes i would say \"nope\"

so when you suggested they were examples of conservative thinking earlier you were wrong :)

well - you're learning. slowly. 

&gt;litterally you cut off half of my comment

wasn't relevant. i said some people would argue some of those places are poor because of their leftist views. you immediately said that was true while trying to claim i shouldn't \"give you that\". 

don't hate me just because you're an idiot. 

&gt;im being charitable to you, by admitting there are specific times that you are correct.

it's not 'charity' to admit people are correct. and i was 100 percent correct. if i'd said that all impoverished nations were so because of left wing politics then you'd have had a point. but i didn't. 

what a type of person you must be to think that acknowledging that something someone said is 100 percent true is a 'charity'. 

and again - you have failed to make any argument towards your original statements. here they are again: 

there are actual studies that you are looking at which claim we're going to have resource issues globally by 2030. where are those?

which studies are saying that multiculturalism or inclusivity etc are particularly hard on resources? how are you making that argument?

traditional conservatism is absolutely not effective in a changing world. traditional conservatism seeks very slow change and the preservation of the status quo. you yourself have posted references saying that. so - what is your argument in favour of it being the most effective way of addressing changing times?

first of all, while i'm not a career photographer, i do know a few things about photography and cameras. nothing in this image indicates to me that it was staged. a good photographer will end up shooting in bursts (multiple shots at a time) from multiple different angles at various times of the day. they might end up shooting hundreds of images in a single day and they'll only select just a few that are the best. this was probably just the one photo that happened to have the bear facing the camera.

second, it's worth pointing out that adam scotti, the prime minister's photographer, is an incredibly gifted photographer. while trudeau might be fairly photogenic, scotti has a genuine gift for finding stunningly candid moments. you can see some of his work [here](https://www.instagram.com/adamscotti/) and [here](https://cdnadamscotti.medium.com/https-medium-com-adamscotti-2020review-f79cf106104e). i have no doubt he has a fair deal of experience in finding suitable angles, good lighting and the right moments to snap photos.

third, the pmo's photographer almost always accompanies the prime minister on trips. every single prime minister since trudeau sr. has employed a *full-time* photographer to document their time in office. you would think warren kinsella, who was a media advisor to pm chretien, would know this. and yes, that includes accompanying the pm on the more sombre trips as well. [here's stephen harper for instance being photographed by his official photographer paying respects to the tomb of the unknown warrior at westminster abbey](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pmharper/9022721995/).

the economy was in relatively decent shape, not booming, but solid. but that wasn't good enough compared to the party going on in booming alberta and they were voted out in 2007.

the saskparty was voted in, which were the dregs of the old pc party and the remaining token liberals. they threw open the oil development floodgates, cut royalties, and with the high price of oil, money rolled in. they cut taxes and spent like drunken sailors. people were actually moving into the province and housing prices were booming along with the overheated economy. they signed onto the new west partnership agreement with manitoba, alberta and bc. times were great. shady land deals by well connected tories were also back with the still largely empty transportation hub.

and then oil tanked. deficits came roaring back as did program cuts. and it was all ottawa's fault. 

i moved to manitoba three years ago as my old business group was dissolved. head office decided they could serve the saskatchewan market from calgary, edmonton and winnipeg. a lot of other companies decided the same. without the old local content rules, there was just no incentive to keep any more than a token presence in saskatchewan.

i was just reading on some other subreddit that food security in north america is going to become questionable by the 2030s. at 2deg temp shift outdoor agriculture will become impractical in large areas of na (would use to much water as the evaporation rate would dry soil out too fast.)
if its questionable that rich nations will be able to feed themselves, wtf do we think is going to happen to the not so rich....

i like steak, burgers, and bacon just as much as the next guy... but if it has to be more of an annual treat, then so be it, i can live with that (at-least until vat grown meat hits the market en-mass).",liberals

all of this is interconnected, and it all ties back to the capitalist system. when one billionare controls 70% (pulled that number out of my ass, but whatever it is) of the canadian food market and can fix the price of basics like bread, anything we do is going to be moot to their whims. if beef is profitable beef is produced. it won't get less profitable with a 100% tax on it, the difference then is that the poor must eat stews which the rich still eat their fillet mignon. capitalism has and will always ignore externalities. shifting the burden for this structural fact onto the individual wage-slaves of capitalism (*regardless* of where they live) is a fools errand that, to reiterate, only hurts low-income individuals. - and yes, the lowest income homeless person in canada is \"better off\" than those in the global south. that doesn't matter if you're starving in either place. capitalism abuses *every single human being (and the environment) who is not a member of the ownership class*.",liberals

the holiday is there with the intent to *mean* something, not solely be a day off. if anyone should recognize that, it should be the pm of canada. can we maybe hold him to a higher standard than nathan the bank teller who took a day off from his shitty non-prestigious low-paying job to chill with his buddies? i mean, we already don't expect him to be educated or have pertinent real-world experience - the least we can do is expect him to have better ethics than the average canadian. but he doesn't seem capable of that, either.",liberals

but yes - this is mostly media manipulation. it used to be \"if it bleeds it leads\". but there's been insufficient bleeding. where as once newspapers were content to publish a handful of stories once a day 6 days a week to be profitable,  they now need people clicking on 'the latest' dozens of times a day, 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  for that - they've got to 'create' news stories and feed them for as long as the cycle holds. 

so now it's \"we fix till they clicks\". alter, dress up, twist, edit, falsify until it's interesting and shocking. there's dozens of examples especially from the states where the story was actually deliberately altered. only the most shocking terms are used.  in fact it was the first nations who told reporters to stop using the term 'mass graves' as it was misleading. 

this was nothing from the start. everyone knew the gravesite was there. the first nations knew about it when the school was decomissioned but didn't ask to come care for it or for the bodies to be returned or anything. now the bodies have been 'discovered' - right where we knew they were all along. bodies of kids who died of natural causes at about the same rate as they would have at the reserves. 

yet somehow we're not outraged in the slighest over the fact that first nations kids were genuinely used for horrific medical experiments in the 40's and 50's in saskatchewan with the full knowlege of the gov't. guess it doesn't have the same 'scale' as it was only a few schools.",liberals

&gt; people aren’t buying these houses to live in, they’re buying them to get a free ticket to earlier retirement.

if that were true, then they'd be empty. but vacancy taxes raised almost no money because it wasn't the case. speculation isn't good for something like homes but fundamentally it exists because there is strong demand and limited supply. if supply met the demand the other nonsense would be much more difficult. if you want to see a market that hit that equilibrium, check out tokyo. homes are not seen as a investment and despite strong demand for people piling into tokyo and one of the reasons is the municipality makes it very easily to build. nimby lobbies are never consulted and can't force a development to stop. the city planners just set general guidelines and evaluate if the developer met them, including earth quake proofing. 

it always circles back to supply and demand. all the shenanigans and boomers with 4 investment properties is because of the shortfall in supply guaranteeing them a profit. you can't have these issues if supply matched demand. if you demand some ridiculous blind bid system, they'll just move into the new development without that. shenanigans only possible because demand is high and supply is low.

&gt;i am not at all sympathetic to arguments that voters were deceived. if they made assumptions about who they were voting for, that is their misfortune. they can suffer.

why is it a worse outcome to expel this mp? you act like it's some affront to democracy to expel mps, but the power exists for a reason.

if he had been convicted of this crime - or committed it in the run up to the election but was only charged a day or two before - would your opinion change? i can see an argument about severity, but you seem to be trying to make a categorical argument, which is kind of ridiculous.

i'd much rather live in a world where people are honest running for parliament because they know they can be expelled, rather than a world where people try to hide their past to sneak into a guaranteed 4 years of cushy salary as an independent.",liberals
