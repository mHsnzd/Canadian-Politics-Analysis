he was.   he asked the party to return it while simultaneously trying to smear the party as being just as guilty as he was and insisting that they only wanted to get rid of him because he's a \"true conservative\".

the electorate has spoken, and the mandate has been given. in a time of economic uncertainty in the middle of a pandemic.

maybe not the outcome trudeau wanted, but a mandate he deserves, with a level of power the people wanted him to have.

sure, let's say i'm an ideologue. that's not really a rebuttal to what i've said, though... i don't really take it as an insult, either.

&gt;leftism isn't a thing.

it's as much a thing as liberalism, conservativism, and so on are... you're being insanely reductionist here.

&gt;that's why talking in such generalities is useless.

there's no \"generalities\" here. i'm being very precise: leftism is generally an acknowledgement that capitalism doesn't really work and needs a replacement, or if you're more open minded, that capitalism must be *strongly* regulated. if you're open to the latter, that still doesn't make the liberal party leftist, but you could argue it'd make the ndp leftist, depending on their platform/leader at that given time. make sense?

&gt;you write \"socialism\" as a different economic system as if it is antithetical to capital, but this is not the case.

i mean, the definition of a socialist state is one that's a transitionary state to a communist one, which is to say, the end of capitalism.

&gt;in your world the only \"left party\" in canada is the communist party.

you misunderstand me. the only *leftist* party in canada is the communist party (which is wholly irrelevant, as i mentioned). i vote for the ndp, which is a left of center party.

&gt;and that is counter productive to building a true movement to see a better world.

it's not counter productive at all. if you didn't notice, i specifically mentioned i've consistently voted ndp. they're the ones that most closely align to my values, but they aren't *leftist*, and that in itself is fine. if they were further left, they'd presumably become less popular, unfortunately for me.

you shouldn't take this as me criticizing the ndp, i'm simply being precise in my language because i think making *everyone* to the left of the center a leftist is dangerous because it obfuscates and confuses ordinary people. it's this kind of thinking that makes people say that trudeau is a communist when he's the furthest damn thing.",liberals

i agree with you that the pc-equivalent party would likely still be official opposition most of the time in the near term, but the breakup of the right would allow room for the ndp to grow i think because it would eliminate the threat of a cpc majority government won with a minority of the votes and thus dramatically lessen the severity of the need for strategic voting among many on the left. how many more people might start voting for the ndp over time if they knew that a conservative majority government that caters to the far right wasn't a possibility?

a breakup of the right wing would also more likely push us towards electoral reform over time as well, which would be good for the ndp and also good for just, you know, democratic representation in general and the health of our society.",conservatives

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ottawa-announces-17-billion-to-clean-up-orphan-oil-wells-in-western/

&gt;the oil and gas cleanup should create 5,200 jobs in alberta alone and both measures should create 10,000 jobs across the country, mr. trudeau said.

&gt;the $2.4-billion falls far short of the $20-billion to $30-billion demanded by alberta",liberals

the problem with anti-semitism on the left is that it's very obviously not anti-semitism to criticize a country for the bad things it does.

(not to mention the issue of focus.  if you had a relative who was always forwarding you news clips about violent crimes and light sentences and you noticed that 95% of what he sent you was \"coincidentally\" about black men committing crimes and he was oddly silent about white men committing crimes... it's rather obvious he's got some issues with race even though it's obviously not racist to say that violent crime is bad.",conservatives

people who think there is a top-down solution to this are as deluded as the people who still think the us election was rigged.

the sobering reality is that our society is fracturing into two camps, and the break isn’t even a legitimate one between how much government should tax and spend.  it is splitting into those who accept reality and those who live in a fantasy world.  i don’t like to put things so starkly and one sided, but it is true.

this is a perceived and real difference between the cpc and lpc that i'm not sure many in the cpc are willing to accept.

when push comes to shove. even when lpc members have voiced socially conservative views personally, have almost always gone with this way. 

chretien was another example of this with gay rights. the courts told him his rules were unconstitutional. he didn't agree personally with the courts on it. he didn't agree with the majority on it (he was catholic and it was against his personal beliefs). 

but instead of throwing a fit. he honoured the will of the people and the courts and passed the legislation anyways. 

when cpc have had issues where they do not have the will of the people, nor the courts... they have legitimately tried to throw a fit, or threaten to change the law in their favour. that is not exactly what people call \"freedom\". 

remember vic toews saying \"you're either with us or you're with the pedophiles?\" when trying to pass sweeping overreach of government? that had zero support publicly? all while he was banging his under-aged baby sitter?

there was  fascinating discussion over in /r/science, just 14 days ago, which discussed a paper on this topic:

&gt; supporters of a political party change their policy views “immediately and substantially” after that party switches its position on an issue, a sign that political elites could be shaping the opinions of voters. findings call into question whether democracies genuinely represent the views of voters.

that isn't a topic where i'm widely read, but it does accord with my casual observations of how friends' &amp; family members' views have changed to reflect those of their party rather than the other way around. it seems to me, more and more, that we live in an age where cultural identity &amp; politics seems to shape individual views more than that of personal self-interest. perhaps it's that we truly live in an \"influencer\" culture where the views and values expressed by those at the top control the aggregate of individuals more than we wish to believe. if that's the case, then we really need to push those at the top of the political pyramid toward responsible action for the sake of their constituents.",conservatives

so your inference that not \"invest\\[ing\\] in a massive new pipeline project\"  will help to \"wean yourself off oil\" doesn't make sense.  the ex analogy doesn't work here, the better analogy is drug addiction.  

kxl may be a bad investment for this reason, so be it.  that is transcan's problem, not the government's (or is shouldn't be the government's - i do not support gov investment in pipelines).  

the goal is to decrease the amount oil getting burnt. therefore we have to decrease demand.  the best way to do that is by increasing price (ie a carbon tax) and investing the money raised in alternatives to oil.

he sounds like he's putting on a show and i think most people, subconsciously or not, react negatively to that.

i'm interested on how you make a distinction between tfws and snowbirds that is based on more than just having sympathy for one group and not the other.

snowbirds are people who choose to travel to another country for personal reasons and are following all rules of entry when they do so.  and... so are tfws.   they're not fleeing war, famine or persecution.  they're not refugees.   temporary foreign workers are simply people who choose to travel to another country for personal reasons and are following all the rules of entry when they do so and they're no different than snowbirds.   (and in both cases the receiving country was just fine with letting them in and gets an economic benefit from them.)

yes, i get why you'd have more sympathy for one group than the other because i share those sympathies for the same reasons.   the fact remains, \"i have sympathy for you\" isn't a particularly good reason as it's not based on any particular principle beyond personal sentiment.

and it's worth noting that that distinction between sympathetic and not sympathetic is exactly the reasoning behind mr. o'toole's demand that law abiding canadians be vaccinated ahead of criminals.   

&gt; i get it, it's nice for the privileged few who can afford to jet off to a gated community in florida to get their vaccine. 

yes, we're on the same page here.   i don't find people who travel abroad right now particularly sympathetic.  quite the opposite.   but if we're just going off who we find sympathetic, we don't have much of a leg to stand on.     and it bears repeating: the sympathetic vs. not sympathetic was erin o'toole's reasoning.",conservatives

first, it's a bad piece of rhetoric; the idea that the \"left\" has \"owned\" canada is difficult to defend without resorting to propaganda. canada wobbles a bit around a moderate centre, and as much as i'd like to tip that towards more social democratic ideas, that's not where we are. it has the sound of creating a false enemy, a tactic that has some dubious precendents.

second, i much prefer the idea of a country where we have a dialog, and \"take canada back\" sounds much more like a portrayal of a zero sum game, and one where only one group gets their way.

no, the point being advanced here is that \"nazi\" values do not align with cpc values, and ancom values do not align with ndp values, just because those extremists support these mainstream parties. 

their values are vastly different from the parties they support, but the values of the party they support are the most tolerable for them compared to the other parties. 

a white nationalist might, for instance, want to end non-white immigration to canada altogether because they don't want more non-white people in canada.

faced with the choice of the cpc maintaining canada's already high immigration levels, or the lpc further increasing the amount of immigrants to canada, they might choose the cpc because it's relatively less undesirable in their eyes. even though it's obviously still quite undesirable to them and not remotely close to what they want. 

if someone gave me the option of having an arm cut off or having a fingernail removed i would choose the fingernail, that doesn't mean i want to get a fingernail removed. 

&gt; the implication is that nazism is just another political alignment like any other.

it is. 

&gt;  there's a reason you can walk into a room and call yourself a communist and be fine, but couldn't do the same as a nazi.

because one ideology is less tolerated than the other in a given time and place(western countries in 2021). 

if you lived in the 1950s and said \"homosexuality should be a crime\" it would fly. if you said \"i'm a communist\" that wouldn't fly. 

&gt; it's not an opinion that \"communism isn't as bad as nazism\".

politically speaking, the lack of support for the energy sector in alberta isn't surprising in the least for two reasons.  firstly, he can build 15 pipelines for alberta and still win 0 seats there.  secondly, it's not like the slow death of the oil industry is news and there's not a whole lot that anyone can do about it.  the market has been moving against that sector for a while and looks like it will continue to do so.

but anyway, i feel like she’s fundamentally misunderstanding the issue here. what is a fringe of canadian society at large appears to be a significant chunk of the conservative base. i know she’d rather not hear it, but when poll after poll puts 40% of conservative voters on the other side of any issue, o’toole has a big problem on his hands.

anecdotally, these same people are enthusiastic, free with their time and money, and organize like hell. the strength of the socons, who seem attacked by sloan’s removal, is greater than their numbers. 

further, this far-right represents some of the safest seats for the conservatives. having gone down this rabbit hole together, the cpc jettisoned almost all the old pc brand and membership, and they’re now a third party in major cities and even provinces. 

so while she’s right he needs to put these people in their place, i can’t but feel they have the leverage over the party, not the other way around.",conservatives

well said, 40% is not a fringe even by the most generous interpretation of that term.  the percentage of trump supporters is probably even higher among the most agitated conservative party members, i.e. the people who share emails, go canvassing, and donate money.

&gt;for instance he has a bad habit of conflating, capitalism, imperialisms and neoliberalism as being synonymous with one another.

false. provide an example.

&gt;that's not really logical at all. if were logical, it would already have occurred. 

you're not making any sense, or you're intentionally misreading me.

&gt;likewise, you're misrepresenting the proliferation treaty by ignoring that it's designed to limit/stop the spread of nuclear arms proliferation to npt countries, not end it in it's entirety (at least not legally speaking).

i quoted from the treaty itself; you are clearly incorrect in stating that the treaty does not hold states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. 

&gt;hypothetical speculation is not a logical retort to the evidence. fear that something will happen is not a guaranteed assurance.

i pointed out that we have come very close already, and am pointing out the undeniable fact that the longer nuclear weapons exist, the more likely we are to confront nuclear war. to put this in words you might be able to understand, if there were no nuclear arms, there would be no chance of nuclear war.

&gt;particularly when the evidence shows that nuclear war is increasingly unlikely. particularly to the extent you're alluding it to be.

readers can familiarise themselves with the doomsday clock (managed be the bulletin of the atomic scientists), and why the organisation has moved its clock only 100 seconds from midnight: \"in the nuclear realm, national leaders have ended or undermined several major arms control treaties and negotiations during the last year, creating an environment conducive to a renewed nuclear arms race, to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to lowered barriers to nuclear war. political conflicts regarding nuclear programs in iran and north korea remain unresolved and are, if anything, worsening. us-russia cooperation on arms control and disarmament is all but nonexistent.\"

&gt;that evidence tends to invalidate the actually likelihood of nuclear war happening though since the involved parties in each case did everything in their power during those situations to prevent that from happening. the odds also become increasingly unlikely in a post-cold war/post arms race environment.

your view is comically out of touch with expert opinion. again, look at the doomsday clock. listen to the un arms research chief who recently stated that risk of nuclear war is the highest it has been since wwii. this is widely acknowledged by experts in the field.",liberals

gmy2ap8,2021-02-10T23:21:16.000-08:00,"opinion: trudeau’s government could learn lessons from the chrétien era when it comes to economic policy – and performance &gt; for example, as noted in our new fraser institute study, the chrétien government famously balanced the federal budget in 1997-98, largely due to spending cuts that saw federal spending (excluding interest costs) reduced by 9.7 per cent over two years.

&gt; once the budget was balanced, the chrétien government imposed discipline, requiring at least a balanced budget each year, leading to a long string of surplus budgets that reduced the national debt. the balanced budget also allowed for important tax cuts, which made the country more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs, investors, business owners and professionals.

the thing about budgets is they don’t exist in a vacuum. if the government has a budget surplus then someone has a budget deficit. in this case it was the lower and middle classes. you can only draw from that well so many times. what’s the value in passing a surplus this year? are we just supposed to leave consumers holding the bag on this crisis? that sounds like a great idea that will spur business and economic growth. a lot of our issues today are chretien’s policies finally coming home to roost: short term gains at the expense of long term prosperity.

but, chretien and trudeau are facing different economies. the boomers are well into their retirement years now and not in their peak earning years as they were in the 1990s. this also goes a long way to explain the decline in labour participation rates. 

automation is increasing at an increasing rate, so fewer workers are needed in manufacturing for instance than were needed in 1996 for the same amount of output. 

chretien was faced with stable oil prices for his entire tenure. oil has tanked, and only somewhat recovered for trudeau. from that perspective it would be no more fair to compare kenny to klein for economic performance. 

high student debt and extremely high real estate are crippling younger folks, who aren't able to offset the retiring of the boomers. most of this is the purview of the provinces.

pearson may have pivoted canada away from england after the suez canal crisis, but he supported biculturalism and pivoted our focus towards the united states. pearson never envisioned us to become a multicultural globalist society, it is a by product of pierre trudeau's attempt at neutralising anglo-franco tensions but the consequence is the destruction of canada's historic identity.

of course, most canadian voters don't seem to care about this, but in the next 10 years when canada starts to no longer recognise its historical identity, people will start to notice and it'll already be too late by then. people only notice such things and recognise how it affects their lives when it becomes blatantly obvious to the point where it is no longer ignorable. if canadians can't *grasp* this now then it deserves what is coming.",liberals

hdoir9v,2021-09-20T14:14:12.000-07:00,"cbc projects liberal victory great point, see yves-francois blanchet vs mario beaulieu (who?), exhibit a.

generally speaking, quebec has always voted with the party they believe best represents quebec’s interest within the confederation. in the roc, the interests are often grouped for the whole country, making it hard for a voter to broadly agree with a party platform.

this is also why the cpc is a lying and untrustworthy party. they cannot reasonably represent the majority of their voter base. it’s much more honest to have more parties and vote for the one you actually align with. 

unfortunately, customs in canada prevent us from doing so and we default to liberal rule, which is far from being the worst thing. it’s half status quo and half progressive (i’ll say it went way more progressive during the pandemic). the danger with liberal rule (and even moreso with cpc) is a majority. you need the minority to keep it honest. but, canadians will agree in a more important number with liberal policy making rather than other parties. 

i love me some minority government.

of all the whining about the election being useless, 2019 election did not have a single mention of covid. this was a good call to ensure that the government was going in the right direction for its people. of all my liberal bashing years, i actually agree with this election call. their mandate wasn’t covid, they had a strong response, and they asked the public to validate that response.

to call an election at this time to gain more seats when it wasn't needed is a power grab no matter how you look at it. and he did so at considerable health and monetary cost to canadians.

hdokyzj,2021-09-20T14:36:59.000-07:00,"cbc projects liberal victory i'd say it's not as much a loss for the lpc as it is a loss for trudeau. any way you sliced it tonight going by the past couple months of polling, the liberals still were going to be the top dogs in parliament. the absolute worst case scenario for them was the cpc winning slightly more seats, which in all likelihood would mean the ndp or bloc prop a liberal government up in return for various concessions etc.  with 145-155 seats, they're basically where they were after 2019, which means they still get to govern as an effective majority by coasting off of 15-25 or so bloc &amp; ndp votes to basically pass what ever initiative they would have passed if they had won a majority.

what this does show however, is that trudeau is bleeding votes for the liberals each election by winning weaker and weaker minorities. yes he's basically the best of bad options, but that's a card that gets less reliable the more times you play it. if the cpc modernize more on social and climate issues by the next election and their socon/populist baggage flocks over to the ppc, the liberals will most definitely need new leadership to survive the next election. what's kept the liberals position secure in 2019 as well as during this election has largely been the reform/paleoconservative elements of the cpc making moderates and potential swing voters scared of voting for them en masse. that's generally done more to keep trudeau in power than his own popularity.",liberals

but that is very different from saying that a vote for a losing party in fptp has no effect and cannot be useful. 

as your comment suggests, one of the first things a voter looks at when choosing what party to support is how well that party is doing in the polls or has done in the past - the credibility of its campaign to win the seat or form government. this, in turn, is based on how many votes it has previously received. so, every time you vote for a party and increase its vote total you are improving its credibility in the eyes of other voters. the greens are forever trying to remind people of this, and its a big part of the story of their slow build from less than 0.1% of the vote to winning up to 6.8% and now holding seats federally and in several provinces. 

in addition to slow builds, your vote for a third party can help to form a \"bedrock\" of support can help position a party to appear as a credible alternative during major realignment elections where one party collapses and its supporters are looking for alternatives. 

basically, humans are pack animals. we don't like feeling like we're alone in our views, and there are strong identity conformist pressures on voters that we often don't acknowledge. people are more likely to feel comfortable supporting a party if they feel like its not something that would mark them as being completely outside their peer group. 

voting for a third party can also be useful in influencing a winning party's platform and priorities going forward, although this is a much trickier strategy to effectively navigate. the idea is that a party like the liberals is always on the lookout for voters it can bring into the fold or parties coming up on their flanks. if they see that they're losing a bunch of votes to the ndp or greens, they may introduce policies that appeal to those voters to win them back. voting for a third party shows that you are part of a group of *engaged* voters whose votes may be won by the right combination of policies. this becomes tricky because you can sometimes also contribute to issue ghettos and oppositional reactions from mainstream parties if they come to see supporters of a particular cause as unwinnable. 

so, when we talk about \"strategic voting,\" my hope is that we can talk about more than the most commonly discussed strategy of \"prevent party x from winning this one election\" and discuss other strategies people might consider, like \"contribute to the growth of party y over time\", \"help show broad support for policies 1, 2 and 3,\" or \"contribute to the perception that party z has broad support, to help them in minority government negotiations.\"",liberals

the same can be said for toronto centre. if she picked a different riding and left toronto centre it would be unlikely any other candidate could get over 10% there. the greens would be giving up their support in toronto centre after spending tons of resources building it up in the fall. do i think she could win? it’s certainly hard to see with it being so strongly liberal but she has surprised me before. it’s high risk but could also bring high rewards because if she does well in toronto centre it could spill into other nearby ridings. the greens need a new strong regional base to go after as vancouver island and the few seats in atlantic canada can only go so far. being competitive in toronto could be a game-changer for the greens.

\\-- committed by a person who is in a position of trust or statutory authority in respect of children or young persons;

\\- conduct that poses a heightened risk to a community’s efforts to address consumption of controlled substances in accordance with its own community approaches. this concern is often present in relation to isolated or remote communities;

\\- conduct where there is a factually grounded basis to associate it with another offence contrary to the cdsa, including cultivation, production, harvesting, trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking, obtaining a prescription substance for the purpose of trafficking or the use of others, or importation of a controlled substance (for commercial gain) or another criminal code offence;

\\- conduct in breach of the rules of a regulated setting such as a custodial facility, jail or penitentiary;

\\- conduct committed by a peace officer or public officer, where it is relevant to the discharge of their duties.\"

the shifting of manufacturing to cheap labour countries (such as china) has provided cheap consumer goods, but it has also had a lot of negative impacts on canadian (and western) manufacturing and the labour that those former manufacturers used to employ.",liberals

we were an easy target with a leadership willing to comply with the ccp a demands. canadian elites and politicians have been linked to the ccp for decades (here's a great video that goes in depth into the topic https://youtu.be/5tkyg7q4rie). 

we saw it on full display this past year with the can-sino vaccine which we helped develop and now china refuses to distribute any to us. then nearly selling a gold mine to a chinese corporation that has little economic value and was clearly a strategic move to gain hold of the northwest passage. and not to mention the governments insistence to over turn the ruling made by our top general to bar the chinese people's liberation army from conducting training on our soil. and finally denying our prime minister denying a clear cut genocide of a native people of another country. it is insane we've completely lost the plot.

we've become so focused on hating ourselves that we've lost focused on the real evil festering around us. instead of being a country with principles and a beacon of hope, prosperity, and freedom for all people across the globe to come and take part, we've turned into a petulant child who does not realize how good they have it and are dead set on pulling this country back into the grips of authoritarianism.",liberals

consumers demand cheap products. they want cheap food (so we use foreign labour to grow it), they want cheap electronics (from china) and clothes and everything else. everyone is in a race to the bottom to meet that demand.

but that demand only exists because we've seen decades of wealth stagnation throughout the most prosperous era of human history. they sat still as we invented home computing and the internet, the largest productive change since the industrial revolution. meanwhile cost of living has only increased.

that means most canadians can't afford to purchase products with any other principle other than price. they don't get to decide to support local businesses, or buy organic, or any other type of consideration because they don't have the financial leeway to do it.

as long as price is the most important factor in decision because of a lack of disposable income, this problem will only continue to get worse.",liberals

however, it needs to drop the “how is it working for you conservatives of alberta” tone.  this just gets people’s backs up and we really need to focus on just what a failure kenney has been if we want to get rid of him.

imagine being a 40 or 50 something senior energy worker making a healthy six figure salary with at least six weeks of vacation and a benefit package that has benefits most people don’t realize can be benefits.  now, take that all away and be told that, if you ever want to work again, you are going to have to re-train for an entry level it position.

this is the position that thousands...tens of thousands...of albertans found themselves in over the last five years.  notley wasn’t bad, but things weren’t getting better.  here comes kenney promising to bring back your old job...why not take the chance, you don’t have anything to lose.

i worked for nine years in finance in the energy sector back in the aughts.  i was on the natural gas side of things and was stunned when i saw the price collapse once “tight gas”, more commonly understood as shale gas, started hitting the market.  i realized that it was only a matter of time before oil from those shale formations hit the market as well.  when i was laid off, which inevitably is the end result of working an energy sector job, i made a clean break from the industry and have worked in the tech sector since (yes, calgary has a tech sector).

when kenney came peddling his solutions i saw through them.  the problem isn’t that environmentalists have won, but rather that they have lost.  the world is awash in oil and will be for the rest of our lives.  between russia, saudi arabia and us shale oil, there is way too much supply...it was so bad that russia and opec had to enter into supply agreements to try to bring the price up.  those agreements collapsed and, when combined with the pandemic, we briefly saw oil contracts turn negative last may.

more pipeline capacity would help reduce the price differential between wti and wcs, but it isn’t going to bring back many, if any, jobs.  it would help provincial coffers a bit but we aren’t talking boom times here.

singh: over promised, was called out on some values said vs values in action. family stories and personal experiences in a 45 second stint for answers are quite repugnant. it was like watching an add for a tampon that showed you how well you could play sports and right before you try it some lady bleeds through her pants relying on the same thing you haven’t tried yet.

trudeau: evaded questions about why he called the election. when it was obvious that he wanted a majority. showed action which had been in play backing it with facts. was called out on his use of feminist support as a marketing ploy and sited for getting rid of strong females he worked with.

paul: does not have a great presence on screen. she needs some guidance or practice with this for sure. had some solid points behind unity that  would have been better delivered if her cadence was improved. called out most oppositional leaders, her facts were on point and her attitude was very professional.


o’toole: all of his points were mute. he was like the wallpaper in a public washroom. sure it’s there but i’m not going to be upset if it wasn’t.

blanchet: can this really just be about quebec? tough question, hmm interestingly he became less able to speak english with the hard questions. some answers he gave we’re really quite decent but it was on a 9% scale out of 100%.

it was incredible to watch them all get kicked in the proverbial nuts within the first line of questioning. like ufc with words only where the players can only speak in the polite canadian professional standard.

trudeau seemed a little too aggressive, though he was on the defence a lot of the time. he got some good lines in but i don’t think he broke through. 

singh did alright, got some good points across as well, specifically on indigenous issues, but overall seemed kind of in the background. was interrupting a ton. 

paul surprised me. she did well, but stumbled on a few points. was a good chance for viewers to get to know her, speak to her campaign. i think she accomplished this.

meanwhile, even in fptp there's no such thing as a \"wasted\" vote. there are serious consequences for every vote cast in terms of future campaigns and party policy calculus. people are more likely to vote for a party that gets more votes. your ndp vote today may lead to others getting on board in four years. likewise, a large voter share going to the ndp may nudge the liberals to introduce more left wing policies to court those voters back.

gl45irc,2021-01-28T00:53:40.000-08:00,"it’s time to abolish the costly, meaningless governor general job there are ways, i suppose, it could work. for instance, in japan and sweden, the sovereigns holds no actual political power. while they do name prime ministers and cabinets, it is purely ceremonial, and it is in fact the parliaments of both nations that decide who the government is. in the event of a hung parliament, the sovereign in both states may serve as a mediator, but has no constitutional role.

i'm not saying that's a route we should go. as we can see from places like israel, having an almost purely ceremonial head of state can lead to prolonged political instability, whereas even in a country like belgium, which has had over the last decade or so, incredible difficulty in forming governing coalitions, having a head of state who actually does have reserve powers capable of naming ministries in the event that parliament is unable to decide the issue, permits continuity in government while the politicians try to sort things out.

for me, the single biggest reason to maintain a non-partisan monarchy, even if the queen is represented by a governor general, is that the sovereign represents a kind of negative power. the reserve powers, seldom to be used, are powers that cannot be invoked by a pm. even the power of dissolution sits in the hands of the vice-regal representative, and the gg (or lieutenant-governor in the provinces) can in fact refuse such a request if they deem it incorrect, or not in keeping with responsible government. that's what happened in 2017 in bc, when we ended up with a hung parliament, and the bc liberals lost the confidence vote on the throne speech. christy clark attempted to advise the lg to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, and the lg, seeing that the ndp could form a stable government with a confidence and supply agreement with the bc greens, denied clark's request, and basically fired the premier and asked john horgan to form a government.

that is the value of  the vice-regal offices, to handle situations like this. having a politician fulfilling that role is to invite accusations of bias. having a supreme court justice fulfill the role in any but a temporary fashion is to risk that separation of powers that is critical to our system of government.",liberals

i appreciate the author's emphasis on the importance of differentiating american and canadian conservatism.

i'd like to see the tories first and foremost act as philosophical conservatives who are more focused on order and tradition and less focused on privatizing stuff and lowering taxes. a cautious approach to change, and a party that strikes the right balance between communitarianism and individualism.

right now canadian governments don't have a big history of using terrorism designations as a political weapon against their domestic political opponents. this is a thing that happens in russia, not canada. just being designated has a whole host of legal ramifications for the named group (and obligations for the security services to action).

it isn't a stretch to imagine a situation where the conservatives are using this process to label left wing groups as terrorists as well when they are in power.

i don't like public security matters to be put in the hands of the rank and file politicians that make up the house of commons. too many opportunities for abuse imo.",conservatives
