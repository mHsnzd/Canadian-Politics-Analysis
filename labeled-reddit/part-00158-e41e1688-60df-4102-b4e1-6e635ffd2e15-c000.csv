though part of the problem with policy is that half of it doesn't happen anyways, and it's a bit of a crapshoot to know which ones will happen. 

then there are totally unexpected polices that are dumb and come out of left field (like this google link tax stuff) and one has to evaluate based on a parties ideological preferences how likely these crazy things are to pop up.

however, i will concede that there are bad faith actors who throw those accusations out there in bad faith to shut down legitimate criticism that really isn't coming from a place of prejudice or privilege. like how ndp stans were calling anyone a racist who criticized singh over this past week's publicity stunt involving the gg. \"your guy wore blackface\" is not a valid response to valid constitutional concerns. it's a knee-jerk meme. (and what of the gg's identity herself? i guess it's not a bad look somehow for singh to be \"talking over\" an indigenous woman? negated somehow by charlie angus' about face from two years back where he started caping for jwr, i suppose...)

what's really worrisome however, is how quite a few people on orange twitter who, when confronted, called the constitution *itself* prima facie racist and therefore invalid, and accused constitutional scholars like emmett macfarlane and philippe lagasse of \"white-man-splaining\" because they didn't just defer to singh as an \"expert\". some have even dismissed simon herself as a \"stooge for colonialism\" (despite singh apparently wanting the monarchy to suppress a democratic election). imho that whole mess gets into some pretty dangerous populist denial-of-reality weeds that don't lead to a good place at all...",liberals

in doing so, they're gumming up the works and making it difficult if not impossible for the liberals to get actual work done in parliament. when something doesn't go their way they obstruct and present symbolic motions \"calling on\" the government to do x, y and z that they're already in the process of working on, or \"condemning\" the government for doing a, b, and c that they're not doing at all. considering your flair, you might appreciate this example: instead of presenting a motion that had anything whatsoever to do with the pandemic, blanchet chose to level a personal attack upon trudeau, demanding that he condemn his own father for actions taken during the october crisis before he was even born. this as angus and poilievre were tag-team vilifying his ailing mother, on the heels of bob fife pushing rupert murdoch gossip with the headline framed as sophie developing covid from getting \"cozy\" with idris elba at a we charity event. it's been nothing but noxious, personal attacks instead of constructive input, on and on and on for almost two years now.

what harper era healthcare policies have the liberals actually reversed though? did they increase the health transfers back up to previous levels? no, they maintained harper's formula. it's easy to say \"the harper decade was terrible\", because it was, but the liberals haven't actually reversed it. they've maintained it and moved on, as they often do following conservative cuts.

and in the end, what does that have to do with pharmacare? there wasn't a fledgling pharmacare plan that was halted by the cpc and is now being restarted. there were promises and studies. and now trudeau has delivered promises and studies.

as with childcare, i think the liberals have it in them to do the right thing, but they always seem to need to be forced to. i'd love to be wrong and see trudeau create an actual plan for pharmacare, but if they win a majority i'll be crossing my fingers for them to even follow through on childcare before the next election rolls around. if they win an election, strong odds we'll hear nothing about pharmacare for years and then suddenly start inching off the ground just months before the election, just like childcare right now.",liberals

décevant pour un ancien député. mais révélateur. 

&gt;pierre nantel avait une bonne équipe qui travaillait fort pour lui (probablement des gens qui le soutenaient avant au npd). et jusqu’à la dernière minute ils ont essayé de gagner même quand tous les sondages étaient contre eux.

pour clarifier, mon idée était qu'il s'agissait d'un sabotage inconscient. faire exprès de perdre au plus profond de lui tout en ne sachant pas que c'est ça qu'il fait dans sa conscience active, pas de se ruiner en ne faisant pas d'efforts de terrain. je l'ai mal expliqué.

quand même. d'ici, je trouvais que son équipe semblait pas mal mince, même si passionnée. pour l'élection de megan mitton dans memramcook-tentramar en 2018, on était rendu à 80 bénévoles pour 11 000 électeurs en se battant contre une équipe libérale habituée pour un député libéral sortant.  nantel en avait 50 pour une population d'électeurs d'environ 8 fois plus grande et avait l'avantage d'être le député sortant. 

mais comme tu étais là sur le terrain et pas moi, je vais me fier à tes observations. si tu penses qu'il avait l'air de se battre jusqu'à la fin, d'accord. l'organisation verte au québec devait être assez minime de base, j'imagine. 

d'après toi, qu'est-ce qui a fait gagner trudel? un mélange de bonne organisation de terrain, bonne candidature et montée générale du bloc?

&gt;may a toujours improvisé par rapport au québec.

oui, c'est vrai qu'elle n'y connait pas grand chose. mais il y avait aussi un problème de longue date avec les verts, une culture où en adoptant une espèce de mentalité de décentralisation carte blanche \"touche pas\", on pensait que les orgs locales allaient spontanément joindre les mains avec les populations locales et se terminer en histoire de bisounours. c'est-à-dire de faire élire des gens sans machine électorale, ni d'analyse approfondie, ni d'enracinement historique. juste en chantant climat climat climat. ce qui est très naïf. 

l'enracinement qui a eu lieu à des endroits clés c'est fait avec 1) l'enracinement de may dans sa circonscription et 2) les percées provinciales. et ces machines provinciale sont beaucoup plus huilées que la fédérale. mais ailleurs, c'était difficile. la structure du parti est très incompétente. 

là on est passé d'un extrême à un autre avec paul. d'un \"faites ce que vous voulez, peu importe\" à un \"faites ce que j'exige de vous\". et la machine est encore incompétente.

but he did stand up for free trade and nafta, privatized petro-canada, fought apartheid and lowered the deficit as a percent of gdp. though at the same time he didn't balance the budget.

*sigh*...mulroney. his legacy is complex. i wasn't alive when he was in power, though personally i place him as average. good economic and foreign policy achievements, but his domestic policy was not so good. like i said, corruption in the airbus affair, not to mention how he pissed off his entire quebec base (introducing charlottetown/meech lake was perhaps the stupidest move of his tenure and he knew it was going to anger quebec nationalists that helped him win that landslide in 1984).

personally, i view mulroney as canada's [malcolm fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malcolm_fraser). for those who don't know malcolm fraser was the pm of australia from 1975-1983. he was a member of the australian liberal party (which is australia's conservative/centre-right party). he ramped up immigration (like mulroney) and ran massive deficits (like mulroney). fraser resigned his liberal party membership in 2010, calling it \"too right-wing\".

he's generally tried to portray himself as closer to the centre, but he's also allowed a lot. look at what the party was like under the majority of harpers tenure, and how rarely some stuff came out. here, we've had votes against climate change at the convention, and half the caucus voting against abortion and voting for conversion therapy in the house. he can say \"i didn't vote for those things\", but he also didn't condemn those votes, and they happened. that's part of how you sort of wink at one wing, while still trying to portray yourself as something else.

he's also not in a position of power. right now, him saying \"i don't support x\" while his entire party does doesn't mean much. if he has the power to actually change something, will he fold? that's a different question.

all that aside, what he's saying isn't exactly great either, it's just less terrible than some others. for example, 
https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5613399 has leaked video of him originally supporting all the arguments they eventually used to vote against the conversion  therapy ban

https://theeyeopener.com/2020/12/erin-otoole-under-fire-for-residential-school-comments-made-to-ryerson-conservatives/
(ignore the source, this one sums it up best but there's about fifty other sources that covered this one so you don't have to trust this publication to trust the story)
this was also not great, where speaking to conservatives he said \"leftys are the dumbest people in the school\", and then proceeded to talk about how residential schools weren't all bad, and the problems with cancel culture. all pretty standard right wing talking points. 

the big thing about both of these is they leaked. yeah, publicly, otoole seems like a step towards a more moderate position. i can agree he hasn't made a lot of terrible statements to press, etc (tho we can debate some of them). but when he's not in front of the cameras, he's at the very least pandering to right wing supporters, and at the worst he's revealing his true colors. that what says a lot to me, and more importantly makes me even more skeptical - if i believed i knew where he stood, and he was right wing, that would be one thing. when he shows though that he portrays himself differently than his values, it makes it hard to ever trust his words on anything. it makes you go \"what else has he said to supporters privately that i just don't know about\"",conservatives

in alberta, the ucp \"cut costs\" by making changes to doctor appointments and how much doctors could charge - which led to doctors sending patients for more tests, which cost money... meaning that there were no savings. however, in true conservative government fashion, this meant more money going to private companies (connected to party members) - so they don't really care about the wasteful government spending.",conservatives

my main point, and the one that gets lost in my rudeness is that there is a very limited number of residency slots in this country (by no means does everyone who applies get one), and they should be first provided to those who graduate from medical school in this country. if there is one residency slot, and there are two candidates - one from canada and one from abroad - what is the rationale in granting preference to the one from abroad? in the end there is only one that gets the slot and becomes a doctor, so i say grant preference to the canadian candidate.

so yes, now we're seeing companies struggle to hire while there's a parallel surge in demand for consumer goods.

but i think we can still blame the government for all this; let's consider this:

there's an argument to be made that the feds haven't been allowing labour-in-canada to compete on even footing with employers; when employers find themselves unable to fill positions at the current market rate they have a tool available to pull in labour from abroad _before attempting to find local labour at a higher compensation_.

and that's where the feds are turning now: canadians are finding themselves able to _refuse abusive employment terms_, which has employers struggling to fill positions at current market rates, and so the grits are proudly announcing how they're going to [expand immigration and tfw programmes](https://www.cicnews.com/2021/12/trudeau-releases-canadas-new-immigration-system-priorities-1219549.html):

&gt; fraser is being asked to work with the employment minister to establish a trusted employer system for canadian companies hiring temporary foreign workers. in addition, he is being asked to improve the global talent stream of the temporary foreign worker program (tfwp) by simplifying work permit renewals, upholding the two-week processing standard, and establishing an employer hotline.

so i think there's plenty of blame to place on the shoulders of the grits. canadians can't _hope_ to demand higher wages when their government responds to labour \"shortages\" by flooding the market with more labour.",liberals

there are green party stances, [such as its opposition to nuclear power](https://www.greenparty.ca/en/media-release/2020-11-10/greens-call-federal-government-abandon-nuclear-and-invest-renewables) that will make serious co2 reductions in canada practically impossible to achieve. 

there are many modest actions that, while not sufficient to combat climate change in one fell swoop, can nonetheless create conditions for a later political coalition to do so. 

for instance, a carbon tax - even one that is low - could encourage the growth of green industries and discourage the growth of fossil fuel production. on the margins, it would shift the balance of political and economic power towards greener jurisdictions. even in fossil-fuel producing areas like alberta, it could create pockets that are less dependent on the oil patch. 

insofar as the green party has impacted canadian politics, it has hurt the likelihood of green policies being implemented by splitting the vote. for instance, in 2008, harper won a plurality with only 37.5% of the vote and held power even as the greens (winning 7% of the vote and zero seats), bloc, ndp and liberals all supported greener policies. 

if we had implemented the green shift in 2008, and a liberal-ndp coalition had guided stimulus spending toward greener enterprises, we'd emerge with a much less fossil fuel dependent economy. subsequent decisions about say, the transmountain pipeline might have looked very different.
