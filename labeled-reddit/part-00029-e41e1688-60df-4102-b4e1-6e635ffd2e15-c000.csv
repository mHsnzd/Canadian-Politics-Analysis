&gt; there hasn't been any study that i've seen that suggests the current ban on men who have sex with men is currently beneficial to the overall supply. 

i crunched the numbers according to data from the uk's nhs recently, and it's a pittance in terms of new donors:

not sure that i'd want to give some kid who needs a transfusion hep c or hiv in order to gain a net 85 donors.

&gt; nations that have dropped the ban have not seen an increase in infections from transfusion products.

on this point, we haven't monitored long enough nor closely enough to identify those transfusion transmitted infections resulting from the expansion.

i'm not doing that. however many articles and journalists do. this article is probably one of the better ones on that point, since it explains the respective roles and why these pressure groups are targeting trudeau:

per the article:

&gt; while the federal government’s most recent messaging is that the responsibility largely lies with the blood agencies, critics have pointed to a section of canada’s blood regulations that spells out how the health minister has the ability to change the terms and conditions of blood donations if it is deemed necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; as the system operates currently, blood donation practices are determined and implemented by the blood agencies canadian blood services and hema-quebec, following authorizations issued by health canada.
&gt; 
&gt; “for any changes to donor eligibility criteria to be approved, canadian blood services must provide evidence to health canada, our regulator, that the changes are safe and supported by stakeholder groups, especially patients,” said canadian blood services spokesperson delphine denis.
&gt; 
&gt; from health canada’s perspective, these arms-length organizations operate independently, other than relying on the agency to sign off on changes to their practices and therefore, the agency claims “there are no federal regulations prohibiting men who have sex with men (msm) and other groups from donating blood.”

essentially, these articles and the pressure groups behind them are asking the federal government to **override** the decision making capacity of the experts and the science and consultative processes through which they make the decisions.",liberals

i can’t say i’ve met very many racist, xenophobic or transphobic liberals in my time. i’m sure they exist, but liberal policies tend to drive off people like that. look at the jorden peterson debacle and the pronoun debate, do you think a transphobic person would vote liberal after that? why would a xenophobic person vote liberal when the liberals are trying to bring in more immigrants than ever before? why would a racist vote liberal when the liberals gave additional support for black entrepreneurs and business owners, not to mention their leader marches with blm and acknowledges systemic racism?



are the liberals left enough? not for me, but let’s not play the “both sides are just as bad!” card that trump loving republicans like to use. the cpc has a massive issue with racist, transphobic, xenophobic and homophobic people in their party. maybe the liberals have some people like that in their base, but it’s no where near what it is in the cpc.

selling them at a discount wouldn't provide affordable housing. a private company forced to rent part of their property at a discount is a recipe for disaster (best case scenario is  undermaintenance and the smallest possible rent subsidies). so turning over the units to government ownership is the only way i can see this idea being feasible outside throwing government money at private companies.

affordable housing is far more complex than just the construction of units. sustainable affordability often requires sustained funding, or at the very least a significant foregoing of profits. instead of finding tricks to try and induce private companies to build housing, the government should just build and own its own housing. and not just subsidized units - the government should own a lot of housing and use rental income from regular units to subsidize affordable units. after capital investment it would be a revenue stream for the public.",liberals

remember that a newborn is not fully developed so if you're arguing for only considering fully developed human beings people, then you are excluding a lot of human beings currently considered to be people.  nor is this simply a matter of not yet having reached sexual maturity or adulthood.  human beings undergo much of our development outside of the womb which other mammals undergo in utero because if we didn't our large heads would invariably kill our mothers during their first childbirth.

second, your claim that it's simply a matter of independence is not valid.   large swaths of the population from the very old to the very young are absolutely dependent on others for their survival.  and yet i doubt very much you'd consider a quadriplegic a non-person. nor do you seem to consider that third trimester fetuses can be induced, delivered and survive quite well under the care of other  people, (much like a quadriplegic), and so they're not \"biologically dependent of it's mother\" as you put it.  

with your criteria then, the stage of human development at which you consider a fetus to be a person should in fact be shortly after the second trimester, not at birth.     not surprisingly, a lot of people think that's when a person truly begins, not at birth, not at conception, but part way through the fetal stage of human life.

and taking your criteria at face value, that's where you have it as well.

&gt; child rape is rightly illegal because there is real documented scientific evidence that sexual abuse is very damaging. 

agreed, but if they're not persons, then it's not damaging to a person.   and remember, you are arguing that personhood is socially constructed, so if a culture says a child is not a person, then *under your reasoning* raping children doesn't damage a person at all.

**************************
you're insisting that personhood is a social construction and yet your criteria is scientific.  but that criteria places personhood's beginning earlier that you say you think it is.   

you say that it's merely socially constructed, but do you really believe that?  would you look at a society in which men were free to rape children and women on the basis that women and young children weren't people and say \"well that's the culture, so it's not really wrong\"?",conservatives

communities use some language differently. brother is a term that is more common in certain communities such as the black community as well as many muslim communities, which have significant historical overlap with black communities. i'm not defending her original statement by any means. 

ultimately my point is that a german or german-canadian calling nazis their brother is different because white supremacy uses terms like brother and fatherland etc. as a way to differentiate themselves from non-white people. some muslim communities use the term a lot more generally. one is white supremacist coded and the other is a common way to address people.

context is always important when analyzing language choice. 
another example would be a black person refering to another black person as the n word. this can be a common, familial and friendly greeting in this context. a white person calling a black person the n word is never friendly. obviously this is not a perfect analogy for the ways brother can be used. the point is just to show how context changes how we should perceive language.",liberals

kenney was already seeing support slip before the pandemic, but whether by his own doing or his ministers or the lunatic fringe in his caucus, he hasn't been able to put a right foot forward for the better part of two years. it's just astonishing to see the collapse in support, and the general view from both the right and the left in alberta that kenney is a bad premier running a bad government by a bad party.",conservatives

why does china and india pollute so much? because they are the factories of the world. western nations don’t pollute that much because we now get india and china to make all of our shit, their relaxed environmental laws allow the waste to pollute. all the profit drains out of the countries into western corporations and like western nations during our own modernization the little money flowing in is spent on advancing the economy and not waste cleanup.

- building code is not a federal responsibility, but they do indeed have a national building code they provide to provinces as a guideline. alot provinces use the nbc as a basis for their own revisions.

in safe liberal seats such as many in toronto and i'm sure elsewhere, voting for the ndp or any other alternative party can serve the purpose of expressing a political sentiment and contribute to their national vote total or help them build momentum over time in that riding to become more viable or send a message of some degree of accountability to the local liberal mp, but still not in any way meaningfully risk a cpc win of the seat.

similarly in safe cpc seats where the liberals historically don't win and aren't in striking distance (of which i imagine there are many across the prairies), voting for the ndp or another party to help them become viable in the riding over time and support them is just as legitimate as voting for the liberals.

the only place where strategic voting for the liberals should be a factor is where the cpc actually has a reasonable possibility of winning the seat and concentrated strategic support of the liberals could prevent that. the idea that people voting for ndp or any other party in a safe liberal seat or a safe cpc seat are rooting for the cpc is quite a stretch. there's no need to run up the score for the liberals in safe liberal ridings and no reason to support the liberals in safe cpc ridings they'll never win. and framing not voting for the liberals in these contexts as supporting the cpc or leading to a cpc win is fundamentally not correct.",liberals

looking at older elections, most of the supposed ndp ridings actually have the bulk of the ndp vote (by percentage) going to the lpc or cpc, depending on how far west you go.

really, outside of north ontario, hamilton centre, guelph, a handful down east, and bc, a vote for the ndp is effectively a way to pad the cpc vote.

if you look at the election results from any of the general elections, there are relatively few \"safe\" seats, outside of the toronto core for the lpc, and alberta for the cpc.  a great many ridings had wins decided by fewer than 2000 votes.

that's the issue that turned the \"orange wave\" into a harper government.  because a strong ndp turnout isn't strong enough to do anything except give the conservatives seats.

to anyone that knew trudeau and the lpc at the time the only acceptable non-fptp system that would work was a ranked ballot or stv scheme.  they weren't interested in a proportional system (which they thought would lead to a mess like israel where tiny ultra-nationalist parties control the balance of power) or a referendum (which has shown to repeatedly fail in canada because of inertia.

the committee insisted on both proportional (rejecting the stv option) and referendum options.  so it was a non-starter. if the committee had agreed to simply implement an stv, we'd almost certainly have had it in 2019.",liberals

if the virus that arrived here a year ago had been just a little more infectious, or if these uk variants had shown up here in october rather than in january, there's a good chance that our healthcare system would've buckled under a pressure level that all the other g7 countries were able to deal with. and things would've been catastrophic if toronto or montreal, rather than new york, had been where the more infectious european strain of covid arrived in february 2020.",liberals

nope. the part that looks libertarian is the libertarian policies. dismantling the federal government, cutting taxes, giving lost pre-covid freedoms back, eliminating government mandated monopolies, cutting regulations, individual freedom. plenty of which i disagree with.

&gt;fascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th-century europe.

your quoted section alone does not at all describe a fascist platform. they want to reduce immigration and greatly increase the degree to which immigrants are expected to assimilate into canadian society. similar kinds of policies can be found in many countries around the world that aren't fascist. india, sweden, japan and korea to name a few. there is no mention of authoritarianism or ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power. it mentions nothing of suppression of opposition or societal/economic regimentation.

hcqh863,2021-09-13T06:30:54.000-07:00,"time to ditch first-past-the-post electoral system i think ranked balloting is great (i wish the ndp hadn't torched it in committee), i just disagree with the extremely dramatic nature of your characterization. it is beneficial to give voters a practical way of more specifically expressing their voting intentions - ranked does that. but to call the system \"rigged\" as it is is ridiculous. you have choices, and your vote can impact the outcome, unless you choose to vote for something that so few other people want that it has little to no chance of succeeding. 

&gt;strategic voting is based on perception, not reality.

correction: *politics* is based on perception, not reality. because reality must be perceived by observers who are inobjective. they cannot base their decision on *what is* reality - they necessarily have to base their decision on what they perceive to be reality.

&gt;you are presenting strategic voting as far more straightforward and without consequence than it is.

consequences like actually having an impact on an election? 

&gt;studies show this perception is pretty different among the electorate come election time.

this is too vague to be rebutted. 

&gt;what's more strategic voting can and does backfire to benefit the party you don't want to help. 

look at any riding where the parties are all in the 30s and the conservative wins. strategic voting could preserve a far more palatable outcome for a majority of the electorate in those cases. it could backfire in incredibly close three-way races (of which there aren't too many), and it can also fail in cases of poorly informed voters in less close races, but it's silly to suggest that you should resign yourself to wasting your vote on an unachievable ideal just because you might occasionally get it wrong.

&gt;if that's the entire point of strategic voting, you might as well just vote your mind and encourage others to do the same.

if i were alright with conservative governments, i would, but i'm not, so i won't. 

the *entire point* of strategic voting is to accept that your preferred option (depending on where you are) has such a low probability of success that it isn't really even worthy of consideration as an option, and instead choosing between one of the options that are actually capable of occurring. like right now, in my riding, the ndp are trailing by double digits - by an amount large enough that the polls would have to be historically inaccurate or there would have to be a historic swing in order for them to win. the cpc and lpc are within the margin of error. if you vote for the ndp, you're choosing not to choose by picking an outcome with zero chance of success. 

i've lived in ridings where the opposite is true and the liberals are solidly in third, and i've voted ndp. the ndp will always try to find ways to push back against this because with the ndp having a more narrow potential pool of voters, it typically benefits the liberals, but the reality is that for many of us, we'd rather one or the other to a conservative any day of the week, and that's a perfectly valid expression of my personal political interests.",liberals

maybe something along the lines of...

* an outright **ban** on foreign ownership, not dressing up a 20% tax as something huge (especially when ontario and bc already have a 15% tax).
* an actual hefty tax on the purchase/sale of properties beyond your first; say, 50% for your second property, 70% for your third...if not just an outright ban on owning more than one or two properties.
* an actual hefty empty units tax (again, on the order of 50%...these taxes absolutely must be eye-poppingly high enough to make using real estate as an investment vehicle a financial nonstarter).
* proper rent caps (not a maximum percentage increase per year) that don't change when tenants do.
* direction to the bank of canada to end its inflationary policies of ultra low interest rates and begin stepping rates back up to historical (pre-2008) average.
* reforms and heavy regulation of the buying/selling process. ending blind bids, cutting down on incentives and advertisement by realtors, lowering commissions. anything to make real estate a less lucrative profession.

now these would be some concrete actions that the ndp could take to deflate our housing crisis in this country. but they won't, because they're timid and only exist to prop up and bend over for the liberals at this point. and i say this as someone who has never voted ndp before in my life, but who would strongly consider it if they came out with a plan for housing that would have a real deflationary effect on prices.

canada as a country will never get ahead economically if real estate continues to be the only bedrock of our economy, and if workers and young professionals can't afford a place to live. better to rip this band-aid off now before it gets any worse, endure whatever consequences will come from it in the short-term (not to mention the shrieking from thousands of landlords facing the horror of maybe having to get real jobs), and build an economy where most of our capital isn't tied up in housing.",liberals

however, wanting to stop international travels is not remotely the same. i don't know how closely you've been following the covid situation in india, but it is an absolute nightmare. the new variant has spread like wildfire, and it is deadlier than earlier variants we have seen. as soon as reports came out of the situation in india we should have stopped travel to and from there, because the last thing we need right now - particularly during this third wave ontario's experiencing, is more outbreaks. i'm a liberal, but trudeau's sluggishness to take measures on international travel is really one of my biggest beefs with this government.

cupe is missing the mark here. mississauga and brampton, who combined have 22% of canada's south asian population, had been begging the federal government to ban travel to and from that region. the mayors and councillors of these cities have to cater to the south asian vote, so i doubt they were scapegoating. but let me ask you, when cases come in from india and pakistan, who do you think is going to be hit first? the people that these incoming passengers have first contact with, i.e. south asian canadians.",liberals

can you substantiate your allegations that most voters who don't vote ndp do so because they consider the party to be too far left?

i'm sure that such voters exist, but i also think that there are many who only vote liberal because they see this party as having the best chance of defeating the conservatives, and would happily vote ndp if not for the inherent flaws of fptp. similar story in quebec with bloc voters.

in terms of \"moderating their message\" and \"waiting for the liberas to fail\", you could make the same argument for the federal conservatives.

in my opinion the ndp needs  to work on:

\\-combating the perception that they are a wasted vote/helping to elect conservatives

\\-filling their ranks with candidates who have experience actually governing, in order to combat the perception that their ideas are untried

\\-regaining their traditional blue collar base that has shifted towards the conservatives without alienating their newer urban voters

\\-prioritizing messages that grab the attention of voters rather than things that sound nice, but aren't seen as urgent

while it is true that canada now has access to a wider portfolio of vaccine options, that came as a result of originally having all of our \"eggs\" in one chinese basket, and then having to scramble to play catch up (https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/chinese-government-interference-derailed-canadian-vaccine-partnership-researcher-1.5344258). sure, canada has now \"secured\" the world's largest per-capita supply of vaccines, enough to inoculate far more people than live in canada, but that comes at a cost. one article likened canada's approach to betting on almost all of the horses running in a race and hoping for the best (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/canada-coronavirus-vaccine-rollout-slow/2021/01/14/80617754-49f3-11eb-a9f4-0e668b9772ba_story.html)

this chart indicates that canada purchased more than 350 million doses of the vaccine. even if two doses are needed per person that is about 5 times the total number of doses that canada would require (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tracking-covid-19-vaccines-around-the-world/). here is another source that indicates that canada had \"secured\" 414 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020 (https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/12/03/942303736/how-rich-countries-are-hoarding-the-worlds-vaccines-in-charts)

i think either option would create plenty of traps for o'toole, though the by election would mean fewer distractions.

if lewis is the candidate in a by election, because of how divisive her record is, it's going to be brought up a lot, and likely be more front and centre in the news, than if it had to compete with news from 337 other ridings, plus whatever the party leaders are doing that day. it would be really bad, unless she somehow flips the switch, and tones down her social conservative aspects, which i don't see happening.

in a general election, all the negatives are still there, though with the many stories an election can create, it isn't a sure thing that her record would capture the national narrative. however, it's something the lpc and ndp would for sure what to get on the national stage, so it would come up at some point.

her politics will turn off a lot of the middle of the road folks that he needs to get a majority, or even a plurality but she is also a woman and non white. which are 2 demographics that the conservatives could use a lot more of. 

unless she does something horrendous there is no way that they can remove her from caucus with looking bad.",conservatives

it’s a fantasy, most of what conservatives believe is pure imagination. it’s fantasies about how things should be and being one of the chosen people. 
-they often believe in some kind of religion, and are convinced they is right while others are not.
-they believe in economics and believe in some kind of invisible hand controlling it. 
-they believe that soldiers are always heroes and can do no wrong. they believe we are ‘winning’ the war.
-they believe whatever crap somebody tells them on fox news.
-they believed you could unite religious fanatics, farmers, and those who play in finance. 
-did i mention the claims of faith, believing in miracles, virgin births, and resurrection? religion is a con.

the best thing for conservatives would be to lose anything symbolic or otherwise to rally around. if kenney is booted, you can hope that a few will wander off, and maybe come a little closer to what the reasonable people expect from governance. we want able administrators who are not ideologues. right, left, and green would unite on that principle. if he did his job well, he would not be in this situation. however, jason kenney is bad at his job as premiere, he acts as if he is on some kind of crusade. better for all if he is removed from position. peacefully of course.

that's low.

obviously nobody likes covid restrictions. we want this thing over as fast as possible. but using that to fundraise and spread conspiracies and weaken your own government is shameful.

unless loewen is 100% prepared to take full control of the situation, and has a plan that will better the lives of millions of people, i think he needs to shut up and stay in his lane.

these conspiracy people will be the death of the conservative party. if you want the lockdowns to end, get the vaccine now.

&gt;on friday, trudeau described the current shortages as “turbulence,” and said he knows that while thousands of canadians are experiencing relief knowing someone they love is in the process of being immunized, millions of canadians are still waiting their turn and are watching the ups and downs with concern.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“i hear it from all canadians right now… they want to know when they can go back to everything they've done before... when the vaccines are going to come? that's why there's a lot of anxiety and there's a lot of noise going on right now**,” trudeau said during his rideau cottage address.  
&gt;  
&gt;“i know how tired we all are. i know how anxious we are to see our loved ones safe, to see life returning to normal. we feel it too,” he said.

unless the actual interview includes additional content not mentioned here - or perhaps how he said it (the article referenced here doesn't seem to include the video segment) -that in itself doesn't seem either dismissive, tone-deaf or inflammatory. perhaps 'noise' isn't the right term, but it is acknowledging the fact that people are stressed out about our current lack of vaccines and that there is a lot of discussion going on about it.

the lpc spent the money, and then tried to stop it.

so in terms of that, ndp is closer to lpc.

ndp closer to lpc in this case.   


on a whole, while the ndp and lpc have their differences, they are closer in terms of policy than they are with the cpc. the question is whether those smaller differences between the lpc and ndp is enough to let the cpc and their much bigger differences into power.

instead they called an election and stumbled around with \"blue guy bad\" - then released a platform that they would probably have been likely to pass in the ndp/bloc supported government. there really was no need to approve a new mandate for anything they've proposed so far, and i think people are realizing that, and angry about the 600m power grab.

i don't know if this was done on purpose, but this is a completely false interpretation of the data. the 41% figure represents the percentage of people having been vaccinated **at least once**, which already includes the fully vaccinated. francis is double counting the fully vaccinated when adding together 41% and 27% to get her 67%.",liberals
