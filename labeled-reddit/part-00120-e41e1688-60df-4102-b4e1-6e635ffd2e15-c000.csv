i mean until the party can resonate with more voters i can’t see them being taken seriously. if you look at a lot of the ridings on the country, they swing liberal or conservative with ndp at a very distant third. this is very evident especially in suburban ridings where most of canada lives. 

i am very self aware that the ndp is not far left but that’s not how most canadians view them. that’s a huge problem for the ndp. they need to work on their branding. calling voters essentially “low information” for not understanding the parties ideology isn’t going to win elections.",liberals

if he can gain the seats necessary in quebec by winning 15 more (which looks possible), those losses are still going to make it difficult to get to 170. you can only push vote efficiency so far. 

one thing to keep in mind, the projected seat count they have right now already has a built in gain from quebec, otherwise he might even be favoured to win the most seats right now.

you're right about the sks being pinned, but that's such a trivial thing to modify that it's hardly any more safe than a pinned 10 round mag in an m1a. at least in my opinion it's no more safe than any other pinned magazine. you can also modify the sks to accept ak mags. and if the m1a comparison isn't apt, then how about the mini 14? that fires intermediate cartridges and was banned, and used pinned or factory 5 round mags as well (as i understand it, never shot one). 

regardless, this is all kind of my point though, if the deciding factor of banning one and not the other is removable mags and larger cartridges, shouldn't that be addressed instead of banning things by name? what's stopping a manufacturer from making a variant of a rifle that's not currently on the banned list that's exactly the same as the banned variant? it just seems to be that if we're going to be banning weapons we should be doing so on merits rather than models.

and canadian mining companies \"are willing to dig through soil that is soaked in the blood of tigrayans, if that means that they can make a buck...tigray is covered in mass graves that these corporations would not think twice about excavating to get to the gold underneath\"

these are just two quotes from the latest episode of the red review, brought to you by socialist action canada, which is being shared on social media under the hashtags #tigraygenocide and #trudeaufailedtigray. daniel speaks with fifi, a lead organizer with tigrayan advocacy canada about the genocidal war being waged against the tigray. for over a year, the ethiopian state, led by prime minister abiy ahmed, wages a genocidal campaign against the tigrayan people. while the ethiopian state weaponizes famine, gender- and sexual-based violence, massacres, and concentration camps to eliminate tigrayan people, the canadian state remains silent on the conduct of its diplomatic and economic partner. worse, canadian mining companies are treating the current war as an opportunity — a 'bonanza' — to secure access to gold deposits in tigray.

the high cost of the aforementioned goods in the 70s and 80s was the novelty of them. as time passed, more manufacturers jumped on board, creating competition, and driving price down. reality is that rich people need to buy goods, and gradually these goods will trickle down to everyone else as they become more affordable. that's the real effect of trickle down economics. in more recent times, we saw this exact effect with cell phones. the first cell phones of the 80s cost around $4,000 usd (roughly $9,300 cad today). now a fully functional smartphone that can take the place of a camera, computer, video player, and so much more can be had for $400.

the process of manufacturing is mostly automated by this point. there are not a lot of goods that are made by hand, especially in the electronics world, which is most of our production. farming is one of the last industries to fully automate most of its processes.

now, the $26,000 you're talking about, here we can see where the real issue lies - the money value itself. real wages have certainly not kept pace with inflation, and this is entirely due to our government's money printer. no outside source has any pressure on this - this was entirely the doing of the choices made by the ruling parties from the 70s until now. $26,000 in 1994 (current year - age + 21) is equivalent to $43,252.62. that's not the whole of it, though. current median wage in canada is a whopping $54,630 (all numbers provided from statscan). a quick glance would suggest that's an improvement - but it doesn't tell the whole story. as the income has increased, so has the tax burden, as new bracket thresholds have been crossed combined with increased government spending due to a desire from canadians for more safety nets. as a consequence, this has less left for spending in all areas. combine this with a substantially increased cost of tuition (oh, that's a whole other can of worms...), and the debt burden is huge right from the start. relative purchasing power, which is the only thing that really matters, has steadily decreased since the early 70s. rise of the boomers accounts for a sizeable chunk of this, and immigration along with outsourcing account for most of the rest. these combined factors along with the earlier pleas for more safety nets has left the country in a bad spot.

as for quality of life, certainly more people have vehicles now, but that's also because most houses have two people working ft hours, even through parenthood. women entering the workforce in large numbers nearly doubled the amount of available workers, and following the laws of supply and demand, greatly diminished wages further, combined with increasing the demand for post-secondary which drove up those costs. this is a reality of policy and social acceptance, and i'm certainly not advocating against women in the workplace, i'm just acknowledging a truth about a driving factor. this probably also factors into why people are having less kids. further to why kids are worse now (less parental time) than previous generations. and yes, kids are worse, and a large part of this is that there is no available parent. when the parent is available, they are often stressed from workplace activities, something we've only had to deal with for two or so generations. this is also why immigrant parents, where traditionally the wife is still at home, tend to have more disciplined children. this is currently being explored in psych as a whole, but it is fundamentally what is taught and practiced right now. we need look no further than the education system to see how unruly children are, but then we can question education as well. too many topics to cover as a whole in this forum.

anyways, back to cars. yes, we have more vehicles on the road today, severely out of necessity. the only path back to being single vehicle reliant is one that no one in their right mind is going to advocate for, at least not publicly. even if we were to go with two people sharing a vehicle and commuting with it, you have one person dropping the other off, and making no real difference in amount driven, just in time. the household may have a cost savings from this, but environmentally, there is no savings.

millions have died in wars not because of this, but because we as people have allowed it. the ruling parties and the promises that come from participation in the military, particularly in the usa, are what has been the cause of this. the military industrial complex is very real. lowering the standards of living isn't a solution. tell me, what are you willing to, today, give up. how many vehicles are in your house? why not put your current living place on sale and downsize? make sure not to buy any new clothes, electronics, or anything else for that matter. if you're not willing to, right now, make a bunch of changes, don't insist on others doing so. there are only two people who want everyone else to change while doing nothing themselves - hypocrites and leftists.",liberals

i'm not saying this is what's happening, but am pointing out that the context is important. as a rule, it's probably safe to approach climate proposals with maximum cynicism. even the choice to champion a carbon price rather than global cap-and-trade may be viewed as self-serving. a rich country like canada can afford to emit quite a lot, even at $170/tonne (it's only like 40c/l of gasoline). an emissions budget distributed on anywhere near a per-capita basis, however, could be considerably more expensive.",liberals

are you familiar with terry pratchett, man at arms?

&gt;the reason that the rich were so rich, vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  
  
take boots, for example. he earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. but an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of ok for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. those were the kind of boots vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in ankh-morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  
  
but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  
  
this was the captain samuel vimes 'boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

what you're suggesting simply isn't doable in a lot of cases. i'm sure you're in favour of some sort of wealth redistribution to make up for it, but we all know (whether we admit it or not) that taking from productive people and giving to unproductive people is a bad idea. so, to make up for it, send me your current rations, and i'll state what you're allowed to have. i have a feeling you're willing to give up nothing but want others to give up things, as has been the case with everyone else i've challenged on this issue. straight up - let's make this public. i want you to lead by example.",liberals

new information contradicts.

&gt;regardless the carbon tax isn’t meant to change everyone’s behaviour in a few short years, it’s supposed to be a gradual change that favours low emissions production and over time allows the market to create a solution. in a perfect world, you likely won’t directly see the effects except at the pump.

we're going to make new sources of food, and cultivate them with what, exactly? and then transport them, store them, and all these components will be made from what? oil is the most used product in the world for a reason. sure, if people could open their mind, hemp and nuclear would be used, but they still wouldn't move oil out of number 1.

&gt;the genetic fallacy strikes again. just because you don’t like a source doesn’t discredit it, especially one such as the international monetary fund.

you're committing the fallacy fallacy. imf is discredited as their full support pushed towards mmt, a known broken theory pushing for centralized money. centralized money, as we know, is a terribly bad and easily manipulated system.

&gt;10-20$ extra in taxes is not going to break the bank. mountain out of a molehill.

your entitlement is showing... it's not $10-20 in extra taxes. it's an extra $200 a month in living expenses, hidden in things such as food, heating, clothing, and transportation costs. all basics.

&gt;yeah, no, programs that alleviate pain on the poor dont produce inefficiency. this is just economic illiteracy, given poor people spend a greater portion of their pay check you can significantly grow the economy by putting more money in their hands, raising the minimum wage for example or a negative income tax

that's another part of mmt which is vastly disproven. this is basically broken window fallacy. essentials do not grow the economy.

&gt;unironic climate change denier. yeah get as many pictures as you want, i’ll go grab one of the several thousands of studies on climate change and we can see who comes up short.

you go get your studies, and i'll go get my pictures. each picture being a thousand words, i'll have the evidence, not the theories of the studies (future prediction is nothing but a guess), and see who is right. remember, those same scientists thought an ice age was coming in the 80s. when it comes to guessing the future, we're terrible at it.",liberals

i don't know. i wonder at times. i think the big question about all this is just how predisposed to this could one be? could i fall for that too? could perfectly reasonable people i know now fall for it?

i mean that guy who did those crimes, he was in his 20s too, he's also white. i don't think i could ever go insane like that person, but i know people who have defended trump like there was no tomorrow. they were once reasonable people, and not all of them leaned towards the right.

besides that, it also doesn't necessarily need to be far-right madness. i mean, it could also end up being the other side. we've seen extremism from them too in the past. 

&gt;spend some time on this sub-reddit, or for bonus points, on r/onguardforthee, doing nothing but expressing a socialist perspective in favour of firearm ownership. the sort of thing you'll find on r/socialistra

oh, believe me, i have had enough run-ins with those people to know what you're talking about. i have latino roots, and many of them are happy to explain to me why latin america has the problems it has today. they are happy to talk down to me and ignore everything i tell them about why things are the way they are over there. of course this involves mental gymnastics of every sort to justify why socialism works and why in latin america, it's not socialism but capitalism that's breaking it.

&gt;it won't be long before you feel burdened by hate.

as much as i would like to go on an angry and vulgar rant about how those people don't know what they are talking about, that's still no reason to join in with the madness of the far-right. it's just not an answer for me, it's trying to solve madness with more madness. more importantly, it's just wrong.

rather find myself aimless, alone and withdrawn instead of going crazy and becoming another brainwashed drone. i cannot imagine a worse thing than to have your head hijacked by extremism. the thing that would scare me the most would be to commit some horrible crime, then come to the realization about what i whatever i would have done was terribly wrong and then have to live with that for the rest of my life. that must be terrible.",liberals

1) under o'toole, they're moving in a positive direction.

2) there's a lot of resistance within the party to o'toole's reforms.

3) even if o'toole's reforms became party consensus, there'd still be many things i disagree with them on, many areas where i don't think their policies are the right ones for canada.

4) if o'toole is removed as conservative leader, whoever succeeds him is likely to be less progressive.

5) o'toole has personally made a number of comments i find utterly unacceptable, for example his comments on residential schools.

6) o'toole has voted against the party line on a number of issues, for example on the transgender rights bill, which he should get some credit for.

within that, gasoline was a major factor, as prices at the pump have risen by 41.7 per cent since october of last year.

why is transportation higher? because fuel is higher. why is fuel higher? carbon taxes. just because you see an increase at the pump of only a few percent direct to the carbon tax, doesn't mean that the costs of the carbon tax from the production, refining, and delivery are not affected by the carbon tax. that's the trick of the carbon tax - it increases the price of the product at every step from raw good to final consumer product, and the consumer only sees the final little bit as a direct tax, all the while they pay the tax at every step.",liberals

that's why the oil pipeline is bad. at some point if we're going to meet our obligations we need to see substantial cuts in our oil use. your list above is great, and it a fine laundry list for the campaign trail to show that you're doing something. governments are great at spending cash to make it look like something's being done. if you're pinning everything on the carbon tax more than quadrupling over the next eight years, i certainly hope you're confident that everyone will be perfectly fine with that strategy, especially when the government eventually changes. 

maybe the government's projections are true, and maybe emissions are just about to hit a downward inflection point towards our paris goals. i mean, it's going to be 46°c this afternoon in kamloops, we might want to get working on this thing.",liberals

i took a gander at the subreddit and website of canada housing crisis, some good ideas in there some, some bad. it looks like they are focused more on demand and less on supply, which is an incorrect way to view this problem in my opinion. 

i've said this before, but focusing on restricting foreigners and investors from buying property is not going to solve this problem. we really need to increase the supply of homes in places where people want to live.

focusing on demand so highly is going to abdicate provinces and especially municipalities from responsibility for this disaster, even though they are the primary culprits. instead, i hear a lot of blame on the boc for lowering interest rates and the feds for not cracking down on speculators. 

ultimately [economists](https://www.thestar.com/business/2021/05/17/leading-economist-says-measures-taken-to-cool-housing-market-wont-work-if-you-believe-that-toronto-is-unaffordable-now-just-you-wait.html) and [housing experts](https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/centre-urban-research-land-development/pdfs/cur_assessing_affordable_housing_options_gta.pdf) are pretty clear that we laser focus our efforts on increasing the supply of housing, rather than focusing so much of our anger at the feds and the bank of canada for increasing or not tackling demand.",liberals

i don't think there's anything that can win over the 'any identity but mine is political' folks, other than a return to an imagined society of the 1950s, as represented in the tv of the 70s and 80s. these are a group of people completely overtaken by their conviction that any opinion, fact, or point of view that they do not share is a direct attack on them personally. 

the only way i can see to appeal to them is the kind of virtue-signalling and pandering that the cpc engages in. office-dwelling lawyers putting on cowboy drag and pretending to be 'regular folks' to appeal to people that they would otherwise never share a room with. 

unfortunately, your suggestion to present theselves as 'down to earth' would require the aforementioned cowboy/oilworker drag and never suggesting any kind of meaningful change in the way they live their lives. 

the 'fuck ottawa' crowd is just a subset of the 'only my idpol is acceptable crowd\" that likes to virtue-signal with performative hatred. i suspect they'd make a point of hating any and everything that the 'wrong' party did - even if it directly benefited them and only them.",liberals

h8z42qj,2021-08-14T10:35:24.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] i think that the ndp is poised to grow its support. 

they have a popular leader and their only provincial government is pretty popular right now. provincial polling also shows strong support for the alberta ndp and improving prospects in ontario and nova scotia. i don't expect that it will be enough to win, especially given the party's quebec struggles, but i expect at least a 1988-level performance.

the greens lost an mp to the liberals recently, and divisions within the party will prevent them from growing. that said, i think that may and manly will both be fine: may is high profile and is the default abc choice in her riding, and the circumstances under which the ndp threw manly under the bus when he sought their nomination could make them a hard sell with progressive voters in his riding. 

as for the tories, the wedge issues that the tories campaign on don't resonate in québec (which is why caq voters tend to prefer the bq and even the liberals), which will stifle their growth there. moreover, ford and kenney are not well-liked, which will cause the tories to underperform in ontario and alberta. i also expect a disappointing performance in bc, as right-wing politics in bc are dying a slow death outside of the bible belt and the southern interior.

the bloc québécois will battle the liberals for supremacy in regional quebec, but they will continue to get eviscerated in the ncr/outaouais (where they won the odd victory in the period between 2004 and 2008)and in greater montreal; the bloc's move away from social democracy and multiculturalism after the 2011 election have led to the liberals taking some of the bloc's old montreal seats from the ndp in the wake of the latter's post-layton collapse. many of these montreal voters support quebec solidaire provincially, so it's unlikely that they'll stay liberal in future elections if the ndp becomes viable or the bloc moves left again.

though they will lose ground to the ndp, the liberals will do well enough in ontario, québec, bc, and atlantic canada to retain a plurality of seats. it'll be jagmeet singh's popularity and the resulting growth in ndp support that will stop trudeau from winning his majority.",liberals

i read he was finally kicked out because he accepted a campaign donation, which i believe was pretty small from some guy i never heard of who has opinions some people don't like. to be honest, i doubt most mps background check every donor they have... most of them would probably be willing to take a dollar from pretty much anyone if it got them elected, even a homeless person. 

seemed to me that he threw the guy under the bus in a political climate that didn't seem to warrant it... he just thought it would play well among the masses or something.",conservatives
