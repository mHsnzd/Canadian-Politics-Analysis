(edit: pierre) trudeau never even wanted the nwc in the first place but the premiers insisted on it, and chretien sold him on the idea. chretien's justification was \"don't worry, it's gonna be an emergency last-ditch option that governments will be afraid to ever use.\"

yeah, well quebec didn't even sign onto the charter and never liked it in the first place, so of course they were gonna make liberal use of a loophole like this one. invoking s. 33 became normalized and mainstream, and the end result is we've emboldened idiots like doug ford to use it as a political sledgehammer.

i long for a day when canadian politicians finally grow a pair and accept that our constitution cannot last the way it's currently framed. at the very least, even if we don't change anything else, let's remove this loophole from the constitution.",liberals

when you're in a crisis, you run deficits to stimulate the economy. this is a pretty well-accepted part of economics for anyone outside the austrian school.

so where do i criticize trudeau? 2020 wasn't our first deficit. in fact, trudeau has run a deficit *every single year* despite 2017-2019 being the height of the business cycle. it is absolutely unjustifiable to be running deficits in good times.

&gt;i don’t know of many economists that were particularly critical of the fiscal position before covid

there was *plenty* of criticism of the fact that trudeau was running deficits at the top of the business cycle. hell if you just read the parliamentary budget office's reports from the last few years there's plenty of trudeau's budget claims that they take issue with.

the trouble with aggregate debt levels is it takes 10-20 years for the problems to really manifest. trudeau's father was responsible for accumulating an enormous amount of debt in the 1970s, but the resultant fiscal crisis didn't hit until the late 1980s/early 1990s. all of the chretien/martin fiscal downloads and the associated provincial fiscal fallout (which led to things like the sale of highway 407) were directly caused by pet's massive debt from 20 years before, but by the time people had to deal with the consequences he was gone.

canadian lpc back benchers have the power right now to toss out their party leader and select a new one.  they choose not to do that.

look at how they lined up to kick the attorney general out of her party for her disagreement with the prime minister.   and even if you think she should have been kicked out, note how they also kicked out ms. philpott.   there's no coherent argument for kicking out ms. philpott other than for not being suitably loyal **to justin trudeau**.   

the mps don't have that power because they don't want to have it.

edit: /u/ed-rock isn't wrong, but you can't get away from the big uncomfortable reason is because the back benchers refuse to use the power they have and voters don't like it if they try.   think about it: how many lpc voters refused to vote lpc last election because of what justin trudeau did to jane philpott?   very few.   and it would be basically the same for cpc &amp; ndp voters.  

canadians *say* they want that to happen.   our actions say we care more about our party winning than anything else.

although i believe /u/ed-rock is mistaken on the 1970 elections act as any party is able to structure itself so that it can't be hijacked.   after all, parties are private organizations.  they could choose their official candidates whoever they like.   (otherwise, you'd have a very obvious opportunity to take over local riding associations and run a conservative as the \"lpc\" candidate and another conservative as the cpc candidate.)

and there lies the critical fault with the cpc. you’re right that it only takes a fraction of voters to take over ridings, except mainstream canada really doesn’t care about political parties (we’re the exception in this sub, not the rule lol). 

so then you’re left with non-mainstream canada as the most motivated group that wants to change canada, so those people are the ones that take over riding associations and convention delegate spots. they force cpc leaders to appear further right then they really are, and do shit like vote down climate change being real at a convention. that’s what happens to a party when they design the rules to encourage grassroots participation. it also happens to the ndp, their conventions are usually only good to stir up internal controversy too.

that’s the one thing the lpc does better, they understand if you leave everything 100% up to the grassroots then you’re susceptible to waves of anti-establishment populism that think they can change your party but only end up making you all look foolish.

that being said the downside of the way the lpc does it is it does create a larger divide between “insiders” and the general public, which has a habit of bleeding into their governing style (adscam, snc, etc.), so maybe it’s a simple matter of picking your poison.",conservatives

all of these have to be weighed against the benefits of cheap electricity, rapid economic growth, and political stability.

&gt; why would *canadians* voluntarily forego cheaper energy from fossil fuels without another country telling us to do so?

indeed, why would we?

the chretien government committed to a 45% reduction in emissions under the kyoto accord, but wasn't willing to take the costly and politically difficult actions to meet that target (a $200/t carbon tax); see *hot air* by jaccard, rivers, and simpson. dion proposed a revenue-neutral carbon tax and was defeated by harper in the 2008 election, who called it a \"tax on everything\" and who withdrew canada from the kyoto accord.

what [made a huge difference](https://energi.media/markham-on-energy/phillips-kenney-tzeporah-berman-osag-06jul18/) in canada's willingness to consider serious climate policy was external pressure, namely the obama administration's vetoing the keystone xl pipeline in early 2015 despite harper calling it a \"no-brainer.\" this is what drove alberta adopting serious climate policy under the notley government in november 2015, which in turn is what made climate policy possible at the national level. and obviously it's been a fight every step of the way: the federal elections in 2015 and 2019, the ontario election in 2018 and the alberta election in 2019, the court battles with saskatchewan, ontario, and alberta, now the fight [between erin o'toole and his own party](https://twitter.com/russilwvong/status/1383520928475144195?s=20).",conservatives

more importantly, they leave out examples that run contrary to the narrative about loyalty and so-called “scandals.”

let’s look at the first three cabinet ministers who lost their jobs under this pm:

stephane dion - notoriously difficult to work with, had a long history of being antagonistic to the pm and his own cabinet colleagues.

john mccallum - notoriously unreliable, though he was very experienced.

maryann mihychuk - a massive ego that sent her spiraling into conflict with several caucus colleagues combined with an inability to move important files forward.

so it seems to me that performance is a key factor here. even in the philpott and jwr cases, the pm gave them lots of time and latitude and vent. in fact, he never actually booted them from cabinet. they resigned themselves. he only booted them from caucus once it became apparent that there was no restoring trust between them and caucus.

and finally, bill morneau - gone because he made some big, big mistakes.

i'd also question whether the \"millions in support\" is really as generous as people think.

https://www.fraserinstitute.org/article/taxpayers-are-generous-first-nations

the article claims that canadians are being generous, but the spending numbers don't really suggest that first nations people are receiving more than anyone else.

eg.

&gt; provincially, data was more difficult to find but from the mid-1990s forward, here is what the numbers show: in 2012, the 10 provinces combined spent $812 per first nations person, up 985 per cent from $75 per first nations person in 1994.
&gt; 
&gt; in contrast, provincial government program spending on all citizens also rose but much more modestly, to $9,205 per person in 2012 from $7,340 in 1994, or a 25 per cent increase. again, all numbers are adjusted for inflation (and population growth is accounted for because these are per person measurements).",liberals

people also may not be aware of something here; the liberal government (before the grave sites were brought to light) was in an active court battle with the indigenous people of canada. they had offered them like 10k a person plus some other stuff and was basically saying take it or leave it.... then all of a sudden the schools and the graves came to light and now that court case is screwed completely. the liberals basically have to give them whatever they want now. and don't take what im saying as me putting down indigenous people because my spouse is indigenous and i have massive respect and love for her and her family. she was the one who told me about this court case.

headlines don't match the content of the article.   this is not a vibrant community. it' a dead one.

[https://montreal.citynews.ca/2019/03/31/transplants-help-keep-quebec-citys-small-anglophone-community-vibrant/](https://montreal.citynews.ca/2019/03/31/transplants-help-keep-quebec-citys-small-anglophone-community-vibrant/)

the community consists mostly of

* a few francophile \"american in paris\" style expats that like the old buildings, subsidized arts scene and  lattés; they either assimilate or move on after a few years, sustaining the pattern of assimilation and exodus.
* a few allophone  immigrants that learned english well but speak mostly french and benefit job-wise from the lack of bilingual labor available in the city
* a few \"historic anglophones\" that are really assimilated francophones, speak a little more english than the rest, but really only sense they are anglophone when someone on the bus tells them \"parles-donc comme du monde\" when they actually speak english in public (i.e. \"speak properly\" or \"speak like everyone else\" or \"speak like a person\"). 

the schools are really there just to teach english to the francophone elite that understand the real value of a bilngual education, so the schools are seen as elitist. they don't really sustain a viable community. bill 101 killed off any real community. it's sad, but it's reality. 

examples from article

* every five years, between 20 and 25 per cent of the city’s anglophone minority leave and are replaced by newcomers, wellens, executive director of voice of english-speaking quebec, said in a recent interview. 
* when nadeau, 72, isn’t at the library, acting in plays put on by the quebec art company or singing for the city’s symphony orchestra, she is assigning stories for the paper, which has a weekly circulation of about 2,000 and a $47 annual subscription fee. the paper covers the anglophone community and is kept alive through subscription and advertising revenues, a grant from the canadian heritage department and support from its ontario owners.
* quebec city’s anglophone community began to shrink dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, nadeau said, following the rise of the sovereigntist movement in the province, which sparked an exodus of many english-speakers and big companies.
* there are no anglophone neighbourhoods anymore, she said. but there are english-language schools, which play a critical role in keeping the community alive. in quebec, students are only able to attend english primary and secondary schools if one of their parents received most of their education in english in canada.
* antoine theodorakis was born in quebec city, and his grandfather immigrated from greece. “i speak more french,” said the 19-year-old, but he chose the english-language college because he said it opens more doors. “a lot of people think st. lawrence is a private school, and we’re seen as rich kids,” he said. “they say it’s snobbish.”
* nineteen-year-old jeremy poulin’s family goes back generations in quebec city and he doesn’t know whether to consider himself anglophone or francophone. “depends on the day,” he said with a chuckle. he said sometimes people make derisive comments when he speaks english on the bus. “i’ve heard more than once, ‘go back to your country,’ addressed at me,” he said.",liberals

ha4l06g,2021-08-23T15:04:03.000-07:00,"trudeau off to rocky start in canada’s snap election campaign the problem with debt, monetary policy and immigration though is that they also strongly influence other aspects of the economy. people need government services, businesses need capital, people need jobs, population needs to grow etc. for a functioning modern society.

for debt, businesses that did renovations while they were closed anyway, those that needed to go into debt, households that went into debt, government keeping people afloat and able to return to the workforce afteretc. these public and private debts allows us to invest in economic growth and then pay it off.

for monetary policy, it helps with liquidity for the above debt and increased inflation helps protect against the massive deflationary forces of a pandemic and an aging population. increased inflation also helps the debt shrink.

immigration helps with the gdp and wealth of the nation, especially as the population ages and shrinks as boomers get older. it also will be important for geopolitical positioning as canada becomes a very attractive destination with abundant resources as climate change progresses. it also allows us to spread democracy and freedoms by exerting soft power on countries with high emigrants to canada.

this is a big part of why these are federal responsibilities. they're important to many national goals in addition to housing.

the best tool the feds have is the one specific to housing; to financially force provinces/municipalities to make policy serve the country instead of special interests.",liberals

h2rcw82,2021-06-22T22:13:23.000-07:00,"mps pass a bill to ban conversion therapy in canada in reality it absolutely wouldn't impede medical professionals from doing their job. we don't live in a country where informed consent is the default way to go for trans healthcare, our medical professionals generally still follow the wpath model or stricter models of care. the most lenient assessments would still follow the \"persistent, insistent, consistent\" method where you repeatedly gauge the patient's authenticity and sincerity over a drawn out period of time, particularly when it comes to trans youth. 

like, there are still conservatives out there who thought zucker didn't do anything wrong when his methods were by the book child abuse. just because that conversion therapy isn't allowed doesn't mean medical professionals can't do their jobs, it means they can't abuse their patients and have the families of their patients abuse them as a way to try and force them into being something they're not. the medical professionals should not go into these scenarios with the mindset that their patient's not trans, or cannot be trans, or that it would be best for the family/patient that they're not trans. they instead should do their jobs and help assess the patient and make sure they're on the correct path for them and make sure they've thought critically about this step. when people assert they're trans and they show they're persistent, insistent, and consistent, the rate of regret is a fair bit below 1%, and the vast majority of that demographic only regret it due to social and financial hardships, and almost always stick with transitioning, or retransition after detransitioning until they're in a more secure situation. 

ultimately, this bill won't stop all conversion therapy, or probably even most of it, since it's not as specific and extensive as it should be, but it's something. and if the pcs get in power and reintroduce a conversion therapy bill, it'll just be words on paper, with enough loopholes written in that all conversion therapists will be free to go on their merry way doing their thing and harming people.",conservatives

&gt;hate messages  
13 (1) it is a discriminatory practice for a person or a group of persons acting in concert to communicate telephonically or to cause to be so communicated, repeatedly, in whole or in part by means of the facilities of a telecommunication undertaking within the legislative authority of parliament, **any matter that is likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt** by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;prohibited grounds of discrimination are:  
3 (1) for all purposes of this act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.

a big criticism is was based on that \"likely to expose\" was \"a hole you could drive a mack truck through,\" and that there is nothing to do with the intent of the person sending the message.

so if i write something critical directed at \"boomers\", \"karens\", etc. someone could argue that this was *likely to expose* a person to *contempt* based on age or sex.",liberals

&gt;in a unanimous decision released friday, the top court said the collection of accounts for independent compensation assessment was meant to be a \"confidential and private process\" and that \"claimants and alleged perpetrators relied on the confidentiality assurance.\" 

&gt;the 38,000 accounts will be retained for a 15-year period, during which time survivors can choose to have their records preserved.

&gt;failing that, the documents will be destroyed.

&gt;applications required survivors to provide \"the most private and most intimate personal information\" and each person attending the hearing was required to sign a confidentiality agreement. 

&gt;\"as a matter of contractual interpretation, destruction is what the parties had bargained for,\" the judgment reads. \"the independent assessment process was intended to be a confidential process, and both claimants and alleged perpetrators had relied on that assurance of confidentiality in deciding to participate.\"

&gt;**the federal government had fought to retain the records for historical purposes under the library and archives canada.**

pay special attention to that last bolded paragraph. the government did literally the opposite of what you have claimed, in that they actually sued (along with the trc) *to preserve* the documents. 

the 2020 suit was a [direct consequence of that ruling](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/appeal-records-residential-school-1.5973727):

&gt;justice canada, under the direction of bennett's department, argued the reports would violate the privacy of residential school claimants, which is protected by a 2017 supreme court ruling that forbade the archiving of individual claim information held by the secretariat.

our global economy is fast testing many economic orthodoxies though. policy makers have had to get creative over the last 15 years. but it remains to be seen whether central bank balance sheets should have been allowed to ballon quite to the degree that they have. it remains to be seen whether large deficit spending by the liberal government in the years preceding and during the pandemic will end up biting us. mmt is untested at scale in the real world. 

the policies you list also have the advantage in that they have worked in the very recent past quite well across many jurisdictions. it is that package of ideas that is favoured by the imf and world bank and even if we say for arguments sake that they are increasingly losing their shine, they are still respected in academic and policy circles.",conservatives

i don't believe this is the case. hopefully this brief history of school system in quebec might change your point of view a bit.

in the mid 60's school boards were formed in quebec during the quiet revolution. these school boards, catholic and protestant, though they were, were certainly a step towards taking away power from the clergy (who had been running the schools themselves). cegeps were opened around the same time, as the push for education among french took hold. (this is before the pq formed gov. for the first time in 76')

in 1984, the minister of education for the pq, pushed for changing the school boards being divided by confessional lines to linguistic ones. a year later it was shot down on constitutional grounds. in 1988 another law was passed again, \"to come in effect only when the constitutional issues were sorted out\". it is then *only in 1997*, that the federal government accepts changing the constitution to allow non-confessional schools. it takes another year to implement the changes, which happens in 1998.

in 1998 while these first changes are finally underway, the qlp comes into power. the liberal party then holds onto power for the next 20 years, with only a brief 1 year stint of a minority power pq (which was a very turbulent time for the party might i add.) then in 2018 when caq comes into power, the secularism law is tabled.

&gt;https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/commission_scolaire_au_qu%c3%a9bec

i ask you this, how could the pq, push for a secularism law while the school boards themselves were officially catholic with teachers *having* to profess being of catholic faith? they hand their hands full trying to get the church out of the school in an official capacity to start with!

i'll note that pretty much immediately after school boards were changed to english and french, the question about bill-21 type stuff was already being debated publicly, but like i said the liberals were in power and they were on the anti-secularism side of the aisle.",liberals

i don't know what nationalizing other then the government buying something that used to be owned by private enterprise that is literally what the word means.  they now own the industry of shipping oil from edmonton to vancouver.  as an important note trudeau didn't buy the pipeline the federal government did.  the government gets the profit from the pipeline (and that pipeline makes money) and also now gets to collect taxes on all the oil produced that wouldn't be if there was no way to ship it.  the feds bought it because it made the public money.

there is probably a line to say there is a difference between rejecting money and just refusing to spend money or access grants available to provinces (which has happened) but it feels like we are playing semantics games at that point.

it’s extremely silly the way that the conservatives and natpo are trying make hay of this. canada day was never cancelled by anyone, a couple small unimportant town councils decided to have more solemn rather than celebratory municipal events and the rightwing lost their minds.

mark canada day how ever you want to mark it. if you want to get drunk and watch fireworks do that. if you want to quietly sit by the water in a muskoka chair sipping tea and thinkin’’bout life do that. if a town wants a celebratory event good for them if a town wants a solemn event good for them.

conservatives don’t seem to understand that freedom includes the freedom to not clap on cue.

finally, bars and restaurants will be fine. that’s the beauty of capitalism you’re taking that risk. it’s the same beauty that’s inherent in gambling but with slightly better odds and providing services for other people in the process. if you don’t like that then go get a job where you’re not working for yourself...

imo the best role of the ndp is on the policy side, forcing both the lpc and cpc leftwards, e.g. childcare, climate change, healthcare (pharma and dental, in particular). i think the diversity of regional interests preclude the ndp ever winning a plurality of seats unless the party undergoes many changes to become more mainstream -- but those changes are exactly what they despise about the liberals. to be pm, you need to be to appease both the alberta fossil fuel interests and the bc climate change activists, quebec nationalists and the manitoba first nations groups, toronto bay st professionals making &gt;$100k/yr and the new brunswick call center workers making $30k/yr. how the hell could anyone make housing substantively more affordable yet not crash the economy and the investment vehicles of many older canadians? this is why trudeau is often panned for talking out two sides of his mouth... it's a necessity if you want to be a mainstream politician. the bc ndp leader is an example where even an ndp politician must pivot more centre to be electable -- old growth logging being the latest example. the federal ndp would need to do it too. but, i would argue they should instead stay true to themselves, and not give up their ideals for electability because many of their policies are great and they do more good bringing then to the national discourse than if they have to pull a mulcair to take office and then sit on their hands. moreover, some have suggested the ndp find a new leader because singh's religion tempers his electability in quebec. i think giving up their values for electability would be sad, but also mark the end of the ndp. just my $0.02.",liberals

so let's say from your math that each parent makes $5000 after tax income from working. under o'toole's plan, childcare remains extremely unaffordable -- particularly in dense urban areas. if a parent has the choice to work to produce $5000 but have a $3500 childcare expense (i.e. bring in $1500 for the household) versus stay home and take care of their own child (i.e. bring in $0 but not have to work/commute/entrust child to others), too many will choose the latter, constraining the economy and creating artificial worker shortages. the liberal plan changes the calculus completely (work and bring in $4800, i.e. $5000 less $200, versus stay home and bring ing $0). more workers = a faster growing economy = more tax revenue. this is an investment that not only improves people's lives today, but pay for itself in the long run.",conservatives

&gt;a canadian political and intellectual  class is promoting is opposite of unity.

ah, yes. i now agree with you. the current canadian goverment (as an aggragate of all parties) is not really putting any emphasis on unity. just silly legislation for political capital. as for the intellectual class, i haven't come across it yet in my journeys. that is not a jab. i just haven't really encountered someone who identifies as the intellectual class who then shared mainstream intellectual class ideas with me. so on that front, i can't comment.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;can someone really name a single thing trudeau's government did that  promotes unity not only in selfie spirit but a true action that unites?  because i cannot.

just because i quipped that we need unity, doesn't mean that trudeau needs to have the same belief. he didn't campaign on \"unity\". at the same time, maybe he believes his actions do bring unity. the point is that my belief that unity is needed, is not something we can superimpose on trudeau; he never promised more unity.

full disclosure: i am not a trudeau fan. but, he

* sent christia freeland to the west to figure out \"western alienation\". that is a form of uniting.

melting pot being that were all just people and should be tossed together and create a new unified canadian culture that shifts with the times with immigrants melting/merging into that. multiculturalism being that we create a patchwork of cultures withing canada, with immigrants retaining their original cultures. canada also switched as a matter of policy from melting pot to multiculturalism in 1971, intentionally driving this shift.

modern multiculturalism is in some ways similar to what the late kkk (in the 1920s and 30s) wanted. they accepted the existence of other races at that point but instead they demanded a lack of mixing, that racial lines kept to themselves (no miscegenation). that each race maintained their own cultures.

on this very sub i have been told that natives and whites shouldn't breed because this risks dooming the native races, and it was claimed to be a form of genocide. so, no miscegenation is woke i guess.

there is also the concept of 'cultural appropriation', that white people shouldn't be allowed to like things that aren't originally from white cultures. this also shows up in racially charged terms like 'wigger' or 'weeb' or 'twinkie/banana'. even to some degree in the punishment trudeau got for wearing indian clothes ('those are for indians, not for white people').

the reasons given for these new laws, and the issues these regulations are meant to address aren't really controversial. but the problem with this is that this opens to door to regulating speech on the internet. most of the biggest offenders targeted by these regs are *already illegal* so why are we creating a new regulatory body? 

i feel like the slippery slope argument is overused, but i am going to use it here. i think that these regulations start us, or perhaps advance us, down a path that we don't want to go down. these regs allow for the government to force telecoms to block access to certain offending sites. sure, for perfectly good reason now, i'm not going to disagree with targeting child porn and extremism. but we have got to be the first western government taking the step of blocking our citizens from parts of the internet. i see proposed regulations like this and i think of the phrase: \"govern with the worst of intentions in mind\". this might make sense as it's written, but what about the next government, the next batch of bureaucrats? we are handing the government powers that we don't want them to have. it's for a noble cause today, but it might not always be so, it's the reason we have rules and limitations on our governments in the first place. we can't always trust that our leaders have our best interests at heart.

and while it's easy to see why the conservatives might support this, i don't think it's that the ndp are secretly pro-rich. it seems like the mps have bought the story. here is ndp mp alistair macgregor on the bill [c-274 was the previous incantation].

&gt;when bill c-274 was being considered in the previous parliament, i had a meeting with the port renfrew chamber of commerce. i was given a 10-minute speaking spot during their agm, and when i talked about bill c-274 at that time and about what we were hoping to do, i got unanimous positive feedback from the members of that chamber. for those who do not know, port renfrew is on the southwest coast of vancouver island. many people there depend on fishing for their livelihoods. they are either commercial fishermen or are in sport fishing, so they have small fishing corporations. to have the ability put forward to transfer their businesses to family members really meant a lot to them. there was overwhelmingly positive feedback. i ultimately had to give them bad news, but here we are with a real opportunity to try to bring about some positive change.

&gt;this bill is pretty much tailor-made for the types of small businesses that exist in the riding i represent, cowichan—malahat—langford...

i'm not sure what to do about this. one way might be to get better information to the mps. props to michael smart for doing this work.

but even given the information, mps still need to have strong movements in their riding to push them in the right direction. as long as allegedly social democratic mps are taking tax advice from the **chamber of commerce**, we have deeper issues.",conservatives

&gt;feature journalism: features are generally longer than news stories, allow for more creativity, and delve deeper into a topic.  
&gt;  
&gt;investigative journalism: investigative journalists work to undercover corruption and fraud, often in politics or business.  
&gt;  
&gt;opinion pieces, columns, reviews, and analysis pieces: these types of pieces are based more on opinion, but do have elements of journalism and are featured on tv shows, radio programs, newspapers, and more.
