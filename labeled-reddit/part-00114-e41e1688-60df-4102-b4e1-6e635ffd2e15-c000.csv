&gt;why is otoole pro gun control? pro carbon tax?

because he wants to win and these positions are the only way he can do it. it sucks, but most canadians (especially soccer moms) think guns are evil (you can thank the depiction of guns in the american media for that) and erroneously think we alone can save the planet.

scheer lost partly *because* he wasn't seen as doing enough to tackle climate change.

should the federal ndp ever supplant the lpc federally, there's a good chance that eventually the ndp would either move right or the cpc would move left to capture the unclaimed territory near the centre, with the caveat that the centre itself can and does shift.  both of these have been seen historically in countries where the labour party supplanted a liberal party as the primary non-conservative option - sometimes in the same country at different periods.  we even saw the beginnings of it here with mulcair's try for the premiership in 2015.

i'm not really interested in what that \"says\" to hypothetical voter.  horgan isn't obligated to do any favours for singh, nor to even agree with him on basic policy, and the fact that the bcndp has won two elections in a row now - and remains popular - suggests that their policies aren't causing any great unhappiness with the voting populace (this being rather important in a democracy).

you seem to think that there's some canonically \"correct\" way for an \"ndp government\" to behave, or that the provincial governments have some obligation to cheerlead for the federal party, but every provincial branch is its own party that will formulate its own policy that it thinks will work in its own province.",liberals

2. this one is simple. guns, hunting and shooting are part of our traditions. especially the first nations. there is no good reason for banning them all together. even if conservatives are not gun owners themselves (like me), we should protect legal gun owners from government tyranny. 

3. i like the way you frame this. anyways. conservatives believe in individual responsibility. there is no objective benefit for having every industry/profession be gender balanced. women are not prevented from entering certain jobs. women and men are different and make different career, lifestyle and personal choices. our government shouldn't be pushing women into certain careers. women are not stupid and can think for themselves. if women are not attracted by a certain career, that's fine.

if this is what the 'preferred party for progressives' looks like, then i'm sorry the term progressive really has been twisted beyond all meaning. a progressive party would be making policy that *challenged* and even *alienated* class interests of all the groups above. by this measure john tory could qualify as a progressive hero!",conservatives

i want you to re-read this and think about it. 

that makes no sense. this isn't how we decide security risks anywhere in the world. the assessment of national security risk is not a democratic exercise and if it were there would be no such thing as national security. 

the non-partisan public service has rules they follow when redacting things also so unless you think the average joe/jane public service staffer is being paid directly out of the lpc coffers to redact extra information than necessary i don't see how the issue is in trusting the lpc on redactions. they don't do them. 

 there's a whole host of administrative function that intersects with these legal obligations to redact certain things and those functions are messy when it comes to parliamentary privilege. those we can argue about. but the bit about allowing the public to make the call doesnt. 

you can't simply release full documents that include personal, private, sensitive, or security related information to the public through parliament and allow the public to decide what is or isn't acceptable. that's not how our legal frameworks are set up for private information and its not how our national security is best served either.",liberals

convention is irrelevant the moment anyone wants to break it. courts cannot uphold a convention, nor can anyone else except using their incidental powers like the opposition threatening to vote no confidence in a minority government or threatening to use something like refusing a bunch of unanimous consent requests that tends to expedite parliamentary procedure in retaliation, but they have no power to directly influence the specific act which the convention is tying down.

but none of this is relevant if the parliament passes a new law to specifically limit the governor general´s powers. some options for this would be allowing for a new election if any 2/3 of the members of the house of commons vote for it, the failure of the parliament to agree on a prime minister within four months after an election with at least four votes of confidence attempted in a candidate for prime minister (provided this current parliament wasn´t created by the failure of the last parliament to agree within four months), the cabinet requesting a vote of confidence in relation to a statement of policy but not on any other specific bill or motion other than the general budget passing but not including any amendment to the budget and the vote of confidence failing to get at least a majority of mps elected to vote yes, and the parliament not within two weeks agreeing on a new person for prime minister or reinvesting confidence in the last prime minister, or a no confidence vote that is applied by the opposition with no other provisions included in the motion like to defeat a bill, on request of at least 20% of the mps, naming a specific replacement candidate, and this passing by a majority of mps elected (170 of 338, not merely say 155-145 if one party with 38 seats completely abstains), or the failure of the general budget but not any other financial bill to pass on two separate votes to attempt such budget with at least 90 days of debate and votes on incidental, privileged, and subsidiary motions on the budget in the commons, and the cabinet asks for dissolution.

those are similar options to what is provided in many countries today and they make it far easier to check the power of the prime minister. it allows people to have confidence that the parliament will be active for some set length of time, it allows the mps to have confidence that they don´t need to constantly act in campaign mode, it makes the caucus of the prime minister´s party more willing to stand up against them when the prime minister acts autocratically or incompetently without facing a new election, it gives parties more of a reason to engage in good faith negotiations without the knowledge that someone can pull the plug the next morning, it saves parties money in asking for donations which makes them less dependent on big donors, and it saves taxpayers in general hundreds of millions of dollars to actually run the damn election. it makes my blood boil when even opposition parties don´t try to pass such a law constraining the prime minister this way, not even the bloc and ndp where their power is dependent on minority governments existing.",liberals

is there a reason why \"liberal\" parties aren't particularly successful elsewhere in the world? my sense is that it's because centrism isn't really attractive as it's filled with nuance, rather than a top-down progressive or conservative platform that appeals more because it's better defined and easy to comprehend.

&gt;referring to a country which was a product of colonial construction as genocidal, when it was created as a mash-up of several adversarial ethnic groups that were simply pasted together because of colonial structures, undermines the understanding of genocide. were conditions for ethnic violence a result of colonial oppression? almost certainly yes. so we see the labelling of rwanda as a genocidal country, without the necessary framing of the colonial structure that provided this environment for this to flourish, as genocidal is a rule 3 violation. there is a lot of nuance when dealing with these subjects and we expect our users to explain this distinction when making over-arching statements that entire country's are genocidal.

the differences between tutsi and hutu were well-established prior to any colonial appearance in africa. this is admitted by local rwandan historians, and is well documented online.

childcare would not require more taxes as it pays for itself + generates more revenue. 

at this point the areas that the ndp differ strongly from the liberals where it comes to quality of life and democracy for people are:

electoral reform
long term care (public not private)
dental and pharmacare 
paying less for cellphones/internet
public housing units approach

as a traditional dipper, for me those differences with the reality we’re facing aren’t enough to risk childcare and the progress liberals have made elsewhere. everyone has their own calculations - childcare is one of the top 3 policies i have wanted since i could vote - those being electoral reform (thanks justin), childcare (thanks justin in an entirely different way), and the one that will never happen - large scaling land value taxes applied to each additional property after your 1st to stop people from hoarding them. not even the ndp will do the third, and the liberals are at least trying to push through the second...",liberals

even if we remove the extensive expensive and investment of time to properly raise a child, it is an issue of bodily autonomy. part of that autonomy is based on, can i raise this child? can i afford this child? do i want to bring a child into this world? do i want to bring this child into my life? and a million other reasons that are not for others to decide on a will imposed on a fictional person.

haab5z7,2021-08-24T22:48:02.000-07:00,"trudeau’s housing crisis proposals won’t keep prices from rising, experts say there are some aspects of the liberal plan i really like, like the flippers tax, banning of blind bidding, carrot and stick to fight nymbyism in municipalities, the tax credit for the second units in homes and the rent to own. i think all of these could have marginal benefits and rent to own can be very good for those who just can’t afford to save that downpayment.

the problem is no one wants to get to the root of the issue which is housing is being treated as an investment vehicle. people are buying up immense amounts of land because that land skyrockets in value while they’re using it as an airbnb. i know people who own 10 airbnb properties - that’s ten properties that could increase housing supply and are instead being used by parasites who had money to begin with to generate more wealth.

what we need is to
a) completely remove income taxes and replace them with high land value taxes with protections to prevent these taxes just being sloughed down onto renters (say in an apartment building that each apartment can at maximum be x% of the land value tax). it would have to add up to be profitable for investors still, but this way you could stop price gouging as the rent would be intrinsically tied to the value of the property and not whatever the hell landlords feel like charging (see the 109%+ increases coming in the metro halifax area for landlords whose costs absolutely have not changed).

or, the less extreme option

b) scaling purhase and land value tax, payable immediately on the purchase of an additional property and yearly on said property respectively. raise the percentage for each additional property after the first. make it so that hoarding homes is no longer a viable investment. rather then individuals owning dozens of homes we would nudge the market towards single or single digit home ownership, allowing more canadians to afford homes. because owning multiple homes would come with higher taxation investors would be less likely to flock to purchasing properties and the market should cool.


but not even the ndp is proposing anything remotely close to these solutions. hell, i would argue some of the meat of the liberal plan will be more effective at increasing supply and possibly slowing the runaway freight train then my beloved ndps. but not a single party has a plan that will actually deflate the housing market, probably because if they said they wanted to do that home owners across the nation would revolt against them.

also, airbnb’s at minimum should be taxed as high as hotels. probably more since hotels are usually custom built units and airbnb’s are usually family homes taken off the market by parasites.",liberals

this is a small but clear case of \"two-tier healthcare.\"  it was obviously great for you and i don't at all criticize your decision to pay for the mri, but you were only in a position to do so because you could afford the $700 upfront cost.

the first signs i saw sprouted up in the upper middle class suburbs along my bus route a few weeks after the writ dropped. by my count on lawns there were 5 tory 2 liberal. the same area had mostly liberal signs last time and there were way more of them up earlier in the campaign.

the signs along the highway came in batches of lpc-cpc-ndp-ppc (i guess because it saves the hassle of not violating sign bylaws?)

didn't bother to keep count but the cpc were slightly overrepresented and the ndp were significantly underrepresented, especially compared to last time. i've heard them say they're intentionally using fewer signs for environmental reasons which i could believe, but then again that's exactly what i'd say if we had no money or volunteers for signs

my neighbourhood didn't have any signs until recently, but then it's mostly townhouses and apartments full of students, blue collar workers and refugees. i don't remember many political signs here last time either. the first to go up yesterday was a big ppc sign across the street at one of the townhouses. we'll see if any other signs pop up in response.

the only sign of campaigners i've seen was when the cpc left fliers in our mailbox and amy from the conservative party texted if she could count on my support this election day (answer: no). a little surprised the ndp hasn't been through considering in theory it's prime turf for them but the lpc might have it on lockdown in more ways than one.",conservatives

hchrojl,2021-09-11T08:57:43.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - saturday, september 11, 2021 i've explained how parts of it work at various times, but it's a product of 5 or 6 years of tweaking.

first, i considered all elections in which the cpc competed, so anything from 2004 to 2019. then using gis software, i mapped 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2011 results (gut checked by elections canada's own redistribution) to the 2015 maps.

from this, i created a synthetic baseline for each riding using a weighted average of the above results. this kind of creates a fundamental baseline for each riding.

next, i looked at every single public poll from wikipedia federally and provincially and checked to see how accurate and precise they were in picking the winners. this allows me to weigh polls similar to how pj at 338 canada assigns a letter grade to his pollsters. my criteria weren't exactly the same as his, but it produced similar results.

from there, i can create weighted poll averages and calculate them as a swing against the baseline. i apply this swing by region uniformly.

next, i examine the polling across various demographic cross-sections (age, income, education) and then apply additional swings normalized to zero across a given region.

then i make tweaks for turnout against the age cross-section based on elections canada data.

then i apply various manual and editorial tweaks to the individual ridings/candidates. for example, i manually set all greens to 0 in nl, i gave a penalty to the liberals in kit cen, and for the cpc in dartmouth and beaches-east york.

so then after all of that, you can calculate who wins in each riding, and those are the numbers in bold above, or in the \"seats ahead\" column.

after this, you examine the poll errors, and use said poll errors to derive the error in a given region. once you have a poll error for a region, then what you can do is use the [monte carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monte_carlo_method) which allows you to determine the probability of a given party winning a given seat. so for example, if we take a swing riding like [port moody--coquitlam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_moody%e2%80%94coquitlam), we see that it's a three-way race between the major parties, so one would expect that the \"chance of winning\" that riding would be close to 33% each, even though obviously only one party wins it.

so using the monte carlo method, you can create a distribution of seats that looks, sorta, like a normal distribution. this is what it would like for this [current simulation](https://i.imgur.com/fiz4wa1.png) above.

the simulations are not just conducted on a riding by riding basis, but also on a regional basis. the thinking is if say the liberals are doing/saying something to say appeal to brampton, then we should expect all the brampton ridings to move together. in order to decide what these regions should be, i thought that [these ridings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/candidates_of_the_2021_canadian_federal_election) intuitively are grouped. so we can then apply a correlated variation between the various groups.

however, i'm not sure if this is the most effective way to group/correlate the ridings. for example, intuitively, it may make sense for say rural saskatchewan to behave more similarly to rural alberta, and dt vancouver to behave similarly to dt toronto, but there are too many ridings to make that sort of editorial judgement. i'm thinking at some point it will require a more [sophisticated grouping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single-cell_transcriptomics#data_analysis) using something like a k-means clustering, principal component analysis, or t-sne dimensional reduction. however, i, unfortunately, did not have the time this election to work this out. i barely have an undergraduate-level understanding of statistics, and i still have a day job--so no time this time around.

anyway, once we have the probabilities, then we can measure things like a 95% band.

excel also has a nifty mapping tool that i use to generate the maps. 

99% of everything that i did to create the model was done in excel.",liberals

moreover, there is absolutely nothing tonedeaf about an individual being concerned about their own livelihood, and it's kind of untoward to suggest otherwise. atlantic canadian fishers all have a history of being screwed by ottawa they have every right to be worried.    
     
this is especially true when considering the first nation's opinion that \"fishing for them is a privilege, for us it's a right.\" to be clear, given that many communities in ns depend on the fishery, including ethnic minority acadian communities, this is essentially saying that the continued existence of entire multigenerational communities is a mere privilege.

forcing physicians to perform procedures they are not comfortable performing (whether due to inexperience or moral objections) won’t help anybody - it will breed resentment in those physicians and lead to lower standard of care for the patients subject to those procedures. though there is at least one notable exception if the objection is moral alone (i.e., not experience-based): procedures required urgently to prevent serious harm to the patient.",liberals

in the case of abortion, i  think any doctor would admit that an abortion as a life saving intervention to pregnancy complications, is absolutely the moral thing to do, to save the mother, and prevent 2 deaths. any doctor that says otherwise and allows their beliefs to cloud their judgement, and believes the mother should die a preventable death, along with the fetus, absolutely should not practice healthcare anymore. there is no moral excuse for that.

but what is often over looked, is that the majority of abortions are not life saving interventions. so really, in any case other than a life saving measure, what obligation under law, does any doctor have, to perform an abortion and end a potential life.

not everyone can handle cutting apart a baby in the womb, and scraping the peices out. i imagine for many it would be a horrific experience, and they should have every right to choose not to be the one to do it, knowing there is someone else who will. 

it strikes me as similar to anyone elses right to refuse unsafe work, it doesn't need to be done this way, there are other options, and in the end, if this is what it must be, than i'm not doing it, you can find someone else who will.

no, you can't sue a doctor for refusing to perform an abortion based on their moral or religious opposition to abortion. unless you think every provincial medical association is somehow actively breaching the charter as we speak.

you're also asserting *a ton* of suppositions and feelings without any actual evidence -- for that, see below. international smuggling is *still* responsible for the overwhelming majority of violent crime. unsurprisingly, more crime is also responsible for the remainder of the sourcing, which while on the rise, doesn't seem to be translating into homicide (which to be fair i find confusing but if we're sticking to data...).

and to speak to your second point, any altercation could become a gun crime but in washington state for example, there are clearly codified laws that describe when and where you can use lethal force to defend yourself with a gun.

if people were following the laws then there would be no problem. and having a gun is more likely to escalate situations because people feel threatened in the presence of a gun and are more likely to respond with aggression. so even if they only use guns in those situations, simply having a gun makes those situations more likely to occur.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/05/gun-police-public-more-aggressive-psychology-weapons-effect

while i know studies on this are hard to be conclusive about since the fact can be made that gun ownership comes as a response to increases in crime, it seems like attributing the issue to poverty isn't enough. even when controlling for population density, poverty, unemployment, ethnic makeup, and region, the prevalence of firearms is still one of the higher predictors of violent crime across the board.

http://www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/jpj_firearm_ownership.pdf

this study is a bit old, but when accounting for the difference in crime rates between the us and canada, segregation of the poor within cities and the availability of firearms are factors which can account for a lot of the remaining variance.

h7m38n4,2021-08-03T09:19:39.000-07:00,"trudeau’s recent housing announcement for peel filled with misleading claims &gt; npr covered this consulting some economists. 

you do realize that in this conversation they were talking about americans, right?  while we have a number of things in common, we also have some major differences.  we never had white flight for the most part in canada.     

but let's deal with the 3 reasons they offered up anyways.  

1. boomers live longer.  sorry for your luck, but are you really going to blame someone for your misfortune because they didn't die too young?  

2.  boomers, just like every other home owner resist zoning changes, but for some reason you only want to blame boomers, who as i pointed out before, if they want to live in their home, really for the most part, couldn't care less about what it's value is.  they want their homes, and it really doesn't matter if they are worth 5 times or 10 times what they paid for it, as many of them don't want to sell, period.  that aside, as i say my region is undergoing an unprecedented (probably since ww2) building boom.  and it's all boomer or silent generation driven.  hence why the average age in my neighbourhood has increased by a few years, in just a few years.    

but let's get to the real meat of this argument, millenials are the largest demographic, but you decry boomers have all the power?  you belong to the literal largest voting block, and then complain that boomers are too powerful.  seems like you should be looking in the mirror instead of blaming others.  the real answer of course is that homeowners, of which there are a pile of millenials, gen x'ers, boomers and silent generation, all have similar interests in not seeing their home values diminished.  sorry, but your supposed enemy is among your ranks.   

3.  the us housing crisis of 2008.   something that really had minimal impact in canada.  we had a dip in new housing starts that lasted about a year, then returned pretty much to normal.    

&gt;the boomers going to die off within the next 20.    

some will, but my older sister for example who is 56, is likely to live another 30 plus years, statistically speaking.    

&gt;people aren't fleeing the cities,   

actually there are a lot of people leaving the big cities.  they are being replaced by other people moving in, you know, because they sold their homes.  don't believe me, take a look at what has happened to the real estate market in halifax in the last 16 months.  those people aren't moving in from rural areas of nova scotia, they are moving from urban areas in ontario.

&gt;what's you point here? you don't agree that tokyo currently has enough housing units and that is due partly to a different development process which doesn't include consultation? new york also got denser before a consultation process was required.    

do you know anything about japan?  sure they don't have a housing issue.  they also don't have an immigration issue, as they tend not to accept immigrants, period.  are you aware that their population peaked in 2009, and today there are 1.5 million less japanese people than there were just 12 years ago?  but hey if you want to think they did it all through zoning, ..... okay.   

&gt;new york also got denser before a consultation process was required.     

have you ever been to new york?  they have been building sky scrapers there for more than 100 years.  so yeah, their zoning rules are a bit different, mostly because they had to be all these years.  it's not a new pivot for them.  

&gt;i am also gen x who owns a home with only a little bit of a mortgage to go.   

oh, do you have a single detached home with a yard?   if so, why?  you seem to think that everyone in large cities should have to live in apartments, why not you?  isn't that the solution you are going on and on about?  why shouldn't everyone get the single detached home with a yard, driveway and swimming pool in the backyard?  why just some people, others, well they need to live in apartments.  right, can't have too much sprawl.  and while you may well live in a condo, which is fine as far as i'm concerned, i can see myself doing that when i no longer want to have to deal with trimming the hedges, cutting the lawn and shoveling snow, and want to spend my winters somewhere south.   the real problem is the housing crisis is on two fronts.  not enough rental apartments, and not enough people who want to live in apartments.  guess who builders want to build for, someone who will outright buy their product before it's built, or someone who wants to rent a nice apartment, at the cheapest price possible?  that shouldn't be a mystery to anyone.  

&gt;they've *(as in homeowners, according to your npr source)* been doing the nimby for their entire home owning lives; the net effect is cities have under built housing units for longer than both our lives which is major cause of the current problem.    

under built housing units?  you mean apartments, as apparently there are already too many single detached homes, and that's the real problem.  right?  i'm also sure as a homeowner, you certainly don't care about the value of your home right?  maybe your neighbourhood should be tore down to build huge apartment towers, or is it better if it's someone else's neighbourhood?   i'm not trying to be flip here, it's a very serious question.  who should make the sacrifice?",liberals

i forget which columnist -- i don't even think they were a liberal, necessarily, i think they worked for postmedia -- referred to the snc drama as the media (his colleagues) having trump envy. nothing of that gravity ever came up in trudeau's tenure so they made a big deal of that because they were jealous of how the american news got skyrocketing ratings from covering the impeachment trial.

more so it's clinton envy, as the cpc have seen how productive the gqp have been tearing apart democrats and running them out of office on a rail by inflating nothingburger nontroversies into nuremberg trials. they seek to capture the same magic on trudeau. we-ghazi and now this dud are just the latest examples of trying to mimic republican scandal mongering because just like their cousins to the south, they have no policies that the majority of the electorate can support, so their only hope is to smear their opponents with negative coverage and hope that voters respond by voting the bums out.",liberals
git4lps,2021-01-10T06:43:01.000-08:00,"trumpism in canada? erin o'toole be thy name might be filling in some blanks on your own there. never said you're evil, and never thought it. but you don't have to be evil to have a belief worth opposing. also not trying to talk down to you. i just made the point that to support someone who would endanger democratic institutions, even in support of your other values, is a choice that people who want to remain living in a democracy should avoid. and actively work against. 

i'm not sure how that's \"talking down\" to you. and its certainly far less \"talking down\" than these faux questions and insincere \"what ifs\". \"crazy concept\". \"brainwashed\". come on, if don't intend to be concern trolling, that's how its coming across. how can you even suggest i'm not being civil while using language like that.

i also am one of the people who strongly believes that the us's democratic institutions can withstand a bad president. but we also know that democracy worldwide is declining, and that democracy takes active effort to maintain. we know that polarization and disinformation harm democratic institutions, especially when combined, and that with enough time, those will destroy a democracy. just look at the republican leadership. i was a strong believer that the republican leadership, along with a strong civil service, would restrain trump's worst impulses. instead many in the party leadership backed his disinformation, defended his failure to fill key posts in critical departments like state and defence, and denied his very vocal anti-democratic tendencies. that's the republican party, the country's bastion of constitutionalism. and it took literally a mob storming the capitol for opposition within the party to pick up steam.

you're right, and in many if not most cases i'd agree with you. the personality of the president shouldn't outweigh policy. you can't predict the future. but trump made no secret of his disdain for democracy. he wasn't exactly hiding his willingness to act in ways dangerous to american institutions. he literally campaigned on it. and when critics pointed that out, his moderate defenders either said that he was being misinterpreted, or that the institutions would restrain him. 

and on that latter point, barring something exceptional, his defenders were right. he has committed to a transition. but not before an doing substantial damage to both us institutions, its alliances, and the republican party. and as mentioned, his aims were apparent beforehand. this is clearly not someone suited to the presidency. and if you know the powers of the office, and are willing to back him anyway, that's dangerous for democracy. doing so is basically rolling the dice. even if they're weighted in the favor of democracy, it's still a great risk.

since you brought it up, at least clinton didn't have those openly anti-democratic attitudes. and what war? iran? she was in favor of the jcpoa. clearly the better choice to avoid war with there. china? even barring the reality that as a longtime politician she clearly was concerned with avoiding a major power conflict, she clearly had the less belligerent stance of the two on beijing. russia? where? ukraine had already frozen, and the us had pretty much set its course in syria by 2016 as anti-isis and not much else. again ignoring that mad is obviously a strong deterrent to a hawk like her. so what does that leave? north korea or venezuela? the first remains exceedingly unlikely given the nuclear and conventional threat to south korea and japan, and covert means would clearly be a better option for the second. afghanistan? maybe extended and the flagging peace process not well backed? but for that (and frankly for many of there) you'd have to ignore the one thing that makes clinton as a candidate stand out: she listens to expert advice. and the overwhelming expert consensus on afghanistan between 2014-20 was that it wasn't worth it to continue.

you're right. we can't predict the future. and we couldn't in 2016. but it seems to me a hawk who listens to departmental advice is a clearly better choice than someone unpredictable who's only clear foreign policy positions were anti-nato, anti-china, anti-iran even back then. (and who ended up not even filling many key state and dod positions, and well as disparaging and ignoring the intelligence community).

but again, the foreign policy discussion is irrelevant, because the big standout thing for clinton is she didn't vocally position herself as someone who would undermine american institutions. trump did. and its always worth opposing that, even if he's unlikely to succeed.

because again, democracy takes active work to maintain. and for people who want to continue living in a democracy, it's not worth rolling the dice on a clearly risky candidate, because even if the institutions win (as they probably would),  they will come out damaged and less able to deal with the next threat.",conservatives

&gt; the ar-15 assault rifle was engineered to create what one of its designers called “maximum wound effect.” its tiny bullets – needle-nosed and weighing less than four grams – travel nearly three times the speed of sound. as the bullet strikes the body, the payload of kinetic energy rips open a cavity inside the flesh – essentially inert space – which collapses back on itself, destroying inelastic tissue, including nerves, blood vessels and vital organs. “it’s a perfect killing machine,” says dr. peter rhee, a leading trauma surgeon and retired captain with 24 years of active-duty service in the navy.

&gt; the mass-market boom of the ar has been horrific for the rest of us. adam lanza stormed sandy hook elementary with a bushmaster ar-15, laying down more than 150 rounds in less than five minutes and slaughtering 20 first-graders. james holmes wielded a smith &amp; wesson “military &amp; police” (m&amp;p) ar-15 fitted with a 100-round drum magazine in his siege of a movie theater that killed 12 and wounded 58. the san bernardino, california, shooters carried a pair of ar-15s in their isis-inspired rampage that left 14 dead. orlando shooter omar mateen deployed sig sauer’s concealable “next-generation ar” to murder 49 and injure dozens more at the pulse nightclub – the deadliest mass shooting in modern american history.

&gt; “time and time again we see it used to do what it was designed to do, which is to kill a lot of people in a short amount of time,” says mark barden, managing director of the sandy hook promise, a group dedicated to protecting children from gun violence. barden’s son daniel – precocious, kindhearted, an ace at foosball – was one of the students murdered in newtown, connecticut. “it’s designed for combat,” he says. “it doesn’t have any practical application in civilized society.”

i think there was some scrutiny early last week but not much.

the other attempts at wedge issues and big differences weren't gaining too much traction outside of a couple articles here and there. this gun control issue is probably the first real big focus that took multiple days out of otooles sails whereas in the lead up, it was always lpc bad, or lpc failing, or \"antivaxxers a problem\". 

i don't know that guns is the big decider this election frankly, but it's certainly the first weak point in the cpc campaign. and otoole has very quickly sought to try and turn that around. though perhaps too quick. 

now that this issue exists, it might be easier for his opponents to start poking away at \"what else are you willing to say to avoid criticism\" angle, and other such things. it also puts him on the backdoor headed into the debates. and honestly, it doesn't need to be a giant issue like childcare to spark a wedge. anything that gets people thinking and forces a response is sufficient. and given how hard otoole has decided to bite, who knows what the next week will look like. if he stays on the defensive then the debates are going to be very interesting.",conservatives

&gt;but instead of that money going into direct rebates for canadian households, as is the case currently, the conservatives would divert revenues to a \"personal low carbon savings account.

&gt;\"consumers could then draw on those accounts for \"things that help them live a greener life,\" the document says. \"that could mean buying a transit pass or a bicycle, or saving up and putting the money towards a new efficient furnace, energy efficient windows or even an electric vehicle.\"

&gt;the conservative party's carbon price for the savings account would increase over time to reach a maximum of $50 per tonne. but it would go no higher than that, according to the plan.

so after all this time spent criticizing the carbon price as being useless, etc, he will have one that is less effective while controlling what people can spend their rebate on.

i don't think this is a fair comparison. yes he is stipulating that it be spent in a specific sector, but that money is being spent by the individuals, not the government. he's saying that the 10% that does not go into current rebates and can theoretically go anywhere, will instead be combined with the 90% that goes into rebates, creating the theoretical full amount, and be put directly into the savings account allowing the individual to choose what they want to make go green in their life.

okay, but what about families and low income individuals who use the rebate to buy groceries or pay expenses? part of the benefit of the rebate is to offset costs.

imo people should have the choice of what they spend it on. those who are well off can save it to buy greener technology  if they wish. others may prefer or need to use it for other things.

conservatives are usually big on choice and personal responsibility so i'm actually very surprised to see this type of method from o'toole. i'm also surprised he hasn't considered how low income individuals could be negatively impacted. that was often the reason he would criticize the carbon tax (while disingenuously not mentioning the rebate of course) so for him to come out with a plan that could hurt them more seems shortsighted on his part.

a carbon tax is going to alienate all their supporters who bought into their own rhetoric about a \"job killing carbon tax.\" it will probably alienate the free market types as well, since this saving plan idea sounds like it has the government setting up winners and losers, by dictating what purchases can be made with this savings account. the bureaucracy needed to vet the purchases will also be a problem for the cpc base. finally, for those who want an effective climate change plan, capping the price of carbon at $50/ton, is a joke, as that is well below the price required to reverse emissions.

he literally said \"creating more red tape (savings account) is a weird way to improve the program\". that's why i mentioned and clarified to make sure the \"red tape\" he was talking about was the saving account, then i went on to talk about the policy as he did. now this is being pedantic is.",conservatives

yeah, maybe it can be turned around, but i find it harder to see.  the attack would be pretty nakedly exploiting dead kids for political gain, which could backfire (i think you'd need \"surrogates\" to push it at all), and i suspect o'toole could (probably) keep the damage fairly low because he could still say it's a great tragedy/crime, attack the libs as not doing enough ... it takes a little finesse, but not a ton, and i think the attack will mostly appeal to people who'd never, ever vote for the conservatives anyhow.",conservatives
