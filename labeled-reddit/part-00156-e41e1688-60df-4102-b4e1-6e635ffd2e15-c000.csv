&gt; canada's constitutional convention dealing with minority governments was altered in 1968 when pearson's government was unexpectedly defeated on a matter of confidence. while this should have led to an immediate dissolution of parliament, none of the parties were ready, and pearson was in the process of being replaced as leader of the liberals. by mutual agreement among the party leaders, a new motion was passed that retroactively declared that the budgetary matter on which the government was defeated was not a matter of confidence, setting a new precedent.

the next year, a [progressive mp](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_william_bird) fell asleep during debate, woke up suddenly and forgot he was paired with a liberal mp, and voted against the meighen government, triggering the 1926 election.

it is because the chinese have build an entire industrial ecosystem, where the base materials are basically operated at non profit levels - ie, their steel mills, the companies that make just washers, lug nuts, etc. are all run in such a way that they are basically non profits ( when they sell to domestic consumers that is. they reap profit when its for the foreign export market).   
this enables their consumer goods industry to operate at much lower materials cost, because the millions of washers and lug nuts, hunks of steel etc. they are buying to make washing machines and iphones and car parts - they are coming in at 10-15% cheaper than the for-profit model of the western supplier ecosystem. thus they can charge 10% less than we can and still make a profit.

i gave you my opinion. if you don't want to respond to it, then that is your choice. but never say that i didn't posit my arguments, because i did and thus far your only rebuttal is to deny.

&gt;so trudeau shut down the borders with the united states for travellers ; does that make him anti-immigrant? judging by your own rhetoric the answer would be yes.

it means, i'm right. trudeau had no problem doing it. why does ford not make a formal request then? isn't that what he wants?

but once again, tell me i'm wrong. i find it a little strange that doug ford would throw his tantrums, but not actually want to go through with them.  it's purely a political strategy, and it is about framing international travelers, and immigrants as the \"plague ridden foreigners that are bringing disease\" while also crying about the federal government that is letting them in. he and his party are in a desperate situation and they are doing this to rile up their base. it's been done a thousand times, and i am under no illusions that it is beyond a man like doug ford. getting people killed in the name of profit certainly wasn't, so why would he be afraid of blaming outsiders? are you going to tell me trudeau is at fault for the ltc homes too? 

i said my piece, if you want to call it a \"rant\" go ahead. it seems to me more like you don't want to address it. the pointless downvoting pretty much confirms that too. you're all too happy to press the button that \"hides the bad things\".

leftism is about solidarity, the rich exploit and divide the poor.  i'm not creating an enemy here, this is what happens.  step down from your place of privilege and realize that liberalism and conservatism aren't good for the working class.  the current divide has been primarily among race when it should be by class.  who's doing is that?  the upper class distracting us from their shadiness.

&gt;those are oversimplified explanations

i know, i'm not going to write a full essay on how the top 1% controls everything, that would take too long.  the fact if the matter is though, neoliberalism doesn't help the working class.  trump won via tapping into the frustration and lost jobs caused by neoliberalism and globalization.

&gt;pero porfavor, continue, expliqueme porque mi pais anterior es pobre. ignore los hechos como muchos de ustedes les gusta hacerlo.

what country are you from?  i'm assuming latin america because of the spanish?  the corruption happens because of the exploitation, they feed off each other.  the us has a long history of messing around in latin america to further their imperialist agenda.  they literally installed fascist dictators in return for favorable business deals which let them exploit the people and resources.  yes socialist leaders can be corrupt too, we've seen this, but if we break it down to just what the ideologies represent atleast socialism values people over profit.  i've written a paper on us involvement in latin america so i'm not completely clueless on the topic.

hopefully i translated that right my spanish is pretty rusty and i'm not comfortable writing in it.

&gt;yes, everyone except you is an enemy. this is the same story as always.

i could quote mlk saying that white liberals were the most dangerous to the civil rights movement or something along those lines.  bipoc activists have been saying this for years.  maybe try engaging with what i'm actually saying instead of brushing it off.

&gt;alone can fix it. -donald trump

see my previous point, but do you actually want to engage with what i'm saying??  context matters and i'm not saying anything objectively wrong here, leftism is the only ideology being realistic about the nature of the changes we need to make.

trump tapped into the insecurities of the white working class, rural people have been consistently losing their factory jobs, but not because of foreign countries, it was the us leading the charge of globalization and neoliberalism which lead to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the us.  as much as an idiot as he was, we can learn things from him.


&gt;you can't convince people because your solutions don't work. you live in a world of absolutes, people don't like this. and things in the world are not absolute, most things are nuanced.

academia suggests otherwise, did you miss the point about the solutions making people uncomfy?  for example the \"tough on crime\" approach to criminal justice doesn't reduce crimes committed.  that's what the research says, academia has agreed on this, yet politicians continue to advocate for it despite it making the problems worse.  why?  because being tough on crime sounds good and gets votes.  if they actually listened to criminologists and implemented restorative justice and tackled the root causes of crime (which is generally poverty or mental illness which is more common and severe when in poverty). 

the solutions are there, it just requires us to be intersectional and critical of ourselves and our role in being complicit in these systems.  the solutions are nuanced, the issues are nuanced, i've never said otherwise.  the absolute is still there though, we have problems and the people in power benefit from creating those problems.

&gt;if the left could have solved every single problem, it would have done so already. 

see my previous comments about american imperialism.  if europe decided not to colonize the world and erase diverse cultures and ways of life perhaps things would be different.  i think we have different definitions for the left, i'm referring to leftists which are more radical than the mainstream left.  jagmeet and bernie talk about important issues but the system won't let them accomplish meaningful change, and i don't even think they're radical enough to sponsor the change needed.

an extremely simplified answer would be, leftists succeeding would be bad for profits.

&gt;oh, yeah? how? i don't think economics supports anything, it's not like a person or something that takes sides.

so based off of your previous comments you'd rather listen to people's interpretation of something that is inherently neutral??  why even have this conversation then.  regardless it's a measurable thing and people's interpretations of it can be wrong.  it's well established that trickle down economics doesn't work, and socialist governments have repeatedly raised measurable things such as literacy rates and the standard of living.

&gt;the very fact that you have answered this way to what is little more than a simple disagreement shows this

you said you'd rather listen to economists than sociologists, that gives off the impression that you value money over people.  i disagree more than a little with that stance, in fact i find it morally disgusting.  if i've interpreted it wrong, why else would you choose to listen to people who analyze past economies over people who actually study society and it's issues?",liberals

&gt; political parties had emerged in the nineteenth century with the development of representative democracies. ... in order for parties to be effective they had to stand for something - distinctive ideas, recognizable interests - so that electoral competition between them would offer voters meaningful choices. thus, in most democratic societies, parties usually appeared to reflect the prevailing lines of social and economic division: labour parties, catholic parties, bourgeois parties, farmers' parties, linguistic parties, regional parties all ordered political debate and structured electoral competition. to siegfried's surprise, canadian parties rejected any such \"natural form\"....
&gt; 
&gt; ... he argued that they had developed their unnatural form because the country's politicians recognized that, as a country, canada was so inherently fragile that its continuing political existence was at stake. the \"violent oppositions\" that existed between french and english, protestant and catholic, centre and periphery all threatened to pull the country apart, and so national party politicians actively worked to prevent the formation of parties that would represent their individual and distinctive claims. for canadian politicians there could be no appeal to natural constituencies for fear such parties would threaten the stability and very existence of the country (as the emergence of the parti quebecois and the bloc quebecois seventy years later would prove). instead, canadian parties were induced to reject appeals to definitive principles, or specific interests, and were reduced to seeking electoral support wherever, and from whomever, it might be found. the result was an unnatural form of electoral competition in which parties were forced to exist as \"big tents\" - shapeless, heterogeneous coalitions based on continual and shifting compromise.

coyne may want a conservative party that's more than \"liberal lite,\" but there's good reasons why the conservatives are pulled in this direction. if they stick to an ideological position, they're going to find it hard to win federal elections.",conservatives

in the very beginning canada was divided, with many not wanting confederation — the only place that had an election on it (new brunswick) voted against it.

just to pick out some notable divisions of many..

we had the two conscription crises.

in the 1920s there were brutal battles between liberal and conservatives over everything from alcohol to lumber prices to ... wait for it ... vaccines 

there were of course the two quebec referendums and all that entailed.

politicians used to buy votes with bribes of alcohol and cash

the first elections after the loyalists arrival were marked by riots after allegedly being stolen by establishment politicians after the more modernization minded loyalist candidates were defeated.

the kkk was highly organized and attempted —likely with some success— to violently interfere with elections in the 1920s and 30s across the country.

and for the longest time the news itself was partisan, with there being liberal and conservative partisan newspapers. the very idea of independent non-partisan news is less than a century old.

so we’ve always been divided politically. and our current divisions, while noteworthy, are certainly not the worst we’ve ever had. if anything the current hyper partisan atmosphere seems to be something that every generation before the boomers would recognize.

that’s just been on my mind.

h5hhrix,2021-07-16T15:14:04.000-07:00,"federal politics: pre-writ period shows narrow gap between incumbent liberals and cpc challengers while it's true that 1 out of 20 polls will be outside of these values, it's wrong to think that 1 out of 20 polls would be far outside of these values, only that we can be certain that the true value is going to be between the +/- of the poll. 

to use an abstract example; if you have a mean of 33, and a stdev of 2, the real value would be between 29 and 37, 19 times out of 20. but it's also true that 9973 times out of 1000, the true value will be between 27 and 39%. and it's also true that roughly 2/3s of the time, the true value is going to be within one standard deviation of the mean, or 31 to 35%. to put this another way, it's true that 95% of the time, the true value is between 29 and 37 *but* it is not the case that any value within that range has an equal probability of being true. the closer you get to these boundaries, the less probable that result is. (i should make it clear i mean relatively less probable)

the problem with the polling right now is that we're essentially seeing too clusters of polls that disagree with one another quite a bit. my comment is more making the observation that a *true* outlier isn't impossible to get (although i should say the actual definition of an outlier statistically would be outside of the 99.73% range), but to get it repeatedly would be very improbable; if you have 1/20 chance to get an a result that's outside of the margin of error, then you should end up jumping back into it with the next poll. to get it twice would be a 1/400 chance. to get it three times would be 1/8000, and so on. since this is unlikely, the logical conclusion is that at some level, something is going wrong with the methodology and therefore the reason the poll differs so much is because they're (for example) not taking a truly random sample of the population.",liberals

i'm not sure if this one is being held up because of genuine debate and deliberation, or just being stalled by social conservatives. either way, it's arduously long and if this isn't passed by the house by late june, it will have to wait until after a summer break. i *think* there's a provision to continue debates on a bill from the last parliament if there's an election and a new parliament, but i'm honestly not sure if that's the case.",conservatives

no, we don't. in fact most of them have been pretty good. especially considering health care is a provincial service. the fact they haven't perhaps done everything you might have wanted them to is in no way shape or form an sign that they were \"unkind\". healthcare has done very well in canada as a whole. 

they could have done more, sure - but then other priorities would have had to take a back seat. the gov't can only do so much in any given session. you'll note that in the states where the gov't does next to nothing they have a number of facilities. (well - the gov't did help out with the development of the pfizer and moderna vaccine, but the factories were already there)

and at the end of the day the failure of such things as the protections for nursing homes and such is not federal. nor should it be. 

there is no system that is perfect. and we shouldn't judge our system to be a failure just because one got past the goalie this time. but - while provincial gov'ts will have to answer for their own health systems, the feds were entirely responsible for the vaccine procurement, and they will have to answer for their decisions there. 

&gt;i agree that trudeau needs to own not having the vaccine capacity while recognizing hindsight is 2020 and that it can be difficult to build up these assets.

thank you. and we can have a discussion about whether or not that choice was a bad choice or if every choice he faced was a gamble and this is just a gamble that didn't pay off. an argument might be made either way.

i have absolutely zero evidence for this, but this is my favorite election conspiracy theory.  it's well-known that poilievre wants to be cpc leader, so what better way to guarantee the opportunity than to ensure that o'toole underperforms in the next election?

of course, you can't do this openly.  coming out and saying bad things about o'toole would look like an obvious backstab, and leaders-to-be don't openly go against the party.  likewise, engendering an ideological split could damage the party's fortunes beyond poilievre's ability to repair.

but simple \"tactical\" errors that just look like be product of an inept campaign?  that's fair game.  a new leader would bring in his or her own staff, so they could make a strong argument that an adult would be running the show.  in addition, running a clearly substandard campaign would bolster an argument that o'toole should go even if the election returns another lpc minority, in the same way that scheer lost his grip on the party despite increasing both the seat count and popular vote share.

you can also draw an immediate contrast between this cpc ad and poilievre's [own personal ads](https://www.hilltimes.com/2021/08/11/mp-pierre-poilievre-builds-personal-campaign-message-with-debut-campaign-ad-says-political-marketer/311015) (linked for reference, details not that important) running in the ottawa area.  the latter are genuinely slick and deliver a reasonable-sounding message, and they're certainly not the amateurish meme-bait of this ad under discussion.",conservatives

h8xi9yl,2021-08-14T03:06:19.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] this was talked about all year... trudeau touts sept goal for all canadians to be vaccinated, everyone is supposed to be liking trudeau for meeting that goal. ideal situation was we are all so impressed that we are prepared for an election and cleanly re-elect the liberals to a majority in the same way the bc ndp did last year (which btw many people including myself are already regretting voting for them). 

that's not the case. yes people are being vaxxed but with a 4th wave looming, crisis out west with forest fires, it being mid summer, etc. people are just focused on other stuff, i think this will be a very low turnout election and no one will care. i think it's possible the polls are even wrong and because of the low turnout, we see a stupidly strong ndp that in turn splits the left vote and we get a cpc gov and a cpc minority.",liberals

h8xifak,2021-08-14T03:07:23.000-07:00,"liberal, ndp candidates must be fully vaccinated to run for election - conservative, green, bloc québécois recommend but don't require shots for their candidates right now, we are on the climb out of the most significant events in this country in the last few decades, but that event is by no means over. we are, realistically speaking, going to have to deal with it for a while yet.

it is obvious, then, that how politicians would act towards this is pertinent information when you are on the eve of voting for said politicians. if someone is not going to vaccinate themself, how could you rely on that person to combat vaccine hesitancy? as more variants occur, the risk of a vaccine losing effectivity and requiring booster shots increases. if this were to occur, we would need our leadership to lead. having people unwilling to even vaccinate themselves leading an effort to get everyone vaccinated? it's an absurdity.

the liberals are also not at fault for turning this into a political issue. the inability for the opposing parties to do what is necessary and lead, however, makes it one that everyone should consider in the upcoming election.",liberals
