so the choice for quebec is largely to teach more fsl and require it, or to reduce immigration and shrink quebec's population over time.  reasonably, quebec will choose option a.  but in the meantime there will be more esl immigrants coming from asia to montreal.  so montreal, which absorbs 76% of quebec's recent immigrant population, will continue being a source of strife for those concerned with this issue in quebec.

over time i suspect the majority of esl-only or no english or french immigrants in quebec will learn french, and will then be able to spread to other parts of quebec more ably.  so montreal isn't the de-facto immigrant city of quebec. (although i expect the majority to remain in montreal, sure.)  i don't think there's any change to this reality, trudeau or otherwise.

it's much the same issue for our other immigration hubs toronto and vancouver.  the time scale for language adoption is longer than our political cycle, certainly.  the acceleration of our immigration numbers recently will put more stress on this issue though.  esp. if they possess neither english nor french.  imho 20% is too high for that.

i'm willing to bet, the latter make up less than 1% of vehicles on the road. so, take 5.2 and divide by 100, so now we have 0.052 deaths/100,000 attributed to luxury sportscars.  now, even if i'm being ridiculously generous and say that sports cars make up 10% of the vehicles on the road, that's still 0.52 deaths per 100,000.",conservatives

here's how it works:  they enjoy early support in general opinion polls across the land, because they're usually the first party to come up with a platform that the public can accept.  then, usually in the last few weeks, one or two of their more 'traditional' candidates will bring up an issue that the public is sick of hearing about.  abortion, gay marriage, or whatever else... all it takes is one candidate to shoot the whole party in the foot with a tweet or a comment that goes viral.",conservatives

i left a nurse manager job in which i was responsible for 500+ employees and the psw care of thousands of vulnerable patients in the gta. after covid-19 hit, i was expected to be on-call 24/7 to my boss, to public health, to the lhins, to our employees with covid-19 questions and concerns, etc. my working day went from 0830-1630 to 0700- ????.

the real kicker came when i found out that i could make more money doing temp work in local ltcs passing out meds and putting on bandages than i was doing my demanding, 24/7 manager job. so i quit. and i've been making between $40 - 60/hour for my time since then. this is less than many icu nurses are making right now to do the hardest jobs in healthcare. 

more and more nurses are walking away from their full time jobs. why sign your life over to a hospital and a government that doesn't give a shit about you? it's not just the wage freezes, it's the cancelled vacations, the mandatory black out dates, the forced overtime, the constant short-staffing, and the unsafe patient ratios. there's no reason to be a nurse anymore. no one respects us, no one values us, and no one is interested in paying us what we're worth. 

conservative governments are trying to break your healthcare system so they can force through 2-tier. and if they do that, guess which tier you'll be on? and guess what type of services and staffing you'll get there? a vote for the conservatives is a vote against nurses and healthcare. and one day, you're going to need us.",conservatives

hg2i7yb,2021-10-09T14:53:36.000-07:00,"gunter: look closely, trudeau's 'mandatory' vax policy isn't what it seems just talk to any federal public servant and it makes sense.

hell anyone who understands the public service.

they can only make rules for departments in \"the core public administration\" because treasury board is the employer for them. treasury board is the only cabinet committee in legislation. the financial administration act that creates treasury board also defines the federal departments it is in charge of and employer for in two schedules. agencies and crown corps outside the defined tb 'controlled' schedules are employers in their own right - cra for example is its own arm of government and while it has a minister is it's own employer so all rules and terms and conditions of employment are written by itself not tbs (the administrative public service department that serves tb the committee.

for the government to make rules for every federally regulated workplace they aren't the direct employer for through cabinet via tb, they need tb to pass regulations. since cabinet hasnt been reformed yet, and they aren't sworn in then tb isn't meeting and can't set rules for anyone they don't employ.

and even if they set rules via regulations the employers need to decide how to comply themselves.

ok! there's why only some departments (representing the vast majority of federal public servants mind you) are covered and others aren't.

oh and if anyone says service canada is exempt - they aren't. they're a part of employment and social development canada which is a core administration department where tb is the employer. they just aren't on a list of departments because they aren't one their a part of another. ctv was reporting this incorrectly last week.

step 2: why an attestation?

well i don't know the actual details but i'm gonna make some educated guesses.

first, an attestation is fast. it's easy to implement and it will let them move quick on this issue. it was 3 clicks for me for example.

two, it's a legal thing and an attestation is a big deal in the ps. see getting fired is rare because most people are good at their jobs and most people have protections to keep them from getting fired by shitty bosses and to provide some protection to push back against arbitrary or harmful political direction that breaks laws and rules. and it also means training is supposed to help people doing poorly vs recruiting new people etc etc. 

now why does that matter? unions = job security for better or worse we all know that. there are some sacred cows we can't kill in the public service. shit that fucks with security clearance and things that break the values and ethics code are up there. when that happens unions can do little to help you and your job is at serious risk. the unions can grieve and push back on a person's individual right to choose not to be vaccinated. that's a legal argument citing the charter it will take time to process etc. meanwhile under grievance the person keeps working.

what the union can't protect someone on nearly as easily is lying on an attestation form. and i think that might be part of why this route was taken. it forces people to tell the truth because if they lie they're in serious jeopardy. very serious. they could lose their jobs over it. 

but how will they check? it was explained at the press conference that departments would audit to see if the attestations were valid. and the policy on the mandated vaccines goes so far as to say the deputy ministers, effectively ceo's of departments, could lose their authority if they don't comply. saying a deputy minister can have their authority revoked (effectively firing them as no authority = no job) is something i've not seen said so plainly in policy before.

so adding it all up it's actually quite strict. would it be easier to get records from provinces? sure. do the feds have info sharing agreements with the provinces for health info though? nope. so back to point 1, this attestation is the fastest simplest solution 
 
again to clarify *i don't have any knowledge of the actual decision or discussions surrounding it* before anyone thinks i do. i also don't have much of an opinion on the ultimate final approach and if i did it wouldn't be public anyway. i just know acting like this isn't a big deal cuz it's an attestation form ignores massive public service context. and acting like there's gaps in coverage across federal departments implies that the writer doesn't understand the nuance of the public service and it's myriad employers in the legal sense.",liberals

so none of your reasons actually apply. canada post union isn't the issue. the canpost is just its own employer.

i arrived at my hypothesis by having a well-founded belief that when it appears government policy makes absolutely no sense, it is overwhelming likely that there is actually a totally reasonable explanation that hasn't been considered. 

my problem is that when journalists make the assertion that a policy is problematic, they really ought to do the rudimentary research needed to support their assertion. but here, gunter just claims that the policy is hiding something and is shitty, when it is in fact literally the most that the government can do at the present time. and if he had bothered to act remotely like a journalist, he'd have found out this info before writing that excuse for an opinion piece. instead, he exposed himself to be someone willing to write an authoritative sounding opinion piece based on obviously incomplete information. 

i don't know if gunter is simply too ignorant to realize he's missing information required for a reasonable person to arrive at his conclusion, or if he saw the gap and deliberate didn't bother to inform himself, or if he is well-informed and decided to omit the facts that challenged his thesis. but i think it has to be one of those three things, and none of them are a good look. he is pathetic, and so is his editor.

further, i don't think the unions will win at all on this, nor do i think they want to. (similarly, i am aware that the caf is very pro vax, and definitely don't need a policy from the pm to make their own rules.) but the risk of job action in specific unions still needs to be accounted for when making new rules like this, in terms of its likelihood as well as its impact.",liberals

example: 

&gt; the crisis broke out in the summer of 2007, following the electoral victory of the alliance of the flemish christian democrats and the new flemish alliance, who supported a wide-reaching state reform and the immediate split of bhv. after 194 days of often heated negotiations, parties finally succeeded in forming a new government. in december 2008, another crisis related to the fortis case, erupted, again destabilising the country and resulting in the resignation of belgian prime minister yves leterme. the new herman van rompuy-led government brought a brief period of fragile stability, but ended when van rompuy left his office to become the first full-term president of the european council. the succeeding leterme ii government fell in april 2010 over the lack of progress on resolving the bhv issue. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%e2%80%932011_belgian_political_crisis

belgium went four years with only two elections, as we normally would, but they did not have stable government during that time in their closely-divided, proportional representation parliament

&gt; belgium has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

historically, there have always been moments in history when some technological innovation wiped out an entire trade or labour sector. in recent memory, [type setters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_typographical_union) are a good example of this. [the luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luddite) are another famous example of this phenomenon.

but the economy was always able to absorb these displaced workers into new jobs.

it's not clear that this will be possible when true robotic automation becomes viable.

this is often cited as the justification for universal basic income.

personally, i prefer milton freedman's idea about [negative income tax](https://youtu.be/xtpgkx588nm) because it does not remove the incentive to work.

this is too far down the road to be part of the current ppc platform but bernier is the only federal party leader i know who is versed in fundamental economic theory, understands the difference between keynesian and the austrian school of economics and is able to quote the relevant thought leaders in the field.

i think we'll probably hit about 72% of the total population (82% of 12+) with the currently approved vaccines, and j&amp;j will boost that by a couple percent. i hope i'm wrong and it's in the 90s but i've lost a lot of faith in humanity over the past year and a bit.",liberals
