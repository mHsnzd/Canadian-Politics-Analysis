here, the car is just so easy to use. even in québec with our \"high\" gas prices, its cheaper to have two people in a car than to use any other method. furthermore, once i get where i'm going in north america, the car will almost always be the best and cheapest option as parking isn't too hard or expensive and its usually faster if i'm not doing something directly downtown. gas in france averages at $2.20/l and about $1.10 here, driving is going to probably be cheaper in the end (at face value) and probably be faster. look at marseille's transit vs quebec city or windsor, you could be fine without a car there. the only comparison here would be acela in the us. even then, the population of the megalopolis is 52 million over a similar distance compared to our 20ish. even then, the acela is quite poor in terms of hsr.

which brings me to my next point, the history. usually countries with high speed rail have a history of a big rail system, and they may usually own the land before construction. here, via owns very little so the overall cost will be insane. furthermore, it seems like even paris-marseille still has a minimum of 2x the density of qc-windsor (wikipedia shows a minimum of 160/km2 in the regions between, we have 82/km2 overall). additionally, these railways own all (or nearly) the tracks and run all the train service in the country (including local) and as such can usually do things on economies of scale. we have different agencies doing all of this in different places.

so here's the thing, we could theoretically build this hsr in the corridor and maybe it will work, but as i said in the previous comment until we can improve municipal transit, your only customer will be business travel. in a post pandemic world, it may be a much smaller group than before so that's a very risky proposition financially. furthermore, if the goal is to get the most benefit (i.e change the most lives per dollar) local transit improvements help way more people for the same cost and help us reach climate goals later on. that's why via will do as much as it can to speed up the travel times, but wont star on hsr until not using a car in a city becomes the de facto practice.

tl:dr: car is cheaper and faster, rail companies and infrastructure is problematic, that money is arguably much better spent locally first.",liberals

gkwfhrw,2021-01-26T10:18:31.000-08:00,"o’toole: trudeau in ‘conflict’ picking next governor general without consulting opposition parties &gt;i am about to ask this question with no ill-will and in good faith because i genuinely do not understand:

i shall treat it as such. 

&gt;why is it a conflict of interest? our gg is a ceremonial figurehead

well no, the gg is absolutely not. so good question - the answer requires understanding what the gg is for. 

the gg is actually the circuit breaker of our democracy. i'll explain that in a minute - but the important thing right now is that like most circuit breakers 99 percent of the time there's no problem with the circuit. so you might be forgiven for thinking that it was a completely unnecessary component. most homes may go decades without throwing a breaker or experiencing a dangerous situation - so someone might eventually forget that those breakers are there or what they are for. and that's why many think it's cerimonaial. it's not. 

remember - the prime minister cannot dissolve parliament. only the gg can. and nobody can form gov't without the gg's say so. the gg actually has the power to just up and say 'screw it, the ndp are forming gov't\".  

i bet you didn't know they had that power - but they are literally that powerful. 

now - by tradition and understanding the gg follows some set traditions. for example, if one party forms the majority in the house then she grants that party the right to form gov't.  and - if there is a minority gov't - the gg gets to decide who gets first crack at forming gov\"t as well. 

think about that for a minute. what if you were a minority party and you wanted to try to form gov't, you might not even be the largest minority - but you might still be given the chance if the gg decides it''s best.  so... how might that be a bit of a conflict if you also happen to be the person who chose the gg? 

you can see where it's going right?

there have been several times in our history when the gg stepped in to prevent political abuses. parties try to manipulate the system to force an election - the gg stopped them. if a party were to try to trigger an election shortly after the last one because they think the other guy is out of money - the gg can stop that and by tradition would.  if a gov't is trying to force an election while other parties think they could lead - the gg can stop them and give the other parties a chance. 

this prevents a lot of the kind of games that political parties can pull to subvert the democratic process. there are other examples as well. the gg is necessary and really only plays a critical role if there's a minority situation - but there is a real chance of that in the next eleciton. and justin, who may have a minority gov't, is picking the person by himself? of  course that's a conflict. that's like picking and paying the judge at your trial. 

so you can see why it's important that the gg be someone who all parties can accept. otherwise it undermines our democracy. look to the south to see what happens when people lose faith in their democracy.",liberals

2) no help at all was clearly incorrect/poor choice of wording, my apologies. what i meant to say was far less help. in most of the country the 75% rebate will be less then the liberal plans savings. once you start getting an even lower rebate as people above the lowest bracket will, the savings are much worse. for example, 50% on 70 bucks a day is 35 bucks a day per child, or 350% of the target 10$ a day. again, that cost can also rise, whereas 10$ a day has a clear cap. there is also nothing in the conservative rebate plan to increase capacity of daycare spaces available (liberals have this in their plan) so we could find ourselves in a supply/demand squeeze, driving up prices and thus driving that 25% people must pay faster then it otherwise would increase.

3) as for point 3, yes, the liberals, like any governing party, have broken some promises. however, the date of the policy expected to be 10$ is 2025, which would be at the end of the mandate if they were elected here, not after. it would be very clear whether they were successful or not by that point. we also have a working model in quebec that they literally just have to copy and they’ll be fine.



at the end of the day, i prefer the tried and true system. we know it is a viable solution to the problem. we know it can help a lot of people. we know it can boost economic activity and boost workforce participation and generate a profit. it seems foolish not to do it and go for an overly simplistic tax cut.",liberals

i agree, and i think that might actually be a good thing for the liberals.  every pm has a \"best before date\" and after enough time voters want a change (even if the pm is presumably doing a good job).

trudeau's broken promises and various scandals have probably moved that best before date up a bit.  the lpc might need a bit of time to shed themselves of him before he becomes a huge liability at the polls.

hafiz11,2021-08-26T00:53:46.000-07:00,"the poll thread - thursday, august 26, 2021 so i agree with you that overall the liberal plan is likely better for most people. i guess unlike most, i don’t think the cpc plan is an overall bad plan and either plan would be a huge improvement over the situation today. 

from an administrative perspective i think tax credits might be more efficient because i am
not sure how much bureaucracy might be required to administrate the liberal plan and i typically prefer plans that generate the least amount of bureaucracy. cra would administrate tax credits but for 10 dollar per day daycare i would assume their would be some type of program administrators that would have to work with the day cares themselves.

you appear to be correct and that’s good to hear, i am not sure where i heard it would take 5 years to implement.

i will say that the economy is in a very fragile state while we recover from the pandemic and potentially 75 percent benefit now might be better than 50 percent benefit now and additional benefit later.

2) unlike butts - who has actually worked for his party as an official, and then worked for the pmo in an official role when his party formed government - kouvalis is a hired gun who, these days, almost exclusively works as a hired gun consultant through the polling &amp; strategy firm he owns. he isn’t a party official, he doesn’t work in ford or o’toole’s offices - we don’t even know if he’s employed by their parties as a vendor or consultant (like i said, that’s relevant info). so without that detail, a more reasonable descriptor might be “former kellie leitch leadership campaign manager,” or “owner of conservative polling firm campaign research” or even “former conservative strategist.”

you say it's some sort of fundamentalism. while at the same time right wing parties have outright been courting right wing and alt-right fundamentalists for support.

it's the sort of gaslighting the republicans in the house are doing literally this moment demanding unity, when they themselves refuse unity and even a few implicated in actually participating in the coup.

both sides aren't equal. stop trying to peddle that please. if the \"left\" were courting nazi voices calling out for the elimination of peoples rights (or people), than you can jump into the equivelancy arguments.

the purpose of a budget is to outline *how* money will be spent in the future.


whereas the fiscal updates just tell us what money has been spent.


the thing is, a lot of issues will popup in the future that require spending. the process of sitting down and creating a budget will help them anticipate some of these expenses and plan for them.


the ppe shortage we had last year was a good example of that. at one point last year we were wasting money sending empty cargo planes back and forth to china, and the us almost cut off our shipments of n98 masks. it cost the country a lot of money and politcal capital to correct this. a lot of people felt blindsided by these events.


however, if they had sat down and planned out a proper budget at the beginning ot the year, they could have identified that the pandemic would cause issues in shipping and procurement, and started investing in domestic manufacturing. in the long run it would have cost us less money, and we wouldn't have had our supplies lines cut off by the us/chinese governments at inopportune times.


the author's main point is that a lot of the issues that cropped up last year were fairly predictable, even though it may have felt like they happened out of nowhere.

i mean the major 4 points he brings up for a plan will have literaly 0 impact on this at all

&gt;\"creates “good-paying jobs” by “unleashing our private sector,” supports resource industries, and “rebuilds our manufacturing sector” — with o’toole suggesting it’s “time for more made in canada.”
builds domestic vaccine capacity in canada and stops “taking vaccines from poorer countries,” a reference to the liberals’ accessing doses from the covax program.
gets federal spending “under control over the long term,” while avoiding “big cuts to important programs like health care and education” — two services under provincial, not federal, control.
“stands up to the chinese communist party,” and stops beijing from “sabotaging our economy here at home, and taking jobs from canadian workers.”

what i'm seeing from the above points is, slashing the budget, escalating tensions with china, maybe rebuild the vaccine production that their conservative predecessors sold off, and the ever nebulous \"unleashing the private sector\"

i think that this approach of calling out the rich could very much be an effective rhetorical tactic for the cpc, i just see 0 substance here, and as far as i know, they won't be tackling this in any serious matter at their upcoming convention. so they will likely have nothing or almost nothing of substance on this issue in the upcoming election.",liberals

tax rebates/credits effectively enshrine the current taxation, and then redistribute that taxation to various special interest groups. this creates a large, bloated government that gets to decide for you where your money goes. the entire rebate/credit system seems antithetical to libertarianism. i would expect libertarians to be more supportive of direct tax cuts, like the income tax cuts from 2015. 

government savings accounts aren't quite as bad, but they still force you to rely on the government to fund special purpose savings, instead of just letting you put that money to use yourself. instead of the government losing 1% revenue to a tax sheltered savings account, the government could just cut those taxes by 1%, give the consumer the same amount of money, but with additional freedom.

they have the liberals with strong leads in flamborough--glanbrook, kitchener--conestoga, hastings—lennox (sloan barely getting double digit support) and niagara falls. ndp have a double digit lead in essex.

they also show a tight race (within low single digits) in thornhill and brantford--brant. those should be very strong cpc ridings so it could be a bloodbath in ontario if these numbers are anywhere close.

the liberals don’t appear to be gaining much in terms of vote share, but some of the splits are wild. for example in brantford--brant, the lpc, cpc and ndp are within 6% of each other. the ndp and the ppc seems to be the main benefactor of the cpc collapse. both picking up on average around 4-8% increase in support.

&gt;  at one point, for example, despite a free trade agreement (fta), canada found itself denied access to crucial ppe when the trump administration prevented exports of face masks across the border. these specific problems have still not been properly addressed as we enter the second year of the pandemic.

canada not only [successfully leveraged](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2021/03/10/documents-reveal-the-trudeau-government-warned-donald-trump-not-to-cut-off-canadas-supply-of-critical-covid-19-masks-or-else.html) our integrated supply lines to force the trump admin to back down a little over a week after they tried to block exports, but the federal government also [directly addressed](https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/comm/aic-scr/provisions-supplies-eng.html) the lack of domestic production by working with the private sector to reorient their supply chains and production lines to produce needed ppe right here in canada. 

&gt; more worrisome was the inability of the liberal government to project sufficiently ahead, failing to establish a manufacturing base for vaccines in canada, and failing to ensure a majority of canadians would be vaccinated by the middle of 2021

okay, for one they did project ahead and that's why the feds secured a 10x redundancy in supply. for another, there *is* a domestic vaccine manufacturing base that can be converted to produce rona vaccines, but you'll need to ask sanofi or gsk why they haven't worked out a deal with az or j&amp;j to produce rona vaccines under license in canada. for a third, the feds have addressed the lack of private sector movement by the big established players by investing hundreds of millions into alternate domestic avenues: $126 million into a federally-owned facility that will produce the novavax vaccine, and $173 million to medicago to set up a new vaccine production facility in canada. and lastly, by june there will be enough vaccines here to give a shot to every adult in canada who wants one, and june is halfway through the year.

&gt; this is not a question of whether meng should be freed of all charges; it is a question of why, in the first place, canada’s security establishment accommodated america’s request when other countries declined that option

a more relevant set of questions would be: how many of the other states that has meng traveled to have extradition treaties with the usa that are broad enough to cover the crime that meng is accused of, and how many of them were also specifically requested by the us to detain meng and ignored that request?  

notice, too, how certain things were conveniently left out of the analysis in order to protect the desired conclusion that \"meanwhile, canada stands on the outside looking in.\" can't talk about the lead role in coordinating the hemisphere via the lima group to oppose maduro's destruction of venezuela, can't talk about building from scratch the international effort to eliminate arbitrary state detentions of innocent people during disputes, and can't talk about salvaging the tpp after its anchor withdrew, because talking about any of those three examples contradicts the idea that canada is on the outside looking in.",liberals

hdq7h2z,2021-09-21T01:23:58.000-07:00,"cbc projects liberal victory i'll assume this is being asked in good faith and give an answer. i'll preface this by saying that i voted ndp. while i would have preferred they form the government it was realistically never going to happen, and a liberal minority propped up by the ndp is pretty much the best outcome i could have reasonably expected from the election. i don't love trudeau, there are other politicians, hell, even other liberals, i'd rather see as prime minister, but i think he's done reasonably well and i'm not dissatisfied with his governance.

with that out of the way, i, and i think many others on the left, see the \"scandals and corruption\" as being generally fairly minor but completely overblown by the opposition:

the aga khan scandal was a legitimate failure on trudeau's part, but a minor one that speaks more about poor judgement than corruption. 

the snc lavalin scandal was minor and completely overblown, while he shouldn't have tried to influence the ag's decision on issuing a dpa, it could equally be argued that he would have been failing on his role as pm if he hadn't at least suggested it, as snc is a massive canadian employer and it could have been devastating if they were barred from government contracts. i see it as more of a demonstration of why having the justice minister, a political posting and cabinet minister who answers to the pm, and the attorney general, a position responsible for administering canadian law free from political influence, being the same person is a terrible idea. it is perfectly reasonable for the pm to ask the justice minister to look into dpas, but not the attorney general. either way, his interference came to naught and in the end the courts gave snc a lighter punishment than they would have gotten from the dpa. 

as for the we scandal, it was pretty much a complete nothingburger. the ethics commissioner didn't find any wrongdoing on trudeau's part, and morneau was only found to be in conflict of interest for 40k in travel expenses, which he rightfully resigned over. career public servants repeatedly testified on committee hearings that there was no political pressure and nothing untoward had happened.

while small scandals piling up like this are a bad look for a government, no government is going to rule for 6 years and come out squeaky clean and as far as baggage goes this isn't that bad. what certainly doesn't help the opposition is the way they have treated these scandals, for example while the we scandal eventually ended up being pretty minor the opposition spent months of parliamentary and committee time hounding the government over it during the middle of a pandemic. for those of us on the left who read past the all caps headlines and the fiery speeches from the opposition and see all this rhetoric about corruption, failures of government, and calls for the pm to resign, all over really quite minor issues, it makes it hard to take the opposition seriously. i had serious reservations voting for singh because of his part in it. in my mind, the constant scramble for find anything the opposition could use to paint trudeau badly, reasonable or not, did more to hurt my opinion of them than my opinion of trudeau.

as for trudeau's blackface, most on the left look at this from the view that it needs to be in the context of his other actions. most times when the left comes out swinging against politicians when something like this comes out it's because it no longer allows them to hide their racist views. the blackface or racist/sexist statements or whatever it is add context to their current actions (or lack there of) on the relavent issues. in trudeau's case, it adds to the context of him taking action on indigenous and racial issues, and it's a lot easier to believe a politician when they say they've changed when they have actually demonstrated evidence of it like trudeau has. 

i don't know anyone on my side of the spectrum that didn't cringe and want answers when they saw those photos, but with trudeau's history of action, and not to mention his masterful apology (whether you believe it is genuine or not it is the pinnacle of political apologies, i'd recommend watching it if you havent) most are willing to accept that his past actions came from entitlement and ignorance rather than malice, and that makes all the difference.

i personally see trudeau and his government as generally good intentioned but with some serious missteps. i see trudeau as being entitled, ignorant in some respects, and a bit out of touch, but i dont think he's corrupt, bad intentioned, or evil. i don't agree with all their policies, but generally i think the liberals do more good than harm, and the harm they do isn't as bad as the harm other parties could do if given power.",liberals

if you look at the way that o'toole's momentum stalled during the campaign, i think that it's pretty clear that the stall happened when voters started to notice that his rhetoric was extremely inconsistent. at the beginning--when he was focused on centrist messaging--is when he had the most momentum, and it was only after a sustained period of dual-messaging that his momentum stalled.

contrast this to how tim houston won the ns election by rigidly adhering to a few key messages, the majority focused on healthcare, throughout the entire campaign. his discipline ensured that none of the questions that were raised about o'toole ever came up, and as a result the voters rewarded him with a surprise majority.",conservatives

i read [this post-debate article](https://www.straight.com/news/politicians-exploit-phrasing-of-shachi-kurls-question-to-avoid-very-real-issue-of-racism-in) and was honesty surprised by how explicit the author was in explaining why using the word 'discriminatory' was a mistake and how kurl should have framed the question using sympathetic examples and appeals to authority.

the author doesn't disagree the laws are discriminatory, he calls them \"clearly discriminatory laws.\" he just thinks that kurl should have used common journalistic techniques to state that in a roundabout way.

i thought it was a moment of clarity and refreshing honesty in the debate, a direct confrontation that revealed two very different value systems that absolutely exist in canada today. it was also revealing for canadians to see how every major party speaks out of two sides of their mouth when it comes to appealing for quebec votes.

for the conservatives to make ground, o'toole (or some other leader) needs to whip his party into line and not tolerate the extremist eruptions from backbenchers (much like harper did). i don't really see this happening in the near future, because the conservatives have been doubling down on their unappealing policies for over a decade now and it just isn't working -- but the alternative is changing and growing, which really seems to be anathema to conservative mindsets.",conservatives

what part of this is fearmongering? this is what businesses do, they make products to meet consumer need. that requires monetary investment, and it is often done that way because there is an expected profit afterwards that is supposed to pay for that investment in addition to it producing a profit.

gpkxbos,2021-03-03T05:28:33.000-08:00,"u.s and them — march 03, 2021 hi there, i was born in canada and lived here my whole life, but my parents are both from new york (upstate and the city). overall canada is a good place to live--we have universal healthcare (although no dental, vision, or pharma unfortunately); our taxes are higher than the us, but we get more government services and a stronger safety net (and historically speaking our taxes are still pretty low); college is comparatively inexpensive; and our election seasons are short (whereas presidential campaigns start two years before the election, in canada political campaigns start two months before the election (at most), and we're less polarized (abortion and guns are not big wedge issues)).

we have moderate gun control, and america's gun culture isn't anywhere near as prominent in canada (although there are parts of the country where you'll find it). if we have an equivalent to the nra, i've never heard of it. i definitely like the gun control we have, i think it's more reasonable than america's gun control, and the liberals have been strengthening our gun control laws recently.

i work in retail so i'm biased, but people aren't particularly polite here--at least not to a noteworthy extent. they aren't particularly rude either. it's kinda a grab bag in my opinion. last time i went to the states (east coast) was 2011, and i thought americans seemed pretty friendly, so i don't think we're all that different in this regard. my grandparents moved here a few years back, and thanks to [bowling for columbine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjbtb4bs0q), they weren't locking their doors. so here i am saying, \"why aren't you locking your doors? you have to lock your doors!\" it's definitely safe to live in canada, but that's no reason to be complacent. but yes, people are pretty laid back, and they do things on their own time.

do canadians hate americans? my dad thinks so (perhaps not so much anymore), but my mom doesn't. i'd say hate's too strong of a word, but the nationalism can be pretty intense and unreasonable. many of our issues our similar to those in the states, but oftentimes we will take a liberal stance on america's flaws while looking the other way on our flaws, i.e., we'll recoil in horror at the way black americans are treated and we'll support black lives matter, but we can be quick to turn our heads with regards to issues concerning the colonization of first nations. in some parts of canada, you'll see hate directed at the us from a conservative perspective as well: in some provinces (looking at you, alberta and saskatchewan) people will drive around with confederate flags. there's not many of them, though, thankfully. somehow canadians have figured out how to have both a superiority and inferiority complex regarding the us--both at the same time haha. but it's a good country and i definitely enjoy living here. i'll tell you this, as much as i like america, looking at the us right now, *there is nearly zero chance that i would choose to live there over canada*, so that probably says it all. but both are good countries and you can't go wrong with either i'd say.",liberals

prime  minister justin trudeau is concealing - yet again - the nefarious truth  of manufacturer's vaccine delivery reduction or cancellation as it  applies to cansino, pfizer, moderna and johnson and johnson.

nobody  seems to want to remember last week, that prime minister justin trudeau  was still promising a target of six million doses delivered by the end  of march.

pfizer was originally  going to deliver a total of four million doses in the first quarter,   while moderna was set to deliver 2 million doses - delivery targets  being promised by prime minister justin trudeau.

as of this week, canada has received 1.4 million doses of both the moderna and pfizer products (short 3.6 million doses).

pfizer  has committed over the next two weeks to delivery of 878,000  more pfizer shots, then 888,000 more before march 15th. meanwhile,  moderna has only committed to shipping 168,000 doses of  their vaccine over the next two weeks.

all  told, we expect delivery of 3,334,000 shots by march 15. that means the  two manufacturers will be short 2,666,000 doses combined from what  trudeau promised.

this isn't true though. you can repeat it ad nauseum but that also doesn't make it true. and ironically, given your defense of the humanities, it sounds more or less like the same argument that \"conservatives\" throw against the humanities isn't it? that they just teach an ideology, not science. perhaps this is intentional, in which case kudos.

in the 90s, ottawa was contending with elevated boc interest rates, because their focus was finishing off the last of 70s era inflation. this elevated debt servicing costs, which is what made the fiscal consolidation necessary.

what made this less painful than it would have been otherwise is that they could do this during america's clinton era bull market, so private sector activity was strong and was able to pick up quite a bit of the demand slack.

trudeau 2.0 is reacting to the post 2008 macro enviroment. private sector demand has generally been soft since then, which has made a public sector stimulus generally more advisable. meanwhile, the low-interest rate environment since 2008 has made the costs to the government of running deficits about has low as they've ever been, generally speaking, ottawa's fiscal position comfortably got better pretty much every year since 2008 under both harper and trudeau, despite both of them being in deficit pretty much every year.",liberals

&gt;i get the sentiment of social conservatives that don't want marriages to be as easy as changing socks. 

you get it, but you don't think it really matters all that much, or the cost of enforcing chastity and fidelity via stigma, social custom and even law is too much for you to consider it worthwhile? i think a whole family is one of the most important things civilizations can produce, so i put more stock in it.

&gt;at the same time, to me marriages shouldn't even involve the state except to ensure it isn't incest or abusive.

i could get on board with marriage being a true sacrament again with little to no state involvement, but the church(es) would need enforcement mechanisms of its/their own. i can't get behind this insipid \"well, they weren't in love anymore, so it's time for a no-fault divorce\" nonsense.

source? a simple [google](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-pfizer-brazil-iduskbn2b02jc) shows that this is not true.


the brazil variant panic is predicated on a single study of blood donors that found ~70% of blood donors had antibodies. blood donors are not a representative population, especially as it was the only way to get free antibody tests at the time. actual confirmed reinfections in manaus? 3.


&gt;however, according to official reports 3 there were only 3 reinfections confirmed in the state of amazonas (4 million population including the capital manaus). in other regions, reinfection is generally rare 4,5. if a substantial amount of reinfections cannot be found in manaus, then the blood donor study 2 most likely overestimated the population sero-prevalence. indeed, a population sero-prevalence study in 133 brazilian cities including manaus 6 found a much smaller (∼20%) sero-prevalence in july-august, 2020. hence, the blood donor data in manaus 2 are most likely biased and/or their analyses are flawed 7. in this work. we revisit the blood donor data in manaus with the aim to reveal the possible reasons behind the discrepancy.


this is to be expected as natural infection offers as good protection as the best vaccines.


&gt;public health england regularly tested two matched groups of volunteers between june and november — 6,000 health workers who had previously been infected with coronavirus and 14,000 who had not.


&gt;a comparison of infections in the two groups, described in preliminary results released on thursday, found that prior infection provided at least 83 per cent protection against reinfection. it gave better than 94 per cent protection against symptomatic covid-19, matching the figures for the most effective covid-19 vaccines.",liberals

&gt;central canada (sometimes the central provinces) is a region consisting of canada's two largest and most populous provinces: ontario and quebec.

that isn't how voting works. **you can win an election with just one vote if everyone else is too apathetic to vote**. so political parties often want to *reduce* turnout. **some politicians benefit from apathy and want people to stay home**, which is unacceptable. the only solution is for everyone's voice to be heard.

frankly, i think o'toole needs an election loss to finally allow him to smack down the factions in his own party, and to educate him on what he needs to do, because right now the tories have absolutely no vision whatsoever. they have become so comfortable playing the malcontent card that they can't see that that is the tactic of losers.",conservatives

i hoped o'toole would win the leadership race and he has. i agree with most of his platform and he would be amazing for alberta, however he's been disappointing me lately. he's backed tracked a bit on his platform already and has been submitting more and more to canadians left of centre and the media. o'toole acknowledges the alt-left and ridiculousness of identity politics, however, his actions speak otherwise. i don't know if it's all a rouse until he gets elected. i hope it is.

there's one more thing that irks me and that is about the conservative party itself. i don't know what happens when a candidate gets elected party leader, but it's clear that something strange happens. they immediately become a scumbag corrupt politician. no matter how wholesome or genuine they are before getting elected, they turn into an unlikable piece of shit. same thing happened to andrew scheer. i mean, he was already unlikable, but then he turned into a corrupt evil monster. look what they did to maxime bernier and the ppc. even the leadership race itself i have my suspicions about.",conservatives

which would tend to infringe on people's rights and therefore conservatives woudln't be fond of it. \"future crimes\" is not a conservative position.  

i think you are confusing something else which is a conservative position, which is results based methods. conservatives like results, they like to say \"if we do this, then we should get that - oh look we got that, now i'm happy\" :)   some policing methods are seen to be very effective in relation to the inconvenience they represent.  but no - conservatives do not believe in giving police or law the power to proactively stop crimes. 

examples - the gun registry and gun laws in general. designed to prevent future crimes with guns. conservatives hate them. not only are they an infringement, they don't work. 

&gt;i meant nowadays she is really hated

ahhh -  that makes a little more sense :)  well reddit is a pretty hard left site these days for the most part, and as you say the iron lady was fond of dismantling socialist programs. 

&gt;not what i've been taught. 

well if you're a conservative think about how you feel about it. do you want a bunch of regulation determining how you are supposed to live? 

&gt;simply talking about the desire for immigrants to learn our ways, beliefs and history.

well i think if that's your definition of assimilation then you've perhaps stretched the term a little farther than it normally would be. there is a huge difference between assimilation and adaptation pr integration. it is expected people will learn the ways of this country and adapt to it or integrate with it, but they can certainly keep their own culture as well and there's a lot of room for both.   but - i think i get where you were going with that a little better now.
