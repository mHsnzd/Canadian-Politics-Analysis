&gt;and that's why the border with the us is open and people from québec can freely travel to new brunswick.

that's part of a comprehensive travel restriction not targeted ban.

&gt;travel bans work, but it can't be restricted to a single country. if everyone had shut their borders to china in december 2019 when taiwan blew the whistle on the new pneumonia they had found in chinese tourists, who knew if we could have avoided the worst, or at least had more time to prepare.

a wide ban on travel was not what sloan was advocating for nor criticizing in april. if you hop way way way back in my history i said the same shit when the first time he opened his mouth. i even replying to you specifically.

he was on a tangent after the fact, thinking a ban on chinese travellers back in february would have helped. the bulk of canada's first wave was quebecois travellers to the us. his advice was stupid bullshit and it clearly a partisan and slightly racist attack on tam.

you can either go big and go with a fill travel ban which much of the world did after it was too late or institute quarintines.

you also don't seem to know much about taiwan, it implimented it's sars protocols. they had a specific travel from wuhan shut down in january and a full travel ban from everywhere in march. because their targeted ban didn't seem to work.


&gt;sloan's position was way closer to that than tam's position and the trudeau government policy, which was to add a question to people on the form when they entered the country and... that's it.

not even close. sloan was retroactively advocating for a targeted ban in april as part of his questioning the loyalty of tam over the bog standard advice she gave. the government was in a general travel locked down.

&gt;so even if you say that sloan's position wasn't the best answer, it was still less wrong than tam's position at the time, which was the who's position adopted on january 31st that there was no reason to put any restriction on travel or trade (even if china had stopped all trade and travel into and out of wuhan a week before that).

the who position was specifically \"targetted travel bans don't work\". their citations were based on research on mers, sars, and ebola.

sloan's position was retrospective regret that we didn't have a targetted chinese travel ban before. ignoring most of our cases came from the us and the west coast was very light on infections at the time. 

the examples of a snap targeted ban on chinese travellers was the us and italy and the uk. none of those went that well. the disease was already in italy and spread through europe to the uk and the us. they would be better off with a lightly enforced quarintine.

i notice you don't even actually try to debunk these claims yourself. you merely dismiss them and claim that they're \"long discredited. could you actually put the time in to explain why &amp; how? 

in regards to the cambodian genocide, chomsky's stance was the same as it's generally been in regards to u.s enemies in various conflicts. casting doubt/undermining the claims made by the u.s government and other media sources regarding the claims of the khemer rogue's atrocities while being more eager to point out the fault of the united states. this is addressed here: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political\\_positions\\_of\\_noam\\_chomsky#doubting\\_genocide\\_in\\_cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#doubting_genocide_in_cambodia)

 

&gt;in july 1978, chomsky and his collaborator, edward s. herman jumped into the controversy. chomsky and herman reviewed three books about cambodia. two of the books by [john barron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_barron_(journalist)) (and [anthony paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=anthony_paul&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)) and [françois ponchaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_ponchaud) were based on interviews with cambodian refugees and concluded that the khmer rouge had killed or been responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of cambodians. the third book, by scholars [gareth porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gareth_porter) and [george hildebrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_hildebrand), described the kr in highly favorable terms. chomsky and herman called barron and paul's book \"third rate propaganda\" and part of a \"vast and unprecedented propaganda campaign\" against the kr. he said ponchaud was \"worth reading\" but unreliable. chomsky said that refugee stories of kr atrocities should be treated with great \"care and caution\" as no independent verification was available. by contrast, chomsky was highly favorable toward the book by porter and hildebrand, which portrayed cambodia under the khmer rouge as a \"bucolic idyll.\" chomsky also opined that the documentation of gareth porter's book was superior to that of ponchaud's, despite almost all of the references cited by porter coming from khmer rouge documents while ponchaud's came from speaking to cambodian refugees.[\\[95\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-95)  
&gt;  
&gt;chomsky and herman later co-authored a book about cambodia titled *after the cataclysm* (1979), which appeared after the khmer rouge regime had been deposed. the book was described by cambodian scholar [sophal ear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sophal_ear) as \"one of the most supportive books of the khmer revolution\" in which they \"perform what amounts to a defense of the khmer rouge cloaked in an attack on the media\".[\\[96\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-sear-96) in the book, chomsky and herman acknowledged that \"the record of atrocities in cambodia is substantial and often gruesome\", but questioned their scale, which may have been inflated \"by a factor of 100\". khmer rouge agricultural policies reportedly produced \"spectacular\" results.\"[\\[97\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-97)  
&gt;  
&gt;contrary to chomsky and herman, the reports of massive khmer rouge atrocities and starvation in cambodia proved to be accurate and uninflated. many deniers or doubters of the cambodian genocide recanted their previous opinions, but chomsky continued to insist that his analysis of cambodia was without error based on the information available to him at the time.[\\[98\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-98) herman addressed critics in 2001: \"chomsky and i found that the very asking of questions about ... the victims in the anti-khmer rouge propaganda campaign of 1975–1979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as 'apologetics for pol pot'.\"[\\[99\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-99)

these sorts of revisions/interpretations of contemporary events and/or atrocities have regularly been parroted by chomsky: 

in regards to the yugoslavian wars. [this site](http://balkanwitness.glypx.com/chomskydenial.htm) does an excellent job citing multiple excerpts from chomsky on the conflict that regularly underplayed miloslavic and the serbian government's involvement in the conflict and subsequent war crimes, while placing  disproportionate blame on the united states and nato.

&gt;chomsky claims that the construction of global institutions and agreements such as the [world trade organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_trade_organization), the [general agreement on tariffs and trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_agreement_on_tariffs_and_trade) (gatt), the [north american free trade agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_free_trade_agreement) (nafta), and the [multilateral agreement on investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multilateral_agreement_on_investment) constitute new ways of securing élite privileges while undermining democracy.[\\[31\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_positions_of_noam_chomsky#cite_note-31) chomsky believes that these austere and [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neoliberal) measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing cheap labor, raw materials and investment opportunities for the [developed world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developed_world). additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.

back to you:

&gt;you're not making any sense, or you're intentionally misreading me.

could you then please take the time to actually explain in detail how i'm misreading you instead of making a list of declarative statements without providing evidence to affirm them?

&gt;i quoted from the treaty itself; you are clearly incorrect in stating that the treaty does not hold states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.

there's no legal binding in the treaty to eliminate nuclear weapons.  t[here are eleven separate articles in the treaty](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text), none of which require the five nuclear states to completely remove their nuclear articles.

&gt;and am pointing out the undeniable fact that the longer nuclear weapons exist, the more likely we are to confront nuclear war.

you're confusing undeniable facts with personal conjecture.

&gt;if there were no nuclear arms, there would be no chance of nuclear war.

yet again though, the chance of nuclear war remain unlikely and there is no objective/factual assertion to be made that nuclear war is an inevitable posibility (or even a highly likely one) provided nuclear weapons continue to exist.

however, you also seem to be casual ignoring the more objective reality, which is that without nuclear arms  larger scale conventional warfare would become much more common and there'd be less incentives for superpowers to avoid conventional conflict.

&gt;readers can familiarise themselves with the doomsday clock (managed be the bulletin of the atomic scientists), and why the organisation has moved its clock only 100 seconds from midnight:

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;your view is comically out of touch with expert opinion. again, look at the doomsday clock.

[you mean this doomsday clock](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xdklal6qv88/xui8j_xyqti/aaaaaaaah8g/zoefntblbswzcraxxjhmbnv4ezqaneq5aclcbgas/s1600/2019_doomsday_clock_graph.png), that's shown a constant 30 decade  increase n the potential threat of nuclear war since 1991? basically ignoring the gigantic reduction in nuclear arsenal between 1991 and now?

i don't think you can call someone else out of touch, when citing sources that are much more noticeably out of touch with the objective reduction in the threat of nuclear war since 1991. the fact that the clock cites an increased threat of war since 1991 tends to place it's reliability into question.  for instance, steven pinker makes some fairly accurate critiques of the doomsday clock in his writings. likewise, the clock lacks any hard methodology to back its estimates up, which is an issue citied by multiple academics. this again brings it's accuracy into question.",liberals

the industrial pricing system works in a similar way to the household rebate. each firm in a particular high-emissions sector (say cement) pays the full carbon price. then most of the revenue from that sector (80% or 90%) is divided up based on output (e.g. number of tonnes of cement produced) and returned to firms in that sector.

basically dirtier firms (higher emissions per output than average) are subsidizing cleaner firms, and the overall profitability of the sector doesn't change much, so that firms don't just shift their operations abroad (which would have zero impact on global emissions, while having a major economic impact here).

because firms are paying the full carbon price, they have a strong incentive to look for ways to cut any emissions that are less than that price. the output-based subsidy doesn't change that, because it depends on the average emissions intensity **for all firms in the sector**. if i'm running a firm and i figure out a way to cut co2 emissions by 2t per unit of output, that saves the firm $80 per unit, not 20% of $80.",liberals

2. i think you might might be looking for 'rational political action' here when that's not really it. i don't think sloan or socons who would follow him aspire to win a federal election, any more than sloan thought he would actually win the cpc leadership. they're a minority, they know it, it's become an identifying principle for them. it's a circle of validation. it's not a great political strategy but it may be a good *cultural* one.",conservatives

and then there is the globalists vs nationalists. the globalists don't seem to have much interest or care for our culture, values and traditions, discarding them as antiquated, insensitive, or even non-existent (trudeau). they do this even while waxing poetic about the cultures of everyone else, from quebecers to natives, to all the newcomers to canada.  but people need a place to belong, something to be a part of and to take pride in. children in canada now are being taught to be ashamed of its history, and only the worst parts are highlighted for them. they're being taught all our ancestors and the great people who built this country were morally unforgiveable, and that everything they did was an abuse of others.

how are they supposed to take pride in their nation? and if they have no such pride how do they cherish it or feel a sense of belonging with it and with their countrymen? and if they don't then there's nothing to hold them together when things get rough. and they will get rough. things always do eventually.",liberals

let us look at sloan's statement on the matter:

where here does he criticize trudeau or ask for his resignation?

don't you think sloan here is implying that tam is ceding sovereignty to the who? getting faulty information from the who and acting on that faulty information is not the same thing as connecting the removal of tam as public health officer with ensuring \"the un, the who and chinese communist propaganda \\[does not\\] have a say over canada's public health.\"

developing advice on the basis of bad information is not akin to ceding sovereignty to the producer of said advice. if she was suckered, he's blaming her for placing the same trust in the institution that everyone else did. if she wasn't suckered then he's accusing her of being loyal to china (\"chinese communist propaganda\"). one is much worse than the other, but i don't see why being suckered by a trusted institution means you should resign. it's not like canada responded any worse or slowly than any other government.",liberals

sure, but your initial comment specifically stated violent crime, and that is what i am disagreeing with. violent crime in canada is not overwhelmingly caused by people intoxicated by hard drugs, and if those drugs were completely removed from the equation, then there is no evidence that violent crime would dramatically decrease. 

and again, legalizing drugs does not necessarily equate to an increase in usage. that is why i stated legalization of marijuana in canada. legalizing these substances would take money away from the black markets, ensure quality control, and hopefully lead to revenue that could be used to council those with addiction issues. the vast majority of people who have done hard drugs have done so in an experimental way, very few become addicted. i mentioned alcohol several times because it is the one substance that supports your argument that many violent crimes in canada were committed while the perpetrator was intoxicated.

ngl, this is my favourite conversation. what are 'hard drugs' to you? do psychadelics fall under this category? people can do some pretty wild shit while having a psychotic episode on lsd or nbome. how about mdma? i guarantee when/if molly is legalized for public consumption, sexual assault will go way the fuck up. street amphetamines or just meth? did you know that its mainly the route of administration that causes fucked up behavior? smoking an unknown quantity of meth versus eating a known quantity of meth) produce completely different highs. cocaine? fentanyl has caused coke to be accidentally (typically at least. no dealer wants to kill their paying customers) cut with cocaine because the distributors are the same. benzos? they're one of the most addicting downers out there and no one outside the drug community really talks about it. pcp may absolutely destroy people, but it's analogues (o-pce, 3-meo variants) produce one of the most pleasant, controllable highs, assuming you dose correctly. ketamine has both therapeutic use but if you mix it with alcohol or ghb then you're way more likely to pass out or even possibly die.

it seems to me that drugs have upsides and downsides. you know what the problem is? we don't train people how to consume alcohol properly. we just give our kids $100 on their 18th birthday and say 'have fun', and hope that the hangover is brutal enough to 'teach a lesson'. you know what would be so much better? harm reduction. teaching about dosing curves in math classes. do you know what the neurotoxicity of alcohol is and how it affects your brain over the course of your life? biology. talking about the socio-economic implications of being an alcoholic. setting up support programs that don't end in 'accept jesus christ as your lord and savior\". when you turn 18, we ought to have to take a test to consume alcohol, so at the very least we can all be aware of the impacts.

&gt;it's a strawman.

you can't change the fact that was the basis of his critique. it was a conservative pet policy of a snap ban and secondarily about the change on mask recommendations. all retrospective critiques with the main one was already known to be ineffectively and in the countries that did do a snap ban it didn't help at all. as for masks, what ever calculus they were making about mask supply or the past research that americans are really bad at masks is a retrospective critique.

&gt;ah, suddenly you're changing your tune. you used to claim the who recommendation was good science and that critics didn't know better so they should shut up, now you're trying to excuse the who for its poor recommendation, without first going through the step of admitting i was right and you were wrong with regards to the quality of the who advice.

they will always stop short of hard or expensive recommendations, until the science is definitive because they had their fingers slapped in the past for making urgent recommendations. however with disease, every adequate handling will look like over kill (wuhan lock down, new zealand full travel ban).

go way way way way back in my history. my tune hasn't; changed. 

they are a source of data but the politics of the un stop them from making statements only on science. stakeholders like the us and canada and the eu push them to stop short but the governments will know the off record recommendations. i suspect you don't remember a damn thing about past conversations because i've said this before, and for almost a full year. the who is a baseline, countries push it down to there. due to not wanting to spend. they are an aggregator of research and data.

the point stands, the conservative pet theory of a snap ban on a country wasn't going to work. didn't work in the countries that tried. not only in canada but all conservative governments around the world. it was step #1 for many. most of them did worse than we did because those governments tended to feel they could 'react; to it as opposed to taking broader measures like masking and quarantine. those factions are still the ones raising opposition to masking.

massive bailouts? those are royalty and tax holidays to promote year over year investment from these companies instead of having them wait out their payback period before continuing. the sum total of all taxes and royalties owed are paid out in **full** eventually but on a back loaded repayment curve.

&gt;why did the canadian government have to buy the pipeline between alberta and bc? if it's so profitable the company running it should have been fighting tooth and nail to keep those profits...

because the bloody thing had been under review by the neb since [dec. 16, 2013](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trans-mountain-timeline-key-dates-in-the-history-of-the-pipeline-1.1051106). the liberals proceeded to buy the whole company in 2018 after kinder morgan pulled up stakes in canada, fed up with the completely unnavigable regulatory regime after waiting 5 years to develop an existing right of way. how long were they supposed to wait? what is reasonable to you?

you seemingly don't understand how these holiday programs work if you think these are some sort of life support for industry. i've addressed this above.

&gt;here's the simple fact, oil peaked in 2014, and has been either holding, or shrinking ever since, add to that, the cost of oil (profit for alberta/canada) is highly dependent on the moods of russia and the middle east, both of which are hostile towards us in terms of oil competition.

what exactly peaked in 2014? the near term price? demand is forecast to grow for at least a decade and then slowly decline over a hundred years.

o&amp;g is profitable today but growth is more controlled as profits aren't as extreme as they were under $100 oil right. moreover, comparing alberta heavy to saudi ultra light is facetious, no refinery in na can take straight light crude and deliver on its product slate. every single refinery in the world needs heavy crude to blend. as soon as we're able to access the pacific via tmx the wcs diff. is going to narrow $5 usd overnight. if we get access to the atlantic that diff. delta becomes $10 usd.

however, the liberals lead by a much higher proportion of the votes in ontario and quebec, which have much larger populations. for example, alberta has 4.3 million people, quebec has 8.5 million, and ontario has 14.5 million people. having 40% of the vote in alberta is less total votes than having 40% in ontario or quebec. 

that's also the same reason why the bloc get more seats than the ndp, they have a higher percentage of votes coming from a more populated area (quebec) than the ndp which doesn't have the most support out of the parties in any province (i.e. the ndp's votes are more diffuse and spread out - you need to capture votes that are concentrated in each province's ridings to win the riding's seat). 

so the issue is that cpc concentrates their voter base in select areas, whereas the liberals have support across the country and in more populous regions, meaning they receive more total votes. seems pretty fair to me. that is the same reason stephen harper won before as well, he was able to capture votes in more populated provinces like ontario.

the only other alternative would be something like a proportional representation system (you get the same % of seats as the % of vote you get), but the liberals would still lead under this model too (albeit with a minority government probably).",liberals

* pcs governed from 2003-2015 and wrecked the provinces finances.

* liberals won a massive majority of 31 seats in 2015. their government then made many unpopular decisions and faced many scandals in the first term.

* 2019 election rolls around and the pcs gain due to voter's anger with the liberals but too many are still mad about the last pc government so the liberals are able to hold power with 20 seats (one short of a majority). the uncharismatic leader that the pcs had certainly didn't help either.

* the 2019 election also resulted in the ndp gaining a third seat in labrador and 2 former liberals being re-elected as independents.

* the covid-19 pandemic hits in early 2020. the province locked down and then stalled its reopening while keeping tight travel restrictions in place. since april 2020, no community spread of covid-19 happened, not even in the fall when the rest of canada faced a second wave. 

* the liberals see a massive polling boost at the expense of both other parties because of the pandemic.

* new brunswick and british columbia (also both minority governments) hold snap elections which both result in a majority for the governing party. newfoundland &amp; labrador's liberals see a chance for a majority and an election is called for february 13, 2021.

* throughout the campaign, the ndp was able to win supporters from the liberals but pc support didn't change and the liberals still had a large lead. it probably didn't help that the pcs haven't changed their leader from last time and still have a poor reputation from their last time in power.

* 1 seat is pretty much safe for the pcs due to the lack of liberal organization and controversy surrounding the liberal candidate.

mainstreet's polls happened too early for the notes below to affect their numbers so their prediction is based on the notes above only. also, everything below has happened only within the past 7 days.

* community spread of covid-19 is found during the final week of the campaign which raises questions about how people in quarantine could vote.

* covid-19 quickly spreads as the days go on, raising questions on if it is even safe to go to the polls. many polling station workers quit, causing staff shortages for elections nl with only a few days left before the election.

* elections nl cancels the election on the avalon peninsula (roughly ~50% of the population) and plans to hold it at a later date while the rest of the province would still be voting on february 13. questions are raised about the legality of this move.

* on the night before the election, the provincial government confirms that the outbreak is of the uk variant and orders an immediate province-wide lockdown. elections nl (with less than 12 hours before the polls open) cancels all in-person voting to make the election mail-in only.",liberals

i don't know if it is the specific topic, or if it is the sub/reddit or what.  


it is the same as how even the narwhal and other media outlets friendly with the opposition to the entire project don't seem to touch the point that aside from campbell's really blatant malfeasance and habit of directly lying to the public, snc lavalin has been the most consistent thread through the project since the 80s, and performed the surveys in 2005 that were an indicator that the project was intended to go through even though it was 9 years until that was announced.  


that would be the same executive and administration face of the company that was the focus of the recent scandals rocking the trudeau government.   


that itself was ironic considering the loudest voices during that \"scandal\" were the conservative opposition, while in 2014 when snc lavalin was supposed to be prevented from bidding on contracts for the government due to the same crimes, rather than obliquely have members of his cabinet hint at anybody that slack should be cut, harper just rewrote the laws.  


that same continuity is also a clear requirement for the site c dam to have managed to capture the permits that it has over the course of two separate federal governments, including some that seemingly could only be issued if the applications were effectively pre-stamped de facto.

firstly, we are involved. we are involved at every stage of diplomacy to try and deescalate the conflict. the implications that we are endorsing this war is absolutely preposterous. 

secondly, a genocide is literally what will happen if we leave, not stay. literally read the link i sent you. myanmar doesn't give a shit about starting a genocide because their allies will support them through it. do you honestly believe that canada will support sa through a genocide? really? this is just you showing your lack of understanding of basic diplomacy. sa's allies will not support a genocide and sa knows that. they won't go that far, because they know that their entire alliance network will abandon them for even trying.

thirdly, the fact that you are literally willing to wash your hands of this situation and let millions die without even trying to do anything is what is actually disgusting to me. you think that if we left this would end. there is a level of indescribable hubris and ego in that which makes you a genuinely awful person who i hope never gets involved in foreign policy. foreign policy is the most difficult position in any government because every decision costs lives in one way or another. canada's goal is to minimize the number of deaths, and your solutions will objectively do the opposite of that in the long term.",liberals

the strategy for a socon dominated cpc is essentially wait for incumbent fatigue to *really* kick in and pray that there's enough cpc/lpc swing voter who will say \"fuck it, i want a tax cut/won't somebody please think of the deficit!\" or \"well they'll never be able to *actually* restrict abortion/lgbt+ rights\" and vote for the cpc regardless of who's in charge. essentially the current long shot cpc strategy but even longer of a shot.

as for your other point, there are definitely some excellent parallels to be drawn from militant in the labour party and the clc in the cpc however i don't think it's quite 1:1 as you've described. 

militant was an explicitly entryist group. they were outsiders who came from britain's well established far left tradition seeking to hijack labour's political apparatus for their own purposes. while the labour party oscillated between varying levels of socialist and social democrat, there has always been a barrier between them and the proper far left. 

while the campaign life coalition may technically be outsiders to the cpc, social conservatives are not. the ideological tradition that the clc represents is one of the founding groups of the cpc, having maintained a strong foothold in the reform party prior to unification. so it's less entryism and more a disgruntled faction trying to stage a coup.",conservatives

i am not arguing for the moral authority of one civilization over another because that is a fundamentally stupid and ahistoric argument. 

the current racism and structural barriers that modern indigenous people in canada (and the us, and mexico, all the way right on south to tierra del fuego) is absolutely a function of both modern racism and past genocidal violence, whether it is the violence of literally murdering hundreds of people at a time in massacres or whether it was the violence inherent in the state taking children away from their parents and \"reeducating\" them in residential schools. there are indigenous people in canada who are currently suffering as a result of this history, and it is absolutely a right and just thing to take steps to rectify this. we are not arguing about that. furthermore, i agree with you that what trudeau has done so far is absolutely not enough.

the issue here is that the chinese government, and other governments which act in bad faith, have spent the past 20-30 years pushing a bad-faith argument. that argument goes something like this:

1. western countries meddle in our internal affairs when they express concerns about past or ongoing human rights situations in our countries.
2. if they cared so much about human rights, then they need to make amends for their own histories of human rights violations before they criticize us for theirs.
3. they haven't made all those amends yet but criticize us for our human rights violations, therefore they don't really care about human rights at all.
4. therefore this is really all just a ruse to meddle in our internal affairs for political or economic gain.
5. therefore all talk of human rights is really just an amoral ruse to justify keeping us down.

this is a shitty bad-faith argument, but it gets a lot of people stuck at points 2-3. it's absolutely true: western countries absolutely do need to do better domestically to address histories of oppression, genocide, slavery, de facto racial caste systems, etc. but this is inherently not about performative action to \"prove\" that the people of canada are morally better than the people of china. fundamentally, when people call out china's current ongoing genocide of the uighur people it is because china is engaged in mass brutality against the uighurs with the stated intention of destroying them as a people, and we are hoping that we can stop it. it's that last part, that we are hoping to stop the brutality, which is the distinction i'm trying to make here. 

reconciliation will be a long drawn-out process. the process has started. we don't know where that will take us. genocide has lasting negative effects on the people targeted, and i'm going to be totally honest, there is no reasonable amount of justice that can undo that hurt. undertaking that process does not and should not prevent us from also taking a stand on egregious human rights violations abroad, be that against china's mistreatment of the uighurs, saudi arabia's brutality against the houthi in yemen, myanmar's genocide against the rohingya, etc. it should not be construed as an insult to the victims of past genocides that we try to stand up to prevent current genocides.",liberals

trudeau's done nothing about the borders… and neither has ford about the borders over which he has control; his main rebuttal against ottawa's assertion that it didn't need to be locked down on dec 26th was that infected people from quebec would stream over the border in to eastern ontario… and yet he did \\*nothing\\* to protect against that imminent threat. how do you bitch at trudeau about something he controls but then do nothing about something you control? it's easy when you're looking for a scapegoat and an opportunity to heap the blame on someone else.

the lack of testing in airports… well, now people need a negative test to get onto a canada-bound plane, so there's that. should extra testing be done at airports for arrivals? certainly there should… and yet again, in that press conference on dec 21st, ford said if the feds wouldn't do rapid testing at the airports, he would. has he? no. again, all talk against the feds, and no action to help his province.

the feds have a legitimate reason to not shoulder as much responsibility as the provinces, by virtue of the fact that the provinces unilaterally set healthcare policies, education policies, policies on ltcs, etc etc etc. if the feds stepped in (as many think they should apparently, given how responsible they supposedly are for this whole mess), people would be screaming that confederation is being shredded by trudeau dictatorial acts.

are the feds fucking up on vaccines? quite possibly. would alberta, ontario and quebec be so heavily reliant on vaccines to combat the pandemic if their own efforts (with money provided by the feds, btw) weren't so half-assed in the months leading up to now? nope. during the lull of the summer before wave 2 hit, what investments did ab and on make to increase icu capacity? contact tracing? testing capacity? very little. are any of those things federal responsibilities? no. and yet let's blame trudeau when he slow providing them with a silver bullet for problems they themselves created. 

how about the provinces who aren't screaming about a lack of vaccines? what are their situations like? did they invest in icus? testing? tracing? did they institute policies that were proactive in preventing covid from getting into their communities, unlike on, ab and qc? 

it's quite easy to blame the provinces who are fucking up - they're the ones responsible for the mess that they are in right now; anyone who says it's the feds' fault that ontario is at 3,000 new cases a day is an idiot. if ford was proactive and provided any leadership whatsoever in the summer and early fall, we wouldn't be in the mess we're in, and he wouldn't be so desperate for vaccines.",liberals

gworyzy,2021-05-02T03:38:46.000-07:00,"a harper dynasty and the end of the liberals? how the 2011 election didn’t change everything &gt; they've got this rock-solid floor, and a good leader can just build on that.

i think it's largely because conservative voters have no where else to go. for left leaning voters most can stomach voting either liberal or ndp, or liberal and conservative if they're more centrist. 

&gt;i wonder, for example, if something were to happen to rachel notley, what would happen to the ndp in alberta

that's an interesting one, because it also sort of falls into what i was describing above of a perfect scenario. the ndp in alberta initially got in (in my opinion) due in large part to a vote split between two parties for conservative voters. i think they're similarly getting good odds due to how mismanaged the pandemic situation has been in alberta among the other failings of kenney's ilk. i think you're probably right though, if notley retired or some such i don't think they'd have half the pull in votes. for some reason the ndp in general seems to lack a devoted base.

as for ontario, well... a lot of misguided nonsense regarding bob rae that hasn't been relevant in *over two decades* seems to still be an anchor on the ondp. i still can't fathom how doug ford of all people managed to win that election. all i know now is i highly doubt he'll win again. as for the ondp... ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯",liberals
gwosg8r,2021-05-02T03:41:29.000-07:00,"a harper dynasty and the end of the liberals? how the 2011 election didn’t change everything like u/deathorglory83 said, trudeau made his position absolutely clear, while mulcair seemed wishy-washy (on this issue and on others - quebecers care about other issues too!) i think a lot of what happened in quebec re: the centre-left rally around trudeau was similar to what happened elsewhere. more than the niqab issue, more than really anything else, the 2015 election was about the leadership of stephen harper. trudeau's liberals emerged as the stronger and more decisive option to end his premiership, while mulcair's ndp seemed nervous and indecisive.

i also think the niqab issue wasn't as salient in quebec as bill 21, hence why the bloc didn't really surge in 2015 the way they did in 2019, and why the multiculturalist liberals won the most votes and seats in quebec. most french quebecers are uncomfortable with religious symbols, but bill 21 was a quebec law, passed by quebec's legislature, overwhelmingly supported by quebecers, and opposed by ottawa. as far as federal politics is concerned, bill 21 was more about self-determination than religious symbols. whereas the niqab ban was a niche issue brought up by the canadian government regarding canadian citizenship ceremonies. quebecers may have liked the idea, but it didn't have the rallying cry of \"canada wants to stop quebec from preserving its own culture\" like bill 21 did. all the niqab issue really did was that it threw the ndp off-balance and allowed the far superior liberal campaign to make inroads.",liberals

est-ce qu'elle parle français? there's not really a path to recreate something similar to 2011 for the ndp without quebec. notley could bring in a few extra alberta seats and bc seems to have zoomed left since 2011, but they can't make up for quebec. it would take a huge surge in ontario to make up for it, but it's hard to see any ndp leader pulling that off anytime soon.

you also don't need to be a tory to think that the gun ban is poorly orchestrated and complete political bs. they arbitrarily chose some guns and made it a voluntary buyback program ffs. it should 100% be mandatory and any guns not needed for hunting should be banned. as well the handgun ban should be a blanket ban across canada. it was cowardice on the part of the prime minister to pass that responsibility to municipalities to avoid push back from gun nuts.

o'toole is interjecting his own morality into an assessment of objective risk factors, where it does not belong.  that's what makes it unscientific.

prisoners aren't being vaccinated as part of a moral crusade.  once you accept that stopping the spread of the virus is a worthwhile goal, you want to distribute the vaccine according to the area where it has the most impact in stopping the spread - a decision that is guided by science.  prisons are one of those environments.  there's no need to confuse the issue with pointless pedantry.",conservatives
