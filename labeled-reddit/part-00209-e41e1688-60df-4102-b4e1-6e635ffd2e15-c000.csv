h2ywgna,2021-06-24T16:37:14.000-07:00,"cowessess first nation says 751 unmarked graves found near former residential school look. i agree there is a corruption issue that needs to be dealt with, but as one fella told me before; \"we need to get all of this dealt with and out of the way first so that they can get past it themselves. once that is done, then accountability and other anti-corruption measures will actually take hold. not until afterwards, because they will just see it as more meddling, instead of actually helping.\"  


and after a decade passing since he told me that; i agree with him. despite the fact you can find gorgeous properties *surrounding* certain reserves in provinces like saskatchewan, that clearly were the result of misappropriated funds when the rest of the nearby community by comparison looks like a trailer court took a fucking dump on itself in more cases than not.   


it's pretty sad. if the money that was going to them was actually being spent properly, most of their problems economically probably wouldn't exist. so believe me, i agree with you for the most part.   


but because i want to see this problem finally be fucking done and dealt with, i'm willing to do what needs to be done, since letting it continue on and on like it has been for decades now *clearly isn't fucking helping.*   


so. let's just get it done.   


as for how long. that's a damn good question. as a quick thought on the matter, i would say probably roughly until they are all on parity roughly with some of the countries medium to large sized towns, or about 80% of them at least. (failures will exist.) once they have this established, they should be able to support themselves for the most part without as much support from outside.   


but, and this is a big but. you seem to misunderstand something.   


these payments are mostly in regards to contracts from companies, not so much the government. this will affect government agreements too, no doubt; but i have only been speaking of the companies agreements til now. government is a whole other can of worms that, much like my comment up til this point, has a lot to unpack.   


20 years. that's likely how long i think it will take to help them get up caught up to the rest of the world in some form. i also suspect that along with quebec hightailing it, we might see them take manitoba along with nunavut at some point so they actually have some land to call a nation, and not just be a bunch of separate tribes acting as a collective. too landlocked that way. manitoba on the other hand has a lot of history behind it that lends itself to them using it to form a nation.   


sooo... at some point it' s just going to be ontario and the maritimes covering old government debts, since you can bet your whole farm and family that sask, alberta, bc and yukon are sticking around to watch ontario burn itself to the ground. since, let's face it... most of the worst decisions in canadian history all came from ontario ultimately. more precisely ottawa... but that's splitting hairs almost.   


northwest territories will probably be split between nun/man and alberta/yukon. or just joined up to the yukon instead. who knows.   


but that's where i see all this going, if liberals stay in power. and it's about the only way i think the native peoples will be happy at all in the long run. anything less will probably just continue the problems forever.   


canada, will probably cease to exist at that point. if it persists, it will be more like the eu than anything.",liberals

we don't live in a 'workers' society anymore. we live in a 'consumer' society. this is part of why the powers that be don't mind seeing a little bit of inflation. it's not only to be expected, but meant to be there by design. 

if they were to go the full distance with this, they could prop up the economy permanently through raised sales taxes, and a ubi that takes a freidman approach of taking away all other social benefits and lumping it into one single ubi. 

this system relies only sales taxes and not income taxes, ideally. 

seems to me that the government is looking to do something similar with ei, but have been working on a way to do it through this pandemic through crb. not cerb. they claim that was a emergency thing only, and ... i'm going to take their word for it. why? because they don't claim the same for crb. in fact, you'll find them say things like \"exploring the idea\" in regards to ubi and crb, from time to time. 

also worthy of note... the way they have everyone going through ei or crb depending on their situation looks very much to me like they are trying to run the ei well dry before changing the systems in place. why? 

easier to change things if people can't complain about 'their money'. since  it's all spent, now they can change the system however they want. 

of course the way its built means its constantly replenishing through the workforce... but since the workforce is constantly being put on hiatus every few months... 

i imagine we'll see this new ei come about in early 2022. it might even be used as a election platform promise by the liberals this year. 

anyways. yes, stimulus is important. if the economy shutters down because people can't buy anything, then we are absolutely fucked. so stimulus is really fucking important. if anything, the biggest mistake the liberals made, wasn't that they spent a lot of money... it's more-so 'how they spent a lot of money, and to whom'. 

if they had just ignored the usual idiots like bombardier and etc, and just given all that money wasted to the people instead; keynesian economics would have been able to show its strongest hand most effectively during these kinds of times. 

instead, liberals had to pay some of their friends. like always. this pandemic just made it easier for them to do, while giving money to the rest of us consumers to keep consuming. 

i've been doing what i can to be smart about it all. i've got a stockpile of food, getting rent prepaid, and some excess cash for just in case. i've also bought some things to hopefully help in the coming months and years. these things, unlike my real food thus untaxed food; were all electronics and such, so heavily taxed/tariffed/etc.

even if the liberals want him out and are prepared to whip the vote on it, i'm not sure any of the other parties would agree. strategically, it's better for them that the liberals continue to have this little thorn in their side, the riding is a relatively safe liberal seat so there's nothing for them to gain, and they can easily justify not whipping the vote and/or not expelling someone over dropped/unproven charges. the moral culpability threshold for house expulsion is much, much higher than for caucus expulsion.",liberals

this isn't about the charges, some say. he never would have been the lpc candidate if he'd disclosed the charges, so clearly it is about the charges.

vuong was dishonest, some say. i've never heard anyone suggest he was dishonest with voters. more significantly, it's downright ridiculous to suggest that dishonesty is the standard for resignation. should justin trudeau have resigned when he lied about electoral reform? should steven harper have resigned when he lied about cap and trade? they both lied to the public about extremely important matters of policy critical to the nation and the world. i'd say that's more significant than vuong's non-disclosure to his party.

to make a long story short, the identity of the party is not mainstream and it doesn’t want to be, unfortunately this means they are also u likely to achieve the mainstream support they need to govern.

also ngl, the ndp definitely is very scant on details despite constantly claiming they have comprehensive plans. as someone who genuinely studies this stuff it’s suspicious as all hell. i support most of the ndp platform, but their lack of specifics and details about what are massive programs and undertakings, despite having individuals clearly more educated than me is utterly concerning.

i’ve somehow only voted ndp in my life despite this because i live in saskatchewan and the liberals are dead, fuck my local cpc mp, and the sask party is complacent because they know our provincial ndp is an inept opposition. despite that still have votes ndp every election begrudgingly.

first off. you’re quite right about addressable audience. so that’s true. 

second, there’s a huge problem for elections: tiktok is not as far as i am aware c76 compliant. meaning there’s no political ads library, meaning you can’t advertise there in a writ period. so you’re counting on organic reach entirely. a party can pay to hit you with an ad on insta and fb 5 times, in a swing riding only, with a message that is known to be both engaging and effective at driving vote away from the competition and towards that part. on tiktok it’s spray and pray and hope people see your content. journalists and tweens saw them but swing voters only saw the coverage of them. when something is good, you pay so people see it 5-10x on tv and online. on an organic platform you cannot. 

so you are hitting only youths and only in an not-targeted way with content that has a frequency challenge. what about the content?

all the social science research i have ever seen on getting out the vote has all said: focus on voting and not on issues and candidates. remind people when, how, where to vote. remind them it’s a tight election and their vote matters (check out chateauguay), in the states they can also remind voters that while their choice is private, whether they voted or not is a matter of public record. all of these boost turnout. 

telling people you’re really cool and your policies are rad (hello fellow kids) does sweet fuck all for turnout. 

it was a badly run campaign. they relied heavily on some probably effective attack ads run against trudeau. watching a campaign that was entirely negative, and did very poorly at ground game and mobilization, i would say their hidden objective was they want trudeau gone as leader and were ok with losing if that outcome happened. but maybe not. maybe they’re just bad at campaigning.",liberals

case in point, the united church which i believe you said you grew up in.depending on the congregation and pastor, you could end up in a rather conservative church, or alternatively a more progressive one. i had an ex who was a member of a particularly evangelical and conservative congregation... then there are others which are very different. this was in my hometown which is a smaller eastern ontario town/city. in ottawa meanwhile, the united church and the anglican church is considerably more socially liberal than in my hometown.

in 2019 the ndp ran only 14 candidates, won 6% of the vote, and yet still managed to elect 3 completely new members, in 2021 even with all the problems with covid, electoral disruptions, voting issues, questionably enforced rules, delays, etc the party managed to run over twice as many candidates, gained in the popular vote, and keep 2 of it's 3 elected mps. 

she was the only one who wasn't elected and that was against a decent challenger in john abbot (who effectively became a star candidate due to his status as runner up in the liberal leadership campaign earlier that year) by a vote difference of around 50. 

with all the ridiculous outliers effecting the result it's very arguable that ignoring her one seat the ndp have gained more under her then it had under it's previous leader in earle mccurdy.

i firmly believe that abbot's election was if not entirely at least partially due to an outlier with a lot of the issues surrounding the election itself, i've volunteered in the area for the federal election and most of those voters *aren't* hardcore liberals. the district has been effectively for the ndp since the late 80's and mid 90's and even elected coffin herself by over 6000 votes in 2019 in which was her first time running and i firmly believe she could win it back in a less messy scenario.

do i think she should stay? i don't know, but it's not as bad as you're making it out to be.

not sure how closely you were watching during the last year, but the price of materials also doubled, and there was literally a shortage on *fasteners*.

we were building so much, renovating so much, and slowing down production and imports so much, that we literally couldn’t buy *screws and nails*.

100% we need to do something about affordability of housing, but this crisis is being exacerbated by the pandemic and the doubling of prices isn’t inflation, nor is it a supply issue, it’s a short term demand spike caused people millions of people wanting to get the fuck out of plague ridden cities.

hnouoir,2021-12-07T14:34:22.000-08:00,"the woman problem, why the overwhelming majority of women vote left. something about the way you said \"good clean conservative women in politics\" got me thinking about an angle other than the one in my own comment, at least for why there are more women in the liberal party than in the conservative one (though in fairness part of it is just \"it's 2015 so i'm having it 50-50\" justin trudeau, lol, it wasn't like that before hand was it?)

but y'know, many couples have kids. and regardless of all the modernizing we've done, it seems that actually caring for those kids still generally falls disproportionately to women. conservative people tend to more highly value families and doing your work well, and that attitude would spill over into doing your best to be a good parent. so maybe fewer good clean conservative women end up in politics because they value their families more highly than that, especially given how demanding a job in politics would be. perhaps a higher proportion of liberal women would value childlessness, or would be more comfortable sending their kid to a daycare while they worked (financial aspects aside, that is, cos that's another story altogether). i think this could be even more true given that a lot of conservative parents seem to prefer raising their kids themselves so they have good values, and many mainstream places, possibly including daycares and schools, are going more and more woke just in general, which creates even more of a divide and thus even more of an incentive for conservative parents to have at least one parent only working part-time if at all (again, often the woman).

i'm just thinking out loud here, i don't know how much of a factor that is, but it could be a thing.",liberals

many trains in toronto end in a fucking parking lot, if i recall correctly go transit is actually the biggest owner of parking lots in ontario, so no surprise that those trains completely fail at their job of reducing car usage and spurring growth. anywhere else in the world if you exit a train into the station you'll be greeted by pedestrian areas, shopping malls, restaurants or a hub to other forms of mass transit, because basing your mass transit around cars is counter intuitive.",liberals
