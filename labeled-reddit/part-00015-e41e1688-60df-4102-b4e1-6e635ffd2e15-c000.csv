griy31d,2021-03-19T07:27:43.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention i'm always being too kind to the fools when i think this way... but my take is that their 'belief' is not that climate change itself isn't real, but that it's not a real problem.

i imagine most underestimate the issue by thinking that some scientists are noticing small changes in climate today and calling it an imminent global catastrophe because those scientists depend on our collective belief in it being a major problem to secure funding for their research.

what i've heard numerous times on various podcasts and general interest articles is that the data is somewhat vague on the specific consequences of inaction. yes, generally speaking we can say that things will get very very bad if we don't course correct, but just like inaccuracies in predicting the weather, it's not exactly possible to put a date on when societies will collapse due to catastrophic weather events resulting from climate change. it doesn't help that the media is always trying to do this by saying that we only have x years to make a change or else society collapses. some terrible weather events are happening now, but the worst stuff will come later and we can't say exactly when.

my take is that when we had a major hole in our ozone layer, a scientist was able to pull up a simple picture of the globe in the un to say,

\"you see this massive fucking hole in our atmosphere? that's gonna kill us in 10 years unless we collectively stop using cfc's.\" and... for the most part, it worked.

my problem with climate change is that i don't really understand why our reaction isn't so similar to this previous issue that we were able to collectively overcome. maybe the political structure of the world is different, maybe people are slightly more conspiratorial than before, maybe giving up cfc's was slightly inconvenient but giving up cars and oil is too much, or maybe the science is a lot more complicated and has vagueness in ways that the ozone layer issue did not.",conservatives

the limitation of this particular study being, of course, that this only looks at temperatures in the mediterranean area around italy. the medieval warm period was indeed cooler than today, the roman period is roughly the same, *in that area*. 

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

that said, 2000 to 2015 were actually in a very tight band between 0.6 and 0.7 degree temperature range. and that one i was taking some hope from.

the graph from the site you referenced shows that we first hit 0.6 degree abnormality in 1998, before falling back to .4 for 99 and 2000, then from 2001 through 2014 were settled between 0.6 and 0.7. the change actually did level off for a bit with about as many years edging slightly up as edging back down. annnnd then we jumped up again in 2016 and have been above a 0.8 since. so much for the brief reprieve.

i'm not suggesting that the problem has stopped (the last 5 years clearly show otherwise because we're back on the increase again) but for a while there it did look like we'd hit a more stable plateau than we had for several decades.

\\[note this is similar to 1945 through 55 where the temperature actually decreased for a bit before the trend resumed. reason for optimism that was then proved wrong shortly after\\]

neither of these, as i mentioned, address the root cause of this period of warming or the appropriate approach to take. and neither argument should be used to deny that climate change is happening and being accelerated. however, they are useful for another reason, and that is to show that as yet, we aren't radically outside of a range that the planet has been in before and if we act quickly, we should avoid permanent damage to the planet.",conservatives

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2011.02415.x

page 404 of this article from this journal of internal medicine outlines some of the health costs of climate change and yes, they would be society altering. what would the effect be on other forms of life as well?

the likely resultant indirect and more diffuse impacts include: 
delayed health impacts of extreme events⁄disasters: food shortages, epidemics, mental health disorders,etc. 
nutritional (especially child developmental) consequences of declines in: agricultural food yields, causing lowered nutritional quality 
seafood harvests owing to changes inocean temperature, currents and acidity
infectious disease owing to altered water flows and⁄or increases in temperatures leading to contamination of food and water; also, health risks from water shortages (affecting hygiene and sanitation) indirect health impacts of changes in  ecosystems or species that mediate 'zoonotic' borne infectious diseases (malaria,dengue fever,hantaviruses, leishmaniasis, lymedisease, schistosomiasis, henipahvirus, etc.)
health consequences, including mental health disorders,of loss of rural livelihoods, propertyloss, displacement and conflict (overdwindling naturalresources)",conservatives

i'm familiar with the argument that replacing coal with ng reduces emissions (by about 50%), but op is saying that canada supplying more ng could somehow make global emissions go down by \"much more\" than the 0.5-1% that they could with reducing their own emissions. 

let's take \"much more\" to mean at least 2x more (which i think is conservative. i take it to mean more like 5x more, but i want to be fair to op), and assume that ng replacement reduces emissions by 50% compared to coal. this means that canada would have to by itself supply enough ng to replace coal plants currently contributing 1-2% of global emissions . since coal is 40% of global emissions, canada would have to singlehandedly export enough ng on top of what we're already exporting, to shut down 2.5-5% of global coal plants.

i would also like to mention that racism came from both sides as i am mixed. many people have presumed i'm muslim, many black people have presumed i'm black. (i had 3 black kids come up to me at a lake beach one time and asked me if i was black lol).

frankly this whole thing about white privilege and pandering to poc by the liberals pisses me off just as much as outright racists because it doesn't address the issue, and frankly it makes it worse because it makes white people who weren't even racist in the first place become prejudice against me. the other thing is job interviews that ask for my race. i'm like i don't fucking know and i don't care and you shouldn't be hiring me based on such a metric anyhow that's litterally racism. *uhem* my apologies for yelling, i just have a big problem with this one in particular as it's blatant racism being pushed as a solution to racism and it pisses me off as it often hires people who are not qualified for the job simply in the name of \"diversity\". 

also as a side note i've experienced more malicious racism from people who are supposedly devote librals and care about people then i have from more conservative racists. why? well see the old bible thumping racists are very clear about why they don't like me, but they're easy enough to gain the respect of through showing your a man who is well educated and can teach them something, saving them time/money they generally don't treat me very poorly after that. the racists on the left though, no no no, see not only do they hate me, they don't make it obvious, and instead do much more malicious things like block me from taking higher positions of power, and they'll virtue signal using my skin tone as a political pawn that they never follow through on, and what they do do only hurts me more as a poc because they don't actually listen to my real problems. they want to think they know why i struggled to be where i am today because of the skin tone i was born with rather than actually listening to what i have to say about my real struggles.",liberals

gy00kio,2021-05-13T03:20:38.000-07:00,"u.s and them — may 12, 2021 labour is facing long-term issues common to many left-parties such as the loss of its working class base. it's also facing some more unique issue such as the strength of the scottish national party - it's probably not possible for labour to win without scotland. finally, the brexit issue has been very tough for labour since it's quite popular in critical working class seats even as it's very unpopular with the base overall. corbyn tried (and largely failed) to walk this line and starmer appears eager to put it in the past, despite previously calling for a second referendum.

i'd strongly caution against listening to anyone who attributes to decline to corbyn, starmer or any particular leader. these issues predate both and internal labour politics is wildly vindictive so there are a lot of people with an agenda.

a bit of history: contemporary uk labour is quite divided into two camps. one is the more socialist camp, which dominated the party historically. this changed in the 90s with 'new labour' which transformed labour into a much more neoliberalized party, abandoning long-standing demands for nationalizations, for example. the project was an electoral success, however - blair won a large majority. unfortunately, blair's successors had trouble replicating that success and the base was extremely dissatisfied to not only be running on watered-down ideas, but losing on them. this led to the surprise victory of corbyn in the leadership race, which seemingly put the parry back in the hands of the socialists. however, the party elites were extremely not on board with this and basically undermined and opposed him from day one. it's hard to know if a more dynamic politician could have consolidated their power over the labour caucus, but regardless, the party never really accepted the corbyn leadership (even after surprising gains in the 2017 election). i think it was the civil war that really sunk corbyn and after a disappointing election result he stepped down. starmer won that handily. while he is certainly from the moderate wing, starmer isn't directly connected to blair and i think there was some hope that he would be a dynamic leader who might be able to put the internal labour squabbles behind him. unfortunately, that hasn't really been the case and he's proved to be fairly ineffectual against boris as well.

the incredible vindictiveness toward corbyn is a bit puzzling to me. i feel like the best critique of him is simply that he wasn't a particularly charismatic or dynamic leader and ultimately couldn't control his party. outside the uk, he just appears to be a fairly unremarkable, soft-spoken old man - it's almost hard to imagine anyone having such strong feelings about him.

but this is common with intra-party disputes - as the saying goes there is no disagreement like that between two people who almost entirely agree. unfortunately, i think the focus on corbyn was to the detriment of examining labour's more fundamental problems. the recent election results indicate that replacing the man at the top was perhaps not sufficient.  it's really quite concerning - after a decade in power, the brexit debacle and catastrophic covid response, the conservatives have no right to be winning. yet labour has been unable to capitalize and one wonders if the decline is reversible at this point.",conservatives

so if you’re set on trudeau, call your mp make sure they hear what your concerns are and how you’re going to be able to buy a house. effect change within the party to address the problems with the generational wealth gap.",liberals

i have a few points and i'm thankful for your response.

&gt; conservatives are not nazis, but they can become nazi if they feel rejected and the only option to push their right wing views are through violence.

i don't associate conservatism with nazism. nazism politically exists in a completely different spectrum here. and i don't want to automatically lump them all together.

the issue is, in canadian politics, only one party currently has members courting these types of people. that does create an unfortunate link between canadian conservatives and nazism, whether the conservatives or conservatives wish to accept that or not. 

&gt; to avoid this listen to the conservatives, so they feel as if they are heard. just as you would want to feel heard

see above. i have no problem listening to conservatives. as long as they're not repeating the rhetoric that leads to extremism, nor intentionally courting them. i don't believe the conservative party stands beside nazi's. but their are ties with some members.

&gt; when they feel heard when they feel as if though they are able to do something. to help the world through their ideas. when they have hope. just as you would have hope if you were heard. they will have 0 need to become a nazi.

this is sort of victim blaming. \"if you didn't tell the nazi's to go away, they wouldn't be nazi's!\". and it brings us to the paradox of intolerance. when you tolerate intolerance, you allow intolerance to spread. allowing nazi's to voice their opinions allows nazism to spread. giving them the \"its ok to speak your nazi hatred\" will have greatre impact of spreading the hate than if they stewed on their own. which leads to the next point.

&gt; remember those who do the most damage in a fight are often the ones that are the most violent. its not very advisoble to create extremists.

we don't create extremists. and while certain actions might lead to dissolusionment. these people themselves due to one form or another allow themselves to buy into extremism. often because other extremists are already allowed to spread those messages publicly under the guise of \"both sides\" and \"everyone's opinion matters\"

i do have pity for those who fall to extremism. even more so when it's canadians. we are a rich nation who have the means to ensure that every single canadian gets a good education. good access to quality of life to help prevent indoctrination. this is our failing that we let them fall through the cracks.

but just because we failed them, doesn't mean we also allow people to continue to spew hatred and nazi propaganda. at some point we do have to draw a line and say \"this is not appropriate or welcome here\".

i will listen to conservatives. i will always listen to platforms and what other people are feeling. even the nazi's. but at some point you have to ask yourself why does the conservative party in particular get dragged through the mud when these discussions come up?

because there's history and precedence that has already been set. want that to change? than conservatives have to make a concerted effort to remove these cancers from their own midst.",conservatives

we don’t need to imagine. we know what happened with this exact instance. abortions went underground. the people passionate about women’s right to choose found alternative means to provide it. and this raises a fundamental problem and exposes the right which is that their ideas that they are passionate about are almost always oppressive in nature which is why a right wing example of this doesn’t really exist. 

&gt;wait a second........... that is exactly what happened with the blm protests. \"we were not violent, we cried as we saw our friends being hurt, you didnt listen, now do you listen after we burned down your bussiness???\"

this is true to an extent and if right wingers can provide an example of violent oppression and systemic discrimination that rises to the level that sparked blm i don’t know if i’d disagree with their behaviour. the right to oppress other people or stop the progression toward equity among all people is not the same.

this will - and already is - going to bite us in the ass. these policies ultimately insulate the oligarchs that the government chooses to \"win\" in terms of secured markets (jobs). as inflation soars, the boc will make more excuses not to raise rates , as the federal and provincial budgets are hinged on artificially sequestered lending rates, and canadian households are leveraged to the tits.

if we only vaccinate the elderly ones, the less-elderly but medically frail are still at high risk of infection and complications. every one of those inmates that contracts covid and requires hospitalization/icu takes up resources that could be going to your grandmother.

further - csc doesn't have the jurisdiction to vaccinate your granny. you should probably take that issue up with your provincial government, which does. what's holding up her shot has nothing to do with the available does, as those are all sitting in storage waiting to be administered.

this whole issue is just pointless virtue signalling by o'toole. he's well aware that vaccinating or not vaccinating those inmates has absolutely zero effect on when your granny can get her shot, the entire purpose of this discussion is to pretend that this fact isn't the case so that the conservatives can 'get tough' on another marginalized group to the benefit of nobody at all.",conservatives

i'm a young brown guy from ontario. i know what racist scapegoating is, especially when it comes to covid. find any article about high covid rates in peel region, read the comments, and you'll find countless right-wingers taking the chance to blame people who look like me for fucking everything up - never mind that many south asians in peel region are essential workers in hospitals, factories, and the pearson airport, never mind that many first generation indians have terrible pre-existing lung problems because of the near-toxic air quality in parts of india, never mind any of those factors. both east and south asians have had to bear the racist scapegoating of ignorant people who see us as disease carriers, and we know scapegoating when we see it.

stopping international air travel from that part of the world is not that. the covid situation in india is something nowhere in the world has seen yet, and canada's first responsibility is to keep canadians safe. we have to stop air travel from south asia, not because we're racist fearmongers, but because that's perfectly reasonable and rational. trudeau finally banned air travel from india after weeks of pressure, but it was very disappointing that he dragged his feet for so long.

think about it this way. when international travelers from south asia come in, where do they end up? if they're coming to the gta where half of south asian canadians live, they're flying into pearson airport in malton, a heavily south asian community in mississauga. if you've been to pearson, you also know that there are a lot of south asians who work there. and once they arrive, these arrivals are most likely going to be staying in the gta, often with family members. the people who have the most to lose from international travelers coming in from south asia are south asian canadians. so either we force international travelers to quarantine for 14 days, or we just suspend travel from those countries indefinitely. canada's mandatory quarantines have been enforced so loosely, the best option was to stop international travel from south asia for now and prevent the new indian variant from spreading.

the real problem with ford's ads is he's trying to shift blame and attention away from his own government's inability to do anything right. unfortunately, by being slow to act on international travel, trudeau has given ford this ammo. but these ads aren't racist, it makes sense to want to limit travel from countries where covid has gotten truly out of control.",liberals

i'd argue anything or government has the right to do, they have the right to back up with proportional force. does our gov't have the right to imprison citizens for two weeks upon entering the country? perhaps not, but we're in the midst of a public health emergency the likes of which we've never seen in our lifetimes, one that has required sacrifices from all of us. if the courts want to have it on their conscience after they interpret two weeks forced detainment as an unreasonable intrusion on the liberties of those traveling, force them to make that choice - don't force the entire province of ontario into misery because you're scared of losing in court. fear of getting shot down in court sure as hell didn't stop our provincial gov't from fighting the carbon tax tooth and nail.

there's a wide gap between enforcement on entering the country and random stops - the latter is what prompted the police backlash. 

in terms of flight crews, baggage handlers, etc... i know we can't be quite as strict as australia due to our proximity to the states and the integration of our economies, but it should be possible to keep incoming passengers from being in the same room as a lot of these folks. surface transmission is pretty minimal by all accounts. giving crews paid sick days so that they can isolate in the event of exposure... it can be done a lot better than it's currently being done.

honestly i'm fine with changing the names of airports. i was a little annoyed when they changed the skydome to the roger's centre because that's a much less cool name, but i got over it. it also helped that it wasn't built on land my ancestors were removed from via genocide and named after one of the stewards of that genocide, so there's that. i'm not sure what trudeau sr's history with aboriginal people is like, but if some of them have beef with him maybe renaming an airport wouldn't be the hardest thing. it depends on if it's something indigenous people are actually asking for. i think naming airports after pms is tacky but on the list of things i actually care about it's pretty damn low.

having said that there can be little doubt he'll be looking for policies that have broader appeal and reach across the isle. given the pandemic he'll have to look at what resources he has and where to put it - money isn't going to be as available as it was when leslyn was running. but he'll want something.

&gt;http://dennisryoung.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rcmp-atip-response-report-crime-guns-domestically-sourced-june-5-2017.pdf

&gt;they're really spinning hard in that document with how they mix up the display of statistics (50% [of the traced firearms] is used to show domestics, but further along they use 10% [of the total submitted for tracing] for smuggled) and flat out questionable practices (why would a negative trace hit be assumed to be domestic? we have importation, registration, and licensing documents in canada for every firearm so if anything it's an indicator of smuggling).

&gt;what i find interesting, if you look through dennis young's work, is multiple atips have come back negative on information pertaining to various claims by police forces on how many firearms are domestic. they make a claim that most come from local sources, but there's nothing in their systems to back that up.

&gt;as for straw purchasing, here's an up-to-date website (i haven't confirmed any of the information):

&gt;https://www.rangebob.com/canada/canadianlistofpalsellingillegallystrawpurchase.htm

&gt;in all, over the course of over a decade (it used to go back to 2006), not even a blimp in comparison to the number of firearms seized *annually* at the border.

&gt;quite a few come from cops too:

&gt;https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/windsor-police-officers-accused-of-being-dirty-cops-at-a-gun-smuggling-trial-1.4757035

&gt;https://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2014/2014oncj625/2014oncj625.html

&gt;there's also the serious issue with the data collection in the first place, and the very real issue of police forces including \"non-firearms\" in their statistics:

&gt;https://dennisryoung.ca/2018/08/30/toronto-police-release-crime-gun-stats-2007-2017/

&gt;over 1/3 aren't regulated firearms and oversaturate the domestic numbers (because what criminal in their right mind [oxymoron intended] would smuggle a bb gun when they can smuggle a real gun). i'll leave the reasoning blank for why they'd do that. things like paintball guns, airsoft guns, bb guns, fireworks, are considered firearms for some parts of the act but are given an exemption in others. so they're technically right for including them, but very misleading.

&gt;i think all of this, and that article on cbc which also debunked the 50% number, is why we haven't heard the lpc or bill blair tout the 50% figure since c-71.",liberals

take la prairie for example. the ndp won this seat in 2011 with 50% of the vote. in 2015, the liberals won it with 36% of the vote. in 2019, the bloc won it with 41% of the vote.

in quebec, being pro sovereignty doesn't necessarily mean you want independence today. it can means they want to move in that direction. this is part of the reason why the 1995 referendum question was so controversial and the clarity act was needed. a lot of french canadians believe that quebec should slowly move towards a more autonomous quebec without necessarily declaring unilateral independence. in 1995, the referendum question was designed to trick those people into voting oui/yes. 

the pro sovereignty movement has rebounded, but not the unilateral declaration of independence movement. you can think of them as 2 separate factions in the same movement. the slow and steady nationalism route is what the caq campaigned on in the quebec election.",liberals

lots of canadians share this belief. it is by no means unique.  


\\&gt; that's what makes supporting or denying genocide in 2021 all the more disturbing and unacceptable   


you've pivoted your position. genocide denial and supporting the ccp are not the same (mind you, i don't like either), but someone can say \"hey i think it's pretty fucked up what the ccp are doing, but in general i support them because i think they lead to good economic outcomes for the society\". this person doesn't support the specific policy, but does support the ccp. you could say the same about like, trump supporters who just support the man because \"he owns the libs\", but also who are (for cognitive dissonance reasons) not in support of the detention of mexicans at the border. hell, i could clap back at you by arguing that by identifying as a \"canadian\" or a supporter of the trudeau gov't, you inherently support the racist-as-fuck indian act, the rcmp, lack of action on the missing and murder cases, the highway of tears, the disproportionate policing and imprisonment of indigenous bodies, the total lack of respect for treaties bound by oppressed nation-states, the action taken against the wet'su'weten (unceeded, un-negotiated territory, imagine if we sent troops into montana because they didn't want our pipeline), and the horrific continuation of boiled water advisories. by your logic, identifying as a canadian is innately horrific. and even if you were to say, \"but i don't support the gov't\", you had *better* be ready to vote for someone who wants to end all those things... otherwise, who represents canadian values in our political system? does anyone? anyone with the power to change things?  


but i won't, because i don't subscribe to the belief that we can take away people's citizenship or identity based on their political beliefs. we can condemn them, deplatform them, hell, even arrest them (per our constitutional rights), but to define a subset of necessary canadian values and then take away from their identity because of that is way too broad a brush

1) nuclear power is already there in many provinces.  the reason more nuclear power generation isn't being added is cost.  it's just that simple.  and the only incentive to add more is a price on carbon.  otherwise, with renewables and natural gas generation being cheaper, utilities will deploy those.  and that's just fine.  cheaper power will also enable the electrification of transport and building heating much sooner.  

2) airline taxes.  this is a challenging one.  first, international treaties prohibit taxation of fuel used on international flights.  next, we're a large country who already has one of the most heavily taxed aviation sectors in the world.  making flying more expensive won't help the economy.  the real alternative is high speed rail in heavily trafficked air corridors (toronto-ottawa-montreal and calgary-edmonton).  but conservative governments have all been opposed to building public rail infrastructure.  and for some reason the cpc also seems opposed to the canada infrastructure bank pushing public-private partnerships.

3) luxury vehicle tax. how does this help cut emissions?  the problem isn't the cost of a vehicle.  it's the fuel economy.  your idea would see a tesla roadster taxed more than an f150.  that's absurd.

4) regional carbon tax.  how is this different than what the liberals are doing by letting each province implement either cap-and-trade or carbon tax as long as it is compliant with the national floor price?  if this is getting rid of the national floor, how is carbon leakage countered?

i would argue the best thing the cpc could do is argue for a complete elimination of all consumer subsidies.  no $5k cheques for evs.  keep the carbon tax and make the current policy truly national.  no different policies by province.  tinker with the carbon price if necessary.  push public spending from social programs to infrastructure.  a tax cut isn't going to provide rural broadband or high speed rail.  government will have to do this.",liberals

1. the idea of climate change is based on hubris; the world is god's creation, and for man to assume he can affect it in any appreciable way is an error of pride.
2. god gave man dominion over the earth and (in the kjv) commanded him to subdue it. that is, the earth is there for our use and to not use it is tantamount to a sin against god.

my position is a bit more nuanced than that. i don't think state secularism necessarily means the destruction of all signs of religion from everything. i just think it's fantastically hypocritical to consider a government employee wearing what is obviously personal religious garb as a transgression against secularism while maintaining public taxpayer funded symbols of religion. even if you say it's cultural and not religious, it's entirety possible for an individual to wear religious garb to maintain a cultural connection while not being super religious.

to add to that, my issue with the \"it's culture not religion\" argument when it comes to public monument is that it is based in historical racism. the reason there aren't many long standing monuments to other cultures and religion in canada is due to the historical fact of racist immigration laws that meant that really only white christians could set down roots and influence culture in a meaningful way. what the argument boils down to is \"we were here first so our religious symbols are culture now\" which by definition rules out any non christian religious trappings from canadian or québec culture on the basis of race.",liberals

gxn7bo6,2021-05-10T05:29:52.000-07:00,"minister backtracks comments on bill c-10, says social media users 'will never' be regulated &gt; the powers are strictly for discoverability

this is far from the truth. section 10(1)(c) of the broadcasting act gives the crtc the ability to regulate programming under the purview of section 3(1). the amended section 2(1) expands the definition of \"broadcasting\" and \"broadcasting undertaking\" to include online/on demand content. it is by these exact same sections that the crtc is allowed to create and enforce programming content on television. this extends beyond \"cancon\" and into areas that regulate depictions of violence, sports blackouts, political fairness, and so on.

you have often insisted that c-10 is limited to discoverability and that there needs to be another bill drafted for the crtc to regulate programming content. frankly, i have yet to see any demonstrable evidence for this claim, other than the fact that the liberals have insinuated interest in drafting a bill to suppress the extremism and misinformation that often circulates online. 

(for a view of what the crtc currently regulates for programming, see here: https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/television/program/)

for posterity's sake, here are sections of the broadcasting act (with the c-10 amendments) that i listed:

&gt; **definitions**
