the next question is how to get from 36% to 40% or more. if the rest of the world moves aggressively on climate policy, including a large-scale switch to electric vehicles, that'll result in lower global oil demand and therefore lower canadian oil production.

as a simple observer to alberta politics from far-away new brunswick, i did remember looking at the various 2019 platforms and finding the ndp one particularly bland. the alberta liberals one did strike me as a lot bolder... in fact, as a strongly left social democrat, it's the only liberal platform anywhere in canada that i've actually liked. 

what's unfortunate about this is that the ndp base wants most of the things you've mentioned (electoral reform, universal dental care, hst, etc). but for concerns of electability (which i think are unfounded) the party has watered down their platform. it's a shame because they've implemented bold stuff like the 15$ minimum wage but they've drawn the wrong conclusions for their losses and appear afraid to rock the boat too much now. yet i do think they could have performed better in 2019 with a more inspiring campaign, and i think they could win big in 2023 with bolder policy points.

if legal gun owners were constantly running the streets on rampages, we'd notice. look at the news: they haven't.

we have strict gun control. the real problem now lies with solving the violence caused by two groups sitting *outside* the firearms act: the criminals who don't obey the laws, and the police to whom it doesn't apply.

the man caught in the eastern townships of quebec last week represents a neglected part of the problem. he was intercepted attempting to smuggle 249 handguns into the country. unless conditions change dramatically, we can expect the us to remain a sources of illegal firearms in the future. the laws are strict already. we now need to step up and increase enforcement.  until we do, this will be nothing but political theatre.

another problem are the cops. during the chase for the gunman (who used smuggled guns, btw) in nova scotia, two officers shot up a building without care for the consequences. this sort of insanity would be illegal for a regular citizen. we've imposed strict rules on citizens owning guns: cops now need to be reined in.",liberals

another issue is ford. ontario has a long time habit of favoring a different party federally than it has provincially as a trend. they had liberal gov'ts through harper's time, and they've had conservative gov'ts through justin's time. i don't know why, and i doubt it's entirely conscious, but it's a thing. so that's a barrier to overcome. it can be done but it's a little more uphill. 

it's good that he's starting to take it more seriously - but what he needs to do more than anything is broadcast a clear vision of what a \"conservative gov't\" is and how canada will be better for it. he cannot win by announcing a policy here and there that he thinks people will like as scheer did. and he cannot win pandering to select groups of the base.  he's got to say \"this is what a conservative canada looks like, and why it's better'.  conservative canada will have more business and more opportunity, and not just by lowering taxes. conservative canada will empower the provinces so that people who live there can choose how they want to live, not be told how to live. conservative canada will make it easier for families to raise their kids and for kids to learn and to play sports etc. conservative canada believes in immigration but also believes that the people we welcome should be strong contributers and that there should be a system of integration and we can't bring in more than that system can handle. etc etc

the feds also recently proposed to improve a disaster program for farmers, but the prairie provinces refused out of political spite. since the program is cost-shared between province and the feds, the prairies refusal means no province gets these improvements even though it was supported by everyone else.

i don't like this trend of pm's (and their staff) appearing to be the sole powers in government, having ministers seemingly there just to throw under busses as sacrificial lambs during times of scandle.

i think the best check we have against the pmo becoming temporary dictators is the members of parliment. if a pm truly goes too far down that road, the members of their caucus can end their term whip or no whip. even a pm with a majority government can be brought down via a non confidence vote if enough of their party members turn on them in a confidance vote.

 the senete can stall/kill bad bills, but can't end a pms term, and i don't think canadians would take a gov. gen doing anything that is not cerimonial.

so i think mps are still vital to our democracy, and the more i think about it, the first question we should ask of any candidate is \"if enough of your constitutes demand it, will you vote against your leader to protect our intrests\"

most will likley lie, but if enough of the voting public demand more, and actually punish mps unfaithful to their electorate, things may slowly swing back to mps having more power vs the pmo, as their jobs could depend on it.",liberals

we wouldn't argue that forcing a parent to work in order to feed, clothe, and house their child is slavery, because we recognize that a child is a person and that the parents have a duty of care to their child. so if we accept that a zygote (and thereby also a fetus) is a person, it's hard to argue that forcing a woman to carry that person to term is torture, because the mother has a duty of care to her (unborn) child.

personally, i don't think that a fetus in early stages of development is a person, because to be a person you have to have a functioning brain capable of some level of awareness. therefore, abortion is not killing a person, and is not murder, but rather a medical procedure to prevent a person being created. but i can still understand where the other side is coming from based on the assumptions they're starting with, and i think understanding that logic is necessary to change peoples' minds and defend abortion rights.",conservatives

this is not universally agreed among denominations. the old testament is quite clear that causing a miscarriage or abortion is *not* murder (murder has the death penalty, but causing a miscarriage only carries a fine under biblical law). english common law also took this position in the medieval period.

medieval church law only considered abortion to be homicide after the ‘quickening’, the point in fetal development where its movement is perceptible. st augustine, bede, st thomas aquinas, and pope gregory xiv were all agreed on this as being the point at which the fetus becomes a person with a soul. the focus on life beginning at conception became mainstream around the 19th century.",conservatives

but i don't think it will reach that point. this reminds of me of the uk labour party in the 1980s under michael foot. back then the left wing fringe, embodied in militant, was wildly successful in wresting control of a lot of the party machinery, and foot's inadequacies (or perhaps his sympathies) gave militant a lot of vacuum to fill. members of the labour's right split off and formed the sdp (the ancestor to the modern liberal democratic party). in the end, it was neil kinnock, when he became leader, who started wielding the axe, banning militant, which he quite rightly regarded as an external insurgency bent on a mainline british political party. while people praise tony blair for bringing in new labour and defeating the tories, it was really kinnock who laid the groundwork but imposing a certain amount of solidarity on the party. that meant sacrificing some of the \"grass roots\" notions that labour had so long espoused as marking it different.

now obviously the british labour party and the conservative party of canada are ideological opposites, but the lessons here are clear. both parties have experienced external actors trying to crash in at the riding level, seize the levers from there, and then get their policies on the floor, and more importantly their people, into positions of power. it's the flaw in a grass roots party, and it's why the us republican party, with none of the actual centralized management machinery of british and canadian political parties, has fallen to a trumpist insurgency.

literally nobody has ever tried to do something like that in the modern era, because it would be insane to try it. amphibious operations are dicey in the best of times due to how many advantages the defenders have. the farthest anyone tries to do it is down and island chain or across a channel, not across a full ocean.

assume they achieve the impossible and take vancouver by storm and get the major port they need. the land force they have on hand isn't the full might of the russian army that would outnumber the canadians. its what can be sustained by a supply line from european russian industry that goes across eurasia on the trans-siberian railway, to a pacific port, across the pacific on what shipping they are able to muster. their next task is to cross 1000km of hostile mountains before they can reach the plains. canadian logistics are minimally impaired and raise light infantry en masse to hold this ground. the heartland of canadian population and industry is still a full continent away from them and can't be reached by conventional means. if this hair brained scheme doesn't by some miracle die at the landing stage, it dies here, insurmountable logistical problems while fighting an industrialised country in incredibly defendable terrain.

a transoceanic invasion by either russia or china is impossible to pull off and all the relevant parties know it, which is why not much is done to prepare for the possibility. the american alliance is secondary. geography already secures us amply.",conservatives

&gt; the surplus was heavily reduced by the nep, which, in turn, stymied many of lougheed's policies for economic diversification to reduce alberta's dependence on the cyclical energy industry, such as the alberta heritage savings trust fund, and also left the province with an infrastructure deficit. in particular, the alberta heritage fund was meant to save as much of the earnings during high oil prices to act as a \"rainy day\" cushion if oil prices collapsed because of the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. the nep was one reason that the fund failed to grow to its full potential

that's pretty salient to today. so the nep sapped alberta of a ton of funds in the 70's, and then the 80's was a massive recession in alberta. i mean honestly of course people hated them ,i wouldn't vote for a party that did that today.

not only would that type of leader be more appealing to the general population, i share your view that it would be electorally smart. to make gains, the ideal cpc leader has to understand all parts of canada, not just alberta and saskatchewan. someone either from québec or possessing a deep understanding of québec would allow the party to take advantage of that untapped potential and be competitive in overlapping federal-provincial caq seats. an autonomous bent would sell in western canada + québec, and if done right, possibly in atlantic canada. just as long as the cpc leader stops pitting one region against another and acts like an aspiring prime minister for all canadians, not just certain parts of the country. 

for the record...as a staunch social democrat who has been an ndp member in the past, and currently a green member... i would totally vote for someone like legault federally if it were an option. i want a prime minister with sound politics and a national vision. if a future cpc leader (or from any party, really) can show me that they care as much about canada as legault cares about québec, and present a winning coalition that's respectful of all of canada, i'm in.",conservatives

&gt;katie telford thinks it gives us cover in the business community and the legal community and that it would allow the prime minister to say we were doing something.

&gt;she was like, “if jody is nervous, we would, of course, line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.”

that said, it's not something that's particularly surprising - political parties of all stripes have a plethora of people with party connections etc to write op-eds to support the position proposed by their party/oppose the position proposed by another at any given time.  the door swings both ways of course, and often columnists who write favourable things towards a certain party eventually get hired by them.

there's nothing necessarily wrong with journalist having political opinions, or for that matter joining the party that professes to hold similar beliefs.  often it's their close personal connections to party insiders that allows them to get the inside scoop on a developing story after all.

gqebb07,2021-03-09T09:21:19.000-08:00,"trudeau says now is not the time to talk about scrapping the monarchy there are a few other options you could try. 

the president of south africa is directly elected and revocable by the national assembly of south africa, with a maximum term of 10 years. the chief justice presides over votes to elect and remove them. 

the president can veto a bill but a second absolute majority vote (so if 338 mps, 170 can pass) passes it again. they can also send bills passed by parliament to the courts for what we in canada call reference questions.

as for the option of using the speaker, they have in some countries some important powers that are technically the prerogatives of the monarch or the gg in canada, such as in spain where they sign the order (along with the king) to dissolve parliament. in sweden, they appoint and remove the prime minister upon the relevant votes in parliament. 

the parliament as a whole or a fraction of it could have powers that could substitute for the judgement of the president or head of state. german state legislatures themselves control the dissolution of themselves, other than automatic dissolutions at the end of their terms. in sweden, if 10% of the members of parliament say that a bill is restricting rights, it is delayed for a year unless 2/3 of the members say that it is fine, with the option of going to court to argue over it. a similar minority or petition of the people could plausibly cause there to be a reference question the way that a president might exercise those powers. 

the territorial legislature of nunavut and northwest territories elect the premier by secret ballot, and the state legislatures of germany do this as well with runoffs as necessary if nobody gets an absolute majority, with a constructive vote of no confidence to replace them so there is no need for the judgement of a head of state if you decide to dispense with them.",liberals

what did peter mackay do? he broke a promise he made to david orchard and the red tories and went and merged the parties anyway. what did he do afterward? he became the 2ic of the tories and decided he wouldn't run for leadership. he held a number of positions and then he quit. he came back during the leadership and ran a very selfish and very entitled sounding campaign; that somehow he deserved it. what happened after he lost? he decided he wasn't going to run again after all. i guess it really was about power for peter mackay. 

peter and erin are both sons of politicians and lawyers. they are a lot more alike than people give them credit for. 

at least you can say stephen harper was principled to some extent. peter mackay meanwhile is a liar and a power-hungry son of a politician. 

i don't think it's really clear at this point who stephen harper's successor is. jason kenney could have been but he went provincial and i don't think he'll ever manage to be leader of the federal tories because of his premiership. maxime bernier was incredibly divisive but he had a brand to him unlike anyone else in the party had, but he went nuts and self-destructed his career. pierre poilievre has quite the national profile amongst conservatives these days, but he's a pretty divisive character and a lot of people do not like him. 

with all that said though, erin o'toole still hasn't had federal election as national leader yet. what's more andrew scheer had managed to grow the party and allowed the party to win a plurality of votes. there are plenty of angles that one could take about scheer's performance, but we often take the dismissive one. we'll never know just how well scheer would be doing right now, but for all we know erin o'toole improves and manages to win an election at some point. look, i don't think they are as capable as stephen harper, but there are still paths to victory for them, if they can handle the internal battles.",conservatives

so lets say they did, the us response would overwhelming and would leave europe a smoking pile of radioactive slag. europe can deploy around 500 warheads but not all those warheads are available at all times, their warheads are spread between 4 uk and 4 french ssbns and not all are at sea at any given time. the us has 14 ohio class subs with columbia class in development, they carry far more firepower than their european counterparts. this doesn't take into account the us bomber and icbm fleet. europe would never risk itself for us, they'd protest and then go back to worrying about russia since they've lost american military backup.",liberals

uhh, the question is one of allocating scarce goods (vaccines) across a population. deciding that one group is more vulnerable and thus a higher priority (as opposed to believing they are just less morally worthy and thus less worthy of care) is what i believe. whereas o'toole's clearly thinks that prisoners (those convicted of a crime and interred in a federally managed facility) are less worthy.

we do have to accept that \"the exact same standard of care\" is impossible when vaccines are so scarce. some people are going to get the vaccine before others. that's the reality of both scarce vaccines and the inherent sequential nature of administering millions of vaccine doses to millions of people. the sequence ought to not to be grounded based on 'how offended we are with someone or their behaviour,' but instead on the public benefit we derive from that sequence.

the ironic thing about the comment i was responding to is the conflation between prisons (federal facilities where all inmates have been convicted of a crime and received a sentence) and jails (provincial facilities where people are held in remand, waiting for a bailing hearing or been sentenced to a crime where the sentence is two years less a day) also conflates the jurisdictional distinction between the facilities. the feds have no authority over when people in jails (by which i mean provincially regulated facilities -- i hope you get the point by now) are vaccinated. that makes o'toole's intervention a bit more meaningless.",conservatives

this does even less than the recent prosecutorial directive in moving toward decriminalization. prosecutors simply have to consider whether alternative measures are appropriate or not, based on the following general principles:

\" **(a)** problematic substance use should be addressed primarily as a health and social issue;

**(b)** interventions should be founded on evidence-based best practices and should aim to protect the health, dignity and human rights of individuals who use drugs and to reduce harm to those individuals, their families and their communities;

**(c)** criminal sanctions imposed in respect of the possession of drugs for personal use can increase the stigma associated with drug use and are not consistent with established public health evidence;

**(d)** interventions should address the root causes of problematic substance use, including by encouraging measures such as education, treatment, aftercare, rehabilitation and social reintegration; and

**(e)** judicial resources are more appropriately used in relation to offences that pose a risk to public safety.\"

if they still think a prosecution is warranted, they can go ahead and prosecute. if prosecutors in quebec and new brunswick were ignoring the earlier prosecutorial directive, there is nothing here that will force them to change their tactics.

we have to find someone else to put on our coins...this one is super easy.

we have to formally have someone sign off o make bills into laws.  this one is more complicated as there is a good reason why the pm doesn't do it now,  i don't know the reasons but it probably has to do with how technically he proposes most of them and he isn't far enough away to get rid of conflicts of interest.  this also eliminates the speaker of the house.  for good reason i don't think we want our top judge signing off on laws that they may later find unconstitutional...and i don't think we want judicial review before every law is passed.  i think this one is solvable but my best answer isn't very good (attaching the speakers signature).

the big issue though has to do with calling elections.  the crown and her reps are non partisan and it is important that the executive doesn't have the final say in when an election happens.  the bc liberals tried to have a second election in 2017 (when they couldn't get confidence of the legislature) but the lieutenant governor instead gave the ndp a shot.  i guess it could also happen where a majority party was doing some very obviously super bad policy and the gg could call an election to check their mandate as well.

- removing fossil fuels from transportation. that means massive increase of public transit, electric cars and bicycling to replace existing automobile traffic. electrification of railroads and increase in their capacity to displace long-haul trucking. supplanting medium-range air travel with hsr and decreasing long-range air travel with more aggressive carbon taxes

- removing fossil fuels from home heating. that means massive conversion of homes and businesses to electric heating. huge project but better started sooner than later.

gmv5ma9,2021-02-10T05:36:10.000-08:00,"trudeau pledges $14.9b for public transit projects  i used to be on the same page as you! i actually interned at via rail as a mechanical engineer a few years ago and they explained why high speed rail isn't really that feasible even in the windsor-qc corridor.

so the main issue right now is that there is no reason to take the train over your car. if i can drive from montreal to toronto in roughly the same time as the train, why would i take the train? furthermore, once i get there i can't get around as easily without it, so even if we implement high speed rail and i can do the journey in 2 hours, i'll probably lose all that gained time in public transit. that means nobody who has the choice will take it. the competition is not against the car. the car will almost always win in north america as long as the local transit situation is the same.

the real competition is against air travel. the customer here becomes mostly business related travelers because they are usually not allowed to drive because the company usually has to pay per km and the employee can't work at the same time. that being said, the train is only competitive at distances less than 500km when you factor in time to get to city center from the airport. however, currently with the advent of video conferencing during the pandemic, it's unclear how business travel will be affected in the future, so financing big expensive projects on an unknown is really challenging. 

furthermore, the cost would be enourmous... way more than the money allocated here. easily a few tens of billions because we currently own so little of the infrastructure required to build it. all trains currently run on cn and cp tracks and these make up the vast majority of delays of via trains. on our current infrastructure, the trains can go up to 160km/h making the mtl-to trip only about 3 hours, but the trains often have to wait for freight. 

here's what would give us the most bang for our buck:

first, we should focus on legislating priority for passengers over freight. currently, the freight companies have the right to slow down passenger trains to let freight through. this is not the case in countries with good rail transport. this could keep our trains at their top speed longer. this costs very little overall.

second, we need to electrify the high density corridors to reduce the operation costs. this is controversial because it is expensive upfront, but these trains burn easily 5-7l/km and if we want to increase speed or frequency, the operating cost doesn't change as much with electric. plus, electric trains accelerate quicker, last longer and typically spread their weight out better and put less wear on the tracks as a result. maintenance and fuel make up a huge part of via's budget, so reducing it while reducing emissions is a win win. this however, may be difficult without dedicated tracks. electrification costs about $10m per km, plus building a whole new line if the freight companies don't allow catenaries overhead (although, if you could convince them that they could run freight on electricity with dual mode locomotives, maybe...)

lastly, the goal should be to optimize the system better for their actual use. for example. running more express trains should be prioritized. most people are not going montreal to napanee, so trains should be primarily city to city with few stops in between that change for each train. so no train takes more than 4 hours to do mtl-to but still gives service to all stations. this requires electrification to reduce the cost of sending more trains. this costs the salary for more engineers to drive the train, plus some ai to better plan the trips. did someone say transit on demand?  [(good read if you want to know more)](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/costofliving/the-long-road-to-economic-recovery-and-the-roads-mass-transit-is-taking-now-and-in-the-future-1.5825218/missing-the-bus-schedule-how-the-pandemic-is-boosting-on-demand-transit-1.5825221)

so that's why i believe the financing of local projects is more important than high speed rail. without excellent local transit, non-business travellers will seldomly choose the train over their car if it's available. we can also improve more trips overall this way while still making intercity travel by train more attractive. 

fun fact, the via rail lrc cars used to be capable of tilting so they could be more comfortable at high speed and to reduce track wear... they sucked though so they scrapped the locomotives (they came as a set) and they locked the tilt mechanism. also the renaissance cars were not made for canada and as such have to be plugged in in winter to prevent hoses from freezing. i could go on...",liberals

&gt;that's his larger point and no one is commenting on it. i presume then that everyone agrees with his point that the lpc has given up on transparency. (which, to be fair, seems kind of obvious at this point and it was something predicted from the beginning. every prime minister who has come in promising transparency and openness changes their tune and it becomes obvious that they only mean that they other side should be transparent, but they themselves are trustworthy enough that everyone should accept their secrecy... because it's different when they do it.)

if you’re going to make comments on what “no one” here is commenting on, then you might want to make the effort to read the comments here. i have commented on it here. there were three major consultations in advance of this bill, and it is being studied at the heritage committee currently.

but if you're talking about people who want a government that balances its budget and invests taxpayer money responsibly, that looks at long-term trends rather than the next 3 months or 4 years, that pays attention to the lessons we've learned from the past and applies them to our current problems, then yes, absolutely. 

we support protecting our food security and becoming more self-reliant, investing in our rural communities and infrastructure, careful stewardship of our natural resources so we don't waste them. we support stable funding for municipalities to support decision-making at the local community level, instead of ottawa arbitrarily deciding what the rest of the country needs every time they want to hand out a pile of cash. we support investments in preventive care to save our healthcare system money, and investments in senior care so our seniors can live in their communities as long as possible. there are plenty of things that progressives and conservatives should be able to agree on- and we used to have a party willing to explicitly call itself progressive conservative because of that. 

it's important to remember that conservatives today don't really have that much resemblance to small-c conservatism. conservatism is about protecting the social and physical structures we've built, about protecting families and society in a changing world. it's about not spending beyond our means. but the policies of today's conservative party will destabilize our society and put canadians at risk. the green party is about planning for our long-term future, not just the next 4 years. it's about responsible investment in our infrastructure and careful stewardship of our resources- so that both will be around when our grandchildren have to make their own decisions. that's an alignment and attitude that resonates with small-c conservatives. 

remember, sustainability used to be called conservation- protecting the environment we live in from being squandered for short-term profits. farmers understand that need. retirees understand that need. immigrants understand that need. the progressive conservatives used to understand that need. the modern conservative party no longer seems to, and its voters who still do need a family to come home to.",conservatives

of course i think it's a good idea, i just don't think the government censoring speech is the right way to do it. i don't trust that the buck will stop with racism once the power is granted.

&gt;we're talking about ensuring our charter rights of equity are enforced by limiting the right to freedom of expression, which is a limiting ability that was built into the charter for this reason.

i'm from quebec, we didn't sign that nonsense and i'm glad we didn't in times like this. what good is a right if it has a bunch of terms and conditions that could negate it in its entirety.

you can already report racist crap since social media has terms of service and guess what, you can call the cops if you see anyone doing anything illegal like advocating for violence or whatnot. i do not support censorship by the government by any means. anti-discrimination laws are something i support, which i see as not being helped by censorship. as i stated before, once the government gains power over a social policy it is rarely forfeited and used minimally. saying \"i hate [ethnicity]\" is hate speech, we all agree on that. but is saying \"i hate the conservative party of canada\" hate speech? i don't think so, but a conservative government will view it as that. \"you hate a party over a third of canadians voted for, you are a hate spreader! you hate your fellow canadians!\" is something that i could see easily as being pushed. think i'm being paranoid? move to china and write how the government sucks on wechat. your door will have someone knocking soon. just because things here are fine does not mean they can't turn bad, historical progress is not linear, things change. these poll results are already proof that we are backsliding. 

&gt;eventually white people will be a minority in canada. don't you think there should be a precedent for preventing the future non-white majority from inciting hatred against white people? don't be so short sighted.

what are you talking about???

also, i don't personally care if some idiot on twitter says \"fuck white people\" even if it gets a lot of likes, but if some business doesn't hire/serve someone because they're white (whatever that even means, wtf does a romanian immigrant and a dude that could trace his ancestry in quebec to the 1700s have in common?), that's wrong and the business should be prosecuted. you can report racism on social media if it bothers you when people shit on white people, which as i stated earlier, is fine.

if you or anyone here is interpreting **anything** i'm saying as \"racism is good\", you are strawmanning my opinion and being completely dishonest. racism is wrong, full stop. doesn't mean i have to support this crap. \"you're either with us or against us\" is a fallacy for a reason. you can hate racism with the fury of a thousand suns and be against censorship.

\"in the j&amp;j trial, the placebo group had 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths from covid-19, whereas the vaccine group had none, which means the vaccine provided 100 percent efficacy against hospitalizations and deaths.

for severe disease, which includes people who were sick enough with covid-19 to require medical intervention but recovered without hospitalization, the efficacy was about 85 percent across the board in brazil, south africa and the u.s.

including mild and moderate disease, the overall efficacy was 66 percent, but varied across the regions: 72 percent in the u.s., 64 percent in south africa, and 61 percent in brazil. “mild and moderate outcomes” could include a range of illness, said gandhi, and we won’t know the details until the full trial results are published, but we do know that everyone recovered without medical intervention.
