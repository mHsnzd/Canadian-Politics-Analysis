not in quebec. plenty of leftists are fully supportive of it (i am not one of them).

2. clicks are everything, and once a narrative gets going, following it helps you get clicks

3. holding an unnecessary election while the pandemic is ongoing *does* tick some people off, and the people who are most likely to be ticked off are probably the politically engaged, who count journalists amongst their flock. 

4. the liberals really did seem to come out of the gate slow compared to the other parties. they're campaigning as much as anyone else at this point, but the first couple of days let a dangerous narrative set in, one that lines up nicely with thinking the election is an unneccesary cynical play, and with pre-conceived notions of liberal arrogance that the party always needs to be careful to steer clear of.

5. no big gaffes from the opposition to talk about. not *nothing*, but nothing but enough to dominate the headlines.

they've had six years and done nothing and for that reason i come from an extremely skeptical place.

building 350k homes a year is a great start. we built 200k homes a year in the 1970s when the population of canada was 20mm. that's around the level we should be building, but we probably need even more to make up for a 40 year backlog. it also needs to be flushed out with a plan to build infrastructure *quickly* and not at canadian timelines to support the new housing. 

rent to buy has been [tried in the uk.](https://hoa.org.uk/advice/guides-for-homeowners/i-am-buying/rent-to-buy/) it is a good scheme, the lpc is going to have to avoid their aversion to helping \"rich\" people for it to actually help in expensive cities however.

banning foreign buyers would be marginally helpful but is politically popular.

it's a good plan. i like it. it doesn't go as far as i'd hope but you can't get everything you want. it's a better plan right now than the ndp's or the cpc's.

your language has shifted here in an interesting way.

first of all, \"deficits cause inflation\" is not in fact universally agreed-upon.  contemporary economics puts responsibility for inflation at the feet of a central bank, and generally speaking there's a strong belief in monetary offset.  as a positive example of monetary offset, this is how canada brought its deficit under control in the 90s without sparking a massive recession: bank of canada interest rates fell substantially over the period.

second, \"deficits cause inflation\" and \"deficits don't work\" (depending on your views on monetary offset) ultimately speak of _permanent_ deficits.  once again, canada is an instructive example, running with a balanced budget or surplus in the early 00's without a different economic trend than more deficit-y times.

cerb, however, is manifestly a *temporary* deficit.  the liberals have already restricted the cerb successor programs, and they will ultimately end.  the strongest interpretations of the [permanent income hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/permanent_income_hypothesis) suggest that even temporary deficits should have no effect on economic output, so evidence that cerb has caused inflation or lessened a covid-recession would in fact be very interesting and generally supportive of fiscal stimulus to manage economic downturns.  (that is to say: it would be a point in favour of old, classical keynesianism.)

that being said, it's not in fact obvious that cerb has caused inflation.  canada's cpi is very comparable to peer nations like the united states which had different covid policy responses of different magnitudes.  

the supply chain argument, however, provides a more consistent explanation of global inflation.  demand-caused inflation implicitly relies on the idea that consumer preferences and available supply vary slowly.  a large, sudden shift in preferences can drive inflation through simple supply/demand effects even if the total level of aggregate demand remains the same.  again, the correct policy response is not obvious.  should governments ignore the shift in the price level as a fundamentally temporary phenomenon, or should they restrict aggregate demand to follow a price-level trend notwithstanding the shift of preferences?",liberals

the state of canadian conservatism is embarrassing. thats because canadian conservatism isn't really conservatism at all but instead more like a watered down version of liberalism, hence the \"liberal lite\" nickname. actual conservative policy, either on the social or economic front, disappeared a long time ago. 

but this largely a situation of their own making. to borrow a quote from andrew breitbart:
\"politics is the downstream of culture.\" 

canadian conservatism signed its own death warrant when it somehow decided that social conservatism was no longer worth fighting for and that the party had to focus exclusively on jobs, taxes, and economic issues, because social issues are \"divisive\" and \"unpopular\" and that they don't \"win elections.\"

brian mulroney pathetically stood by and watched abortion be legalized without lifting so much as a finger in protest. he also did not challenge the growing notion of \"multiculturalism\" as a national ethos. he did nothing. lets focus on free trade. 

stephen harper watched the left destroy the traditional meaning of marriage, introduce all sorts of draconian anti free speech laws, the ballooning of the size of government, and massive and irresponsible immigration. yet he did nothing. a bit of tax cuts here and some tax credits there. 

the result? the culture was completely ceded to the left to make in their own image, and they made a culture that is so progressive that the mere mention of conservatism elicits nothing but contempt. the overton window moved far to the left and conservatives stood by and watched it happen. 

i find it absolutely shocking and pathetic that canadian conservatives abhor social conservatism the way they do. social conservatism is not some bible thumping women and minority hating ideology. it is genuine concern about the health and wellbeing of society, and the belief that traditional institutions and values are best fit to benefit society for the future. but somehow this has been warped to hating women and gays. pathetic. 

economic conservatism hasn't been much better either. taxes are still too high, supply management is still a thing, regulations are excessive, protectionism is rampant, the quality of healthcare has declined, housing is unaffordable, and the cost of living keeps going up while wages stay flat. and this was all being felt pre covid. 

at this point, i'm not sure what can be done. but that being said, i would much rather lose on my own terms than win and govern like a coward. either we fight tooth and nail for our beliefs, and actually start making the hard af work needed to change our culture and economy in a more conservative direction, or canada will not get better and we will not look forward to anything more than liberal lite once a generation.

its hard. it sucks. but its the truth.

this is a relatively common position amongst reserve natives. i mean, there are even rules about marrying outside of the tribe in some cases. the mohawk straight up banned marriage outside of their tribe, if you do so, you get removed from the reserve, lose your house and all your stuff. i've even seen the term miscegenation favourably come up (race mixing term courtesy the kkk). ever seen how a 'half breed' (another kkk favourite term) gets treated on the reserve? it is rough. if they are allowed to stay at all.

canadian laws are written wrt native bloodlines, not tribal membership. just blood. we even follow the 'single drop' idea popularized by the kkk.

at one point trudeau sr. wanted to end the racial segregation, wrote a paper on it and the most popular native reaction was to write a paper of their own, calling it the red paper (officially citizens plus ... which is just as racist), and trudeau's the white paper.

h6r0228,2021-07-27T06:39:31.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access this is a slight misunderstanding that is pretty normal because canada deals with abortion differently than the united states. because anti-abortion activism is largely based out of america, a lot of people understand the topic in american terms. 

there is no *criminal law* respecting abortion in canada. 

that's because canada sees abortion as a medical procedure, leaving it to be governed by medical regulation or even medical college professional governance. 

that means a woman will not be prosecuted for procuring an abortion at any time in her pregnancy. 

that *does not* mean that a pregnancy will be available to her at any time, or that governments are obliged to offer them at any time. 

the time in which you can obtain an abortion will vary on available resources and medical concerns. for example, if you are 25 weeks pregnant in ontario with a healthy child and want an abortion, it will be difficult to obtain one. however, if you are 35 weeks pregnant (!) and there are serious medical issues discovered that pose threats to life, you may still get one if medically possible even though you're well under a month away from baby eta. 

the point is that in canada the decision will be evaluated from a medical rather than a criminal-legal perspective, the way it is in america. 

anti-abortion minded people are often uncomfortable with this state of affairs, preferring the bright-line, criminal-law style hard deadlines often present in american law. however, these bright lines can lead to real problems when dealing with something as inherently messy and difficult as human biology, and can lead to perverse outcomes. a medical basis for decision makes a lot of sense when dealing with something like abortion.",liberals

not according to me, according to reality.

i don't know if it *should* be an indictable offence. i think legislators were trying to make a political point as much as anything else. this should definitely be a civil issue, or possibly a summary offense, but an indictable offense that could result in prison time, 5 years no less? that seems extreme given the act.

on one hand, i don't think people who've clearly redeemed themselves should be held back and a $50 fee makes getting a pardon more accessible. i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

on the other hand, what we're doing is having the general public pay to deal with the side-effects of their previous criminality. committing crimes comes with immediate and societal consequences, and one of those consequences is a criminal record. if you want to go through the process to rid yourself of that consequence, i'm not sure i want to be the one paying for it.

like if someone is going to have to put in effort pay a $25,000 restitution associated with their criminality we as a society don't say \"na don't worry about that, the taxpayer's got you.\" we say \"well i guess you'd better get going on that.\" i don't necessarily see how this is different either.

secondly, i think politically-motivated extraditions are an obvious example of where we should exercise that discretion. foreign governments often try to suppress critics or advance their geopolitical agenda and if they are using extradition as a tool to do that, we should absolutely be saying no. in the case of wnazhou, it's pretty obvious the motivation was political (trump literally said he intended to use her as a bargaining chip). i don't think any other country would have approved this, and that's probably why the trump administration chose canada. we need to stop being an extension of us foreign policy - it's putting our citizens in danger, hurting trade and diminishing our reputation on the world stage.",liberals

majority/minority will be decided by quebec and to a lesser extent, bc. in quebec it looks like the liberals are doing a bit better than 2019, but the bloc remains a real threat outside of montreal. bc's all over the place, but overall, looking good for the liberals. it's gonna be an interesting campaign.

as to your example, i'd guess no? maybe? i don't know the actual legal definition of advertising, but there's a big difference between having something in an space where someone looking for it can find it, and paying to try to get it in front of as many eyes as possible. similar to how there are limits and rules about paying for political advertising but campaigns can put anything they want on their own campaign site.",conservatives

however, i think it's wrong to say that churches don't do any good. there's a lot of community outreach, food drive, after school services that are provided for a minimal cost if not free. however my concern is that when government support begins to erode for religious institutions, how far can it go? is next giving up tax-exempt status? i'm not saying that liberals are evil or anything, i'm just saying this is something religious communities need to be conscious of.

and as i've said in earlier comments, i do think you have a right and an obligation to vote in a way that voices your personal needs and concerns. and if churches vote heavily conservative (i won't be for the next while), this is why. 

&gt;also don’t know how to say this but conversion therapy (voluntary or not) is not legitimate and will just lead to repression and long term mental health issues

agree to disagree here. if someone wants to give up their rights to pursue happiness, that's their right. i could say the same for people who engage in extreme sports, alcohol/tobacco use, etc. these are things that with the right usage are ok, but are prone to being misused. we don't issue a blanket ban on those things. personal freedom is a big priority for me as someone with a libertarian bent.",liberals

but the current model being put forward resolves a lot of that. you can't even call it a tax with a rebate, its just a straight up savings account provided you use it to reduce emmisions. so the biggest polluters will have the most bucks to upgrade with.  that actually does work

and they go from a 155 dollar rate to a 20 dollar rate. lower than most provinces are already doing. 

and the people of canada have made it crystal clear that they want some sort of carbon pricing and climate change effort.

it's not \"denying them power\", its denying them more power than they deserve. but the politics of the conservative party are not necessarily the politics that drive feelings of western alienation. western canadians have similar feelings as the rest of canada on issues like wealth inequality and our healthcare system. is it possible to be a candidate in a party that has leftist views on those issues, while also working to address issues that cause dissatisfaction in the west? how do these dynamics change when ridings in in the prairies are no longer conservative safe seats and members of other parties can also compete for them?

i also think much of the dissatisfaction in western canada has similar roots to the dissatisfaction that pervades throughout the country, that our government simply isn't addressing key issues that cause economic anxieties. social safety nets of the kind that characterize europe's social democracies would help a lot with the sense of alienation from ottawa. at the same time, i believe that corruption----legislation by the status quo parties that favors an extremely small group of donors and lobbyists----has killed the potential for upwards mobility that would also make these people feel satisfied. naturally, i believe that the electoral system plays a key role in all this.",conservatives

(there's a lot of people that just assume they \"already had covid so probably have antibodies\" because they had a bad cold somewhen in the past year - 3 in the building, none of which were confirmed or got tested. they simply stopped caring.)

remember that most are not violent criminals. i see many mentioning the same person as if they are included in a pilot for \"sick and elderly inmates\" (as said in the article) or all are the same. remember also that no matter what they did, we are not a country who believes in capital punishment. 

even if you are heartless enough to want to leave them to die outbreaks do not stay in prisons. there are visitors. there are also guards, medical personnel, cooks, cleaners, etc who are all sharing the same air in areas that often have poor ventilation. they are part of the [provincial priority](https://twitter.com/justin_ling/status/1346627612593020928) but the first shot does not offer perfect protection. even if you care about them and not the inmates, vaccinating them alone is not enough. they did nothing wrong and are just trying to make a living.

i'm on the left obviously so grain of salt and all that but i think o'toole has relatively little to do with it and most of the problems the cpc are facing were baked into the cake from the get go. lets go through a few issues and see how.

1. \"end of the line on vaccines\" while o'toole gets to own the particulars in this case and for walking into what turned out to be a bit of a political trap it fits right in with the hyperbolic tone the cpc likes to take on everything. o'toole missing this trap would have been a turn for the better not a change of trajectory for the party.

2. climate change. everyone, o'toole included i suspect, knows that the cpc needs to get serious on climate change if they want to be taken seriously by the canadian electorate. while it's not exactly clear o'toole plans on this the fact that it got harder with the lpc announcement definitely throws a wrench into any effort to pivot towards the center while not pissing off their base. again though this is a constant trajectory for the party, not a problem o'toole invented.

3. the cpc and provincial fellow travelers have been playing footsie with the rebel and the like for some time. while i'm sure we'd all like that to change that's going to be challenging and once again is more a continuing of trajectory them a problem of o'toole in particular.

grs8v5f,2021-03-21T16:03:42.000-07:00,"conservative delegates reject adding 'climate change is real' to the policy book | cbc news i’d be surprised if the conservatives got elected again after doing this, unless they change their tone. if you google ‘percentage of canadians who care about climate change’ the numbers from various different surveys and sources, average that around 80% of canadians see climate change as an issue of priority. within that 80%, around half see it as a national emergency. the decisions people make through voting and in government , are ultimately going to determine the extent to which our planet is habitable in the years to come.

conservative consciousness has been taken over by many climate change biases including hyperbolic discounting, the bystander effect, and the sunk-cost fallacy. essentially this means that the concept of climate change is not really a big deal to conservatives because the threat is perceived to be too far away, someone else will deal with it, and that we are too invested in the status quo to take change seriously because change takes resources, time and effort. hyperbolic discounting is something a lot of people are guilty for when thinking of climate change, including myself as i tend to live the status quo life forgetting to do more while knowing that so much of our security and stability is under an accelerating threat in the years to come. i am also guilty of the bystander effect because i’m not causing change. these cognitive flaws are built in us and we need to recognize them, and recognize if the people we are voting for carry them. 

even if o’toole cares about climate change, he is in the wrong party because the majority base of the party aren’t even willing to recognize it, or those who do are downplaying it’s significance. a party who thinks that the livelihoods of canadians aren’t significant enough to protect them from harm probably won’t do exceptionally well. 

we declared a war on nature by killing 60% of its biodiversity. it’s only getting worse from climate change. a war on nature (the heart of humanity) would be a war more harmful than any human war and this war has only just begun. it’s time to try and sign the peace treaty with nature because the balance of power lies with nature and not humanity. people say we are earths intelligence but we are really not that smart if we allow politicians to continue the status-quo stabbing of ourselves in the heart of humanity. there were many times in the past where people realized that their status-quo lives were immoral. this might be another time to recognize.

1. the vast majority of straight people who cheat have outside sexual partners who are not msm, and therefore face a much lower average risk of their partner being hiv positive

2. even when they do have sex with an hiv positive partner, they are less likely to engage in the practices which are riskiest for hiv transmission (i.e. receptive anal sex)

3. the transmission risk within heterosexual couples is lower than msm couples even if one of them *is* cheating with a msm and acquires hiv as a result, for the same reason as point 2

on literally each level of comparison the risk is orders of magnitude higher for msm couples than for heterosexual couples.

&gt;ultimately because the cost are not particularly important, it isn’t the reason the restrictions exist nor is it the reason they are maintained.

that's not true at all, you're just not thinking about it that way. risk can be reduced to a nearly arbitrary degree with more money. with unlimited money we could repeatedly test every sample of blood to the point that we should expect zero cases of hiv from false negatives. the whole reason these deferrals exist is there are implicit constraints on the resources we can assign to the blood supply. excluding msm is a huge win for low cost risk reduction - you exclude 3-5% of the population but over 50% of hiv positive people.",liberals

h12n3og,2021-06-08T06:42:46.000-07:00,"liberals, bloc vote to end bill c-10 study amid social media free speech concerns &gt;if that is the case, codify it in law.

the principle *is* codified in law. section 5(2)(h). it’s right there in the bill. unless what you want is the *broadcasting act* to say, “u/pierrepoutine2’s online-store web-page demoing a product is hereby excluded,” along with a billion other individual examples, which is impossible and not how just about any laws work anywhere.

&gt;which is exactly why i think removing the user-generated content protection was silly, which you summarily dismiss. if it will never be used against user-generated content, why remove the protection in the first place? unless you want to retain the ability to regulate user content at some point in time.

i did not summarily dismiss, i explained. “users” include both individuals and massive corporations. the content of massive corporations should be captured; the individuals should not. the direction is codified in the law at section 5(2)(h). the line between the two will be drawn by the crtc.

&gt;once again codify it. it was actually codified with an exemption that was removed. do not leave it up to interpretation.

why? codifying a specific threshold that may make sense today will ensure it’s out of date by tomorrow. it’s usually the anti-regulation crowd who are insisting that the internet moves fast and things change quickly. it is precisely this reason that flexibility in the legislation is required.

again, the principle is codified. the implementation will change over time. the track record of the crtc demonstrates that they’re far more likely to under-regulate than over-regulate.

&gt;that said even if some of those \"users\" are corporations, they are not distributing full features on youtube (in the case of movie or tv shows-they are promotional trailers - ie commercials) and in the case of music, are not monetizing the videos.

that’s news to youtube, who [claimed to have paid the music industry over $3 billion in 2019](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/youtube-says-it-paid-the-music-industry-over-3bn-last-year-around-20-of-its-annual-ad-revenue-is-that-a-good-deal-for-artists/). you’re simply wrong here.

&gt;i think the bigger issue is that user-generated \"amateur\" content is competing with production video and eating its lunch among younger demographics, and is seen as a threat from the smaller canadian production companies. adding regulatory hurdles to user-generated content to protect the production video industry doesn't do anyone any favours nor is there anything stopping these \"professional\" creators from going the amateur route and making youtube videos if that is where the money is. rather than adapt to the market, they want to be protected. why not just make youtube videos if that is what the market wants... as professionals they would already have advantages over amateurs.

all of that is unsourced, unsubstantiated and just as wrong as your previous comment.

&gt;both. one of spotify's main advantages over its rival streamers is its recommendation algorithm..

this entire paragraph is a switch from what we were talking about. you went from, “this won’t help artists,” to, “this will make the service worse for me as a consumer.” which is your point? they are not the same points, and involve different arguments.

as for switching from spotify to apple music, despite both recommendation algorithms being subject to the same regulation, you don’t explain how or why that would be the case. but if your ultimate point is that we need to protect the profits of spotify, then ok, but i fail to see what they would be a canadian public policy priority.

&gt;i said both because a user has to listen to at least 30 seconds of song to count as a play. if someone skips it after a few seconds, it doesn't count as a play and the artist makes no money. simply recommending it to people, especially if it is out of context in certain genre playlists, is anti-consumer and will turn me off the artist that gets recommended through no fault of their own. it will not make them extra money.

there is a whole slew of unsubstantiated assumptions in that paragraph but, even if it’s true, then the crtc will hear that loud and clear from artists and record labels and it won’t happen, because literally nobody will want it to happen. the fact that groups representing canadian artists support this legislation, however, and they can be presumed to understand their business better than you suggests that maybe there are reasons to think they’re wrong.

&gt;what if i share my own playlist, will spotify be forced to add canadian content to it, even if i didn't have it in my playlist? that is getting into slipper charter territory there. user-generated playlists are also big on these services... i don't want the government forcing drake into mine...

there is no reason to believe that will happen. you are casting about at shadows.

&gt;if hbomax has to put a portion of their revenue into a fund for canadian producers, but hbomax doesn't carry non-hbomax content, how can it be anything but funding their competition?

there is absolutely no requirement in c-10 for hbomax, or any other streamer, to put revenue into a fund. none. cite the bill if you feel otherwise. streamers that operate in canada—which hbomax does not, by the way—will almost certainly be required to spend a certain amount of money on canadian programming that they provide on their own service, for the benefit of their own subscribers.

&gt;hbo is not canadian so could never own the shows, they could only ever license them, and its not something they do. they aren't netflix that rebrands worldwide content as netflix originals all the time (mostly foreign stuff). the whole point of them going direct is to get rid of the middle-men (not just the distribution middle-men). disney+ is the same thing. thats why there is huge consolidation in the industry as a whole (outside the canadian market context). its why disney bought fox, why at&amp;t bought warner and hbo, and then merged with discovery. independent producers are going to go the way of the dodo... individual creators might pitch shows but they will be owned and produced by these studios...not just financed by them for distribution rights.

there is so much wrong with this paragraph, i’m not sure where to start. you don’t speak for hbo, so cannot claim what they will or won’t do. netflix doesn’t “rebrand worldwide content,” they commission it just like other broadcasters. none of this has anything do to with “going direct” or not. there actually has been huge consolidation in the canadian market, not just outside it, but i don’t see what relevance that has. the definition of canadian content may well change to allow web giants to own the canadian content they fund, even though that will have certain negative repercussions on the sector. independent producers may well go the way of the dodo, but that has nothing to do with canadian creators making canadian content (as redefined) or not.

&gt;my point about bell and letterkenny is that there is very little canadian content produced (in english canada), especially of the variety that counts as cancon, other than the cbc. it was sarcastic. ctv, global, or crave could survive without licensing us or other foreign content.

i don’t know what your definition of “very little” is in this context, but by any common sense one i can think of, that’s simply not true. in the english market, private broadcasters spent 65% more on canadian-certified television than public broadcasters did. you are again factually wrong.

but even if you were right, how does that support your claim that ctv, global, or crave could survive without u.s./foreign content? what, exactly, would they show, if they both commission “very little canadian content” and have no non-canadian content?

&gt;how many original (and i mean truly original - not canadian idol or amazing race canada, real housewives of toronto, etc) do our broadcasters (other than the cbc) still make, other than the news?

i don’t know how or why “truly original” became a criteria for this discussion. american idol itself was a format buy from pop idol in the u.k. do people claim it’s somehow “not really a u.s. network show” as a result, or something? and what’s the time frame? this year? the past 5 years? the past 10 years?

you’re certainly right that private english-canadian broadcasters don’t make nearly as much as they could or should. that’s precisely one of the arguments in favour of c-10, so i don’t know why you’re making it, when you supposedly oppose the bill.

that said, from the past decade or so, there’s cardinal, transplant, orphan black, continuum, 19-2, degrassi, rookie blue, flashpoint, trailer park boys, private eyes, corner gas, and a ton of kids’ shows and documentaries. what was/is the point of this?

&gt;if it is good it will stand on its own merit.

“merit” doesn’t produce shows. money does. and money comes from economics, profit motives, and market size, among other things. “the market always does the best things,” is an article of faith of neoliberals, libertarians, and the like. the real world is more complicated than that.",liberals

however, i think it's also fair to say that the economic conditions that held in early 2014 when the current formula was written do not hold now.

the rest of the country had been suffering from the 2008 recession and hadn't quite picked themselves back up yet, whereas alberta was at the peak of a boom. a formula that took more out of alberta at that time made sense - and if the harper government had written one more favourable to alberta at that time they would have been (rightly) accused of favouring their political heartland at the expense of a country that needed help. 

the program came up for regularly scheduled review in 2019, where the liberals declined to make any changes. it's thus incumbent upon them to explain why, in their view, the formula as set in 2014 *continues to be appropriate* despite the significant changes in relatively regional prosperity. saying kenney wrote the formula isn't a sufficient answer, because kenney didn't make the choice to not change it as the economy changed - *trudeau* made that choice

the cpc on the other hand is in a situation where they are so antithetical to everyone else that if they can't win, then when they have 140 seats or 5 seats they're in the same position of being able to do absolutely nothing. in that sense, i'd say the cpc is in facing existential problems than the ndp - if they can't solve them, they may as well not exist",conservatives

and thanks. gonna be straight up here first and foremost. i am not a malthusian. i think he was a wise fool. not stupid. not wrong per se. but not right either. we don't need to decrease the amount of hairless apes... yet. it's more like we need a rebalance of sorts, for a lot of things, but right now is about population and age. now, we can't be getting heartless here, as this is a very ... nuanced area to talked about. there are just too many elderly now in a lot of places, and the aging workforce is becoming a bit more of a hinderance to the younger generations than a boon. it would be great if a lot of them could be retired somehow. perhaps transitioned into some sort of profession where they teach their old trade instead of practicing it anymore, so as to make way for new people. it doesn't always have to be about death. (though i admit i had to try hard to avoid that option. war and disease have been very helpful in this regards in the past, like it or not.) {sorry bleed hearts if that's too much for you to handle, but nature is metal, and we have to come to terms with that.}

okay, so yeah you are right that it doesn't matter where the new population comes from. note though that i kept it between just two concepts of immigrants and kids, like you did. if we are getting into the meat and bones of things here, then yes those kids could be immigrants; but i think we both understand fully that most immigrants are not kids, except for those kids that come with their *immigrant parents*. typically that is. of course there are bound to be some exceptions, i am sure of it. but the rule of thumb is most immigrant kids are coming with their parents. setting aside human trafficking of course, which is a whole other can of worms.

so, when we refer to more kids in this situation, it typically is in reference to the people already living here having more kids. not bringing in more kids from elsewhere. not that it can't be done. i am sure there are orphans everywhere that would prefer it anywhere else than where they are, in a lot of cases. but that doesn't actually solve the lack of a younger population continuing to exist to help support the older. it just shifts where that young population is, and i think we have to come to terms with being somewhat a global society now in that regards. what do i mean by that?

essentially, i think we need to stop looking at just the countries populations on their own. covid is thoroughly proving this i think, with how so many supply chains faltered and failed in a lot of different ways. if for instance we take young people from countries that need them to support their own aging populous, then when that aging populous ages out of work, or dies, or gets sick; that country is in for a tough time if it can't replace that worker fast enough. sure, just one worker probably won't cause this to happen, in a properly managed situation. but it can, in a situation where the spare talent just doesn't exist.

so. to be very succinct about it here. i think we need a population boom; but not world wide yet. just in the places clearly needing a boost to help keep that pyramid scheme going. because you are right. it is one. absolutely. but it's one that we all like it or not, seem to let continue in society. it's not a bad pyramid. it's just... not easy to maintain when the rulers are fools. if they were wise, they would making attempts to get older people to retire earlier. but that is awash with problems as well.

honestly... despite everything said before this...

it's probably best off for all of us younger folk to just go off and start our own towns along the best highways. i'm actively considering it. the north is opening up, like it or not, and there is growing evidence we are going to see the earths \"productive zone\" shift north into russia, canada, and northern europe. it's currently going straight through america, etc. this has to do with global climates, etc. yukon gov't is definitely getting ready for this, whether they are actively aware or not. if you check out their website and look into the supports they are giving for farmland and industry, you'll see they are well poised for the future. (or i think they are, so far.) that alaska highway is also helping a lot. (350k+ travellers from usa alone in 2019 last i checked, and they had another 150k from immigration and canadians.) population? roughly 42k.

so. we do have options, but this one is going to require us to get along and find ways to make it work for now and the future. that is, in comparison to getting the gov't to wise up. i would hope that my peers have figured out by now through both harper and trudeau that this is not something to be expecting, and to only be happy when they do things right now and then.

his caucus may or may not be accountable depending on the case due to caucus unity. in this case i suspect the elected mps are required to be unified and thus they are accountable. 

it does follow however what blanchett says and does in his capacity as party leader reflects on the legal entity and political party the bloc québécois because he has been elected to represent it.

subsequent to blanchett’s actions as leader, the voting members, donors, and caucus may hold him accountable. 

however in this case i would not bet blanchett will face internal revolt but i would applaud it if they did.

it’s important to not tangle up to direction of control and accountability and get it backwards.",liberals

all these strong words signal to me is how the government is using the airlines to score political points. if the 14-day quarantine has been  \"extraordinarily effective.\" then a flight ban is over kill. if the 14-day quarantine has been \"extraordinarily effective.\", then a 3-day-prior negative test is over kill. this entirely fits with the complete radio silence different industry groups have been getting from this government.

now if by chance the tories and bloc joined the call in asking gg to deny trudeau an election (something he as a single person does not have a right to demand) then the gg is left to make a very real decision of their own as whether or not to disolve parliament and if they choose not to it'd be upholding democracy given trudeau represents a minority of the population.
