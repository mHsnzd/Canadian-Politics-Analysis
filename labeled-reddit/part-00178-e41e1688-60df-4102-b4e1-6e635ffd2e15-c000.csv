if true, this would indicate a possible serious horserace. erin has two jobs - sell a nice, simple, powerful vision of the future and convince people he's a good guy personally. that is going to be very tough to do both during the 4 or 5 weeks trudeau is going to give him - there's little chance of trudeau going for a traditional 6 week election or more. and one of those weeks is likely to be in august when people won't be paying much attention, so it's really 4 weeks. and i doubt he'll get more than 2 debates, one in english and one in french, maybe a second english debate but unlikely.

the best example, or at least the most overt, is when the [commons called tom mulcair to come and testify before a house committee on ndp satellite offices](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/motion-ordering-mulcair-to-committee-went-too-far-speaker-1.2673682).  

scheer allowed the conservatives to use a procedure unintended for calling someone to committee to force mulcair's attendance. a month later, and after mulcair had done so, scheer found the motion out of order and chided the ndp for not raising a point of order sooner. 

**however**, pursuant to [standing order 13](https://www.ourcommons.ca/about/standingorders/chap1-e.htm#so2) the speaker has a responsibility to inform the house if a motion is contrary to the rules and privileges of parliament. 

considering scheer stated that \"if\" someone had objected on a point of order at the time, he would have agreed and found the motion out of order, that establishes that in scheer's opinion he knew the motion was contrary to the rules and as such had a responsibility to inform the house as such. 

effectively, scheer admitted he knew it was wrong but wrote it off because the speaker is supposed to stay silent. except in this one specific case, where the standing orders allow the speaker to inform the house. 

which leaves two options: either scheer was uninformed/unfamiliar with the rules of the house (which is bad for a speaker) or he made a partisan decision and let it go through. pick one.

(and yes, it's bad that the ndp at the time didn't have anyone else familiar enough to raise a point of order at the moment...but if someone was versed in the rules, they might have thought that the speaker would advise the house as per 13...not much of a defence, perhaps, but at least a tad more leeway.)",conservatives

no, it‚Äôs not in the statute regarding this crime. 

essential elements of the offence

the image is an intimate image

the working group recognizes that it would be inappropriate to criminalize the distribution of photos that are simply embarrassing or unflattering. the term \"intimate images\" is intended to refer to images that relate to the core of a person's privacy interest. such images are generally understood to depict explicit sexual activity or nudity or partial nudity that is captured on film or video consensually.

- https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/cndii-cdncii/p6.html

it‚Äôs a crime. it‚Äôs premised on the distribution of intimate images, ie, sexual images. you narrowly define the broad colloquial term ‚Äúsex crime‚Äù to mean physical assaults only. 

distributing child pornography? that‚Äôs a sex crime to me.

h6rol45,2021-07-27T09:46:30.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‚Äòmillions of dollars‚Äô from n.b. over abortion access i encourage you to look into our canadian organizations and statistics on this matter. canadian institute on health information/journal of obstetrics and gynecology/statistics canada are all better sources than certain pro-life organizations. you seem to agree that legally allowing all abortions in our country is a good thing due to being medically necessary at times. great. you do also appear to believe that we in canada perform abortions for any reason at any gestational age, no questions asked about the morality of that and that's just not accurate.

any fetus below 24 weeks gestation  is not considered viable outside the womb (and even those close to this age are guranteed lifetime issues varying from mild autoimmune disorders to severe disabilities, not to mention months of intensive medical care). many people like to argue about whether abortions past 24 weeks should be legal/moral but it might comfort you to know it is a tiny percentile of therapeutic abortions that are performed past 24 weeks. much less than 1% of all abortions (100% of these medically necessary? - research this to find out).


it might also comfort you to know that there are large barriers in place for getting therapeutic abortions even past the first trimester (12 weeks) and massive barriers past 24 weeks in most provincial healthcare systems. these barriers are formed from related laws and healthcare policies to more complicated things like economic pressure and facility access. hope this has been helpful.",liberals

i think this is probably the most important part about this policy paper: if the courts are already signaling they're going to move in this direction and use website blocking as a means to remedy certain copyright violation situations, then the cat is sort of out of the bag. it doesn't really matter what the government does, or does not here, because the courts appear to be okay with using website blocking in certain cases. hell, as another user in this thread has pointed out, there was a ruling handed down *today* that had a higher court agreeing with a lower court.

have a walk down granville island. notice how there's no raised sidewalks. huh. isn't that weird. why is that? it's because granville island is federal land and they don't have to conform to either bc/vancouver building code, transportation code, rules etc.

you may also notice that the port of vancouver and department of defence areas also build whatever the fuck they want without any sort of municipal signs. federal lands that aren't beholden to the city.

you may also have noticed that pav co put up giant fuck off electric advertising boards all around the provincially owned stadium even though city of vancouver has rules against this. again, it's because the province doesn't need to obey municipal laws on its lands.

if the feds actually wanted to create affordable housing, they could buy land and build housing on it and city of vancouver would be no barrier. look to social housing apartments in strathcona built by the cmhc in the 60s as an example of this. the feds don't do this because they don't care to actually solve the problem. instead they just say \"yeah the city should do something\" and shrug.

\"in fact, the plan doesn‚Äôt give a specific percentage target for canada, but it does commit to a 450-megatonne reduction by 2030. that works out to a 37 per cent reduction of emissions below 2005 levels.\"

so the liberals exceeded their promises in 2019, plus if you factor in their proposed policies like the clean fuel standard and the tree planting initiative their climate policies are very similar in impact to the ndp. 

the liberals are definitely inconsistent when it comes to delivering on their proposed policies but climate is not one of them. they bought the pipeline because of political concessions to a province and in keeping with their position as peacemakers in a federation. and the net projected emissions reductions are still drastically in their favour.

they differ from the generation before who tended to downsize in retirement and vacate the city cores. the shift in pattern is a big part of the housing shortages.

&gt;interesting, they are one of the smaller demographics in canada, but somehow they hold all the political will?

the older people tend to be more engaged in voting, especially at a municipal level. younger people often skip municipal elections. 

&gt;meaning they have all the single detached houses within city cores, that young people want to own. not sure why one demographics wants are better than another.

the cities have grown to a point where the municipalities should not allow single detached in the core. there is finite real estate and single detached is a terrible use of it in city cores. it's not that one demographic deserves it more, it's that one demographic is using all their political power to prevent the cores from changing and adapting.

&gt;there ftfy. who in their right mind wants to devalue their largest single investment? hint, it's everyone who has made the investment, not just boomers.blaming everything on boomers is not only not true, it's just silly. everyone over 18 gets a vote, and boomers are no longer the power house demographic they used to be.

it chokes out the cities, it's valuing a specific demographics wealth over the general health of cities which in the long run will hurt their wealth anyways. it's a short sighted for cities to allow those stake holder to control their future, and no it's not silly it's specifically the bulk of the housing problems. the single detached and the owners of them are stalling and averting any change which means the cities cannot build enough homes. 

most cities that transition from medium city to a major city take those decisions of the hands of 'neighbors'. cities like tokyo don't consult neighbors when building and it allows the city to build to demand.

&gt;oh, and btw, most of the people who have been moving into my community and region are boomers from toronto. in just the last 3 years the median age in my neighborhood has moved from 48 to 52, moving me from being slightly older than the median age, to slightly younger. 57% don't have jobs. literally half of my block is retired people from toronto. they came here for the cheap housing.

tangential. the single detached in the middle of toronto is a big reason why no one can afford a home. it really should be 6 apartments units in the same footprint. the demand of those 6 apartment units are concentrated on that one single detached driving the price up.

the cities and other levels need to shift zoning out of the control of home owners. eliminate consultation and just let the market eventually buy out the single detached in the core and build up. the owners aren't going to get shafted ad they will make a handsome amount in the sale but they should not be allowed to stall all change.",liberals

gxgtag4,2021-05-08T14:52:55.000-07:00,"wage subsidies were meant to preserve jobs. in many cases, the $110.6-billion response padded bottom lines [analysis of cews](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/january-2021/there-are-better-ways-of-helping-the-economy-than-cews/) from michael smart and ben eisen, january 2021.

&gt; when the pandemic hit, the trudeau government was right to act quickly to introduce sweeping economic measures to help families and businesses get through the crisis. however, as time goes by, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of various programs to determine how much they are actually helping, or whether the money being spent on them might be better used elsewhere. as the largest component of the government‚Äôs pandemic response package, cews should be subject to close scrutiny.
&gt;
&gt; the idea behind cews could make sense. by lowering the cost of retaining workers for struggling businesses, the program should help to reduce unemployment and keep incomes flowing. but at what cost? the problem is that cews payments are paid for all workers at affected businesses, not just those facing the prospect of lost earnings. most of the jobs funded by cews would still exist in the absence of the subsidy. for this reason, cews is an expensive way of protecting vulnerable workers.
&gt;
&gt; perhaps recognizing the problems, ottawa implemented reforms in september to reduce the subsidy rates and phase out the program over time.

comparison to other countries:

&gt; other countries have recognized the problems with wage subsidies and have made reforms. the united states offered similar support in the spring of 2020 through the paycheck protection program, albeit only to smaller businesses. researchers found it had virtually no impact on employment and it has since been wound down.
&gt;
&gt; ireland and australia also operated similar wage subsidies in the early months of the pandemic. both countries reduced subsidies and tightened eligibility in september. the result is more cost-effective programs, better targeted to the hardest-hit businesses.
&gt;
&gt; most european countries do not offer general wage subsidies to businesses. instead, they offer ‚Äújob retention‚Äù schemes that encourage employers to put workers on shorter hours instead of laying them off. that targets assistance to the jobs that are most at risk, exactly as canada should be doing.",liberals

&gt;  
&gt;our analysis of the financial filings of canada‚Äôs 102 biggest corporations shows these companies have avoided paying $62.9 billion in income taxes over the past six years.

evasion/avoidance, different things sure, but consequences are the same. 

it doesn't have to be taxes, but there is an issue that exists that taxes can solve: cost of living has massively outstripped wage growth. taxes can offset the problem via public funding of necessary and widely used programs. or we provide a large boost to incomes. or we mitigate cost of living growth. or we do a mixture of all 3. either way, the problem needs to be solved.",liberals
