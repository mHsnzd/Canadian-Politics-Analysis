other ways can be every chinese or russian affiliated news source is marked with like the most intense disclaimers. which is fine, but why not say the same for news sources from all countries? let people decide if what they are seeing is complete nonsense instead of being primed to think that before the video is watched.

other examples is the site truthdig, which was shut down, believe to be due to calling out nonsense of russiagate, which who knows what the actual theory was at this pint, but nothing really came out of it and the media hasn't gone back and said whoops that was all fake
https://scheerpost.com/2020/03/27/chris-hedges-interview-amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-wealthy-publisher-shuts-down-progressive-media-outlet/

other ones may be how certain news is demonetized when it comes from \"non-authoritative\" sources. so when people talk about the capitol riots, they get flagged as supporting conspiracy theories. or when people talk about the impacts of imperialism in the world they are suppressed and demonetized. why? large news channels ignore these topics.
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/01/censorship-big-tech-facebook-twitter

the most common types could be just demonetization for talking about politics, favouring large sources over independent ones in algorithms, and banning people without needing to provide a clear reason. 

tech companies have far too much control over censoring people, so maybe this approach would put some guardrails on that, but those guardrails can just change when someone else is elected, or can be still manipulated to deprioritize certain content.",conservatives

sorry, but new brunswick is somewhat of a rarity in canada, where there are enough bilingual people that you aren't dramatically narrowing your talent pool whenever you make bilingual fluency a requirement.

west of the ottawa, bilingualism is largely a luxury of the elite or the relatively sparse francophone populations that progressively thin out beyond eastern ontario. young people free to spend their summers at explore programs instead of working and who have other opportunities to learn by speaking mostly come from wealthy families. they are also far more likely to non-immigrants, as young immigrants are already learning a second or third language in english.

the problem is represented well in trudeau's appointments to the supreme court of canada, all of whom have been white despite their stated preference for a more diverse crowd. especially with the last western appointment, a fair few short-listers were disqualified because of lack of fluency in french, so instead of a first nations jurist, they went with the white person who'd had the opportunity to learn it.

this is only the most high profile instance of the phenomena - but across the civil service, we're able to recruit only from a relatively small percentage of our own population. this percentage is overwhelmingly white and from quebec, eastern and norther ontario and the east coast. 

this percentage is neither more nor less talented, capable or dutiful than anyone else. 

but drawing *only* from that population necessarily means excluding most of the potential talent pool. every population pool can only provide so much talent. the more you restrict your pool, the more you must compromise on qualification.

this is the basis of social-economic liberalism - that the more we expand the pool of those qualified professionals (e.g., by allowing equal economic access to women, people of colour etc.) the better qualified professionals we will recruit. it's simply statistics. 

as it stands, the bilingualism requirements of course make a great deal of sense. we are a bilingual country. people should be able to work and be served in french in service of their country. 

it is wrong to pretend, however, that this does not come with a steep cost in terms of available talent and the overall diversity of the civil service. 

by quebec and canada going their separate ways, we could probably dispense with this limitation nationally. protections for french could be maintained, new brunswick's official bilingualism enforced, french services offered, and translation services provided at high levels (e.g., for supreme court justices). 

the more diverse and broader talent pool, in my opinion, would be a good thing. no doubt, its a compromise either way.

don't get me wrong. if we were in some horrible version of history where i were an mp, i would vote in favour of this proposal (barring some poison pill i don't know about). bilingualism is necessary while quebec is part of canada, and will always be necessary in new brunswick. but this is an important part of why i don't think quebec should be part of canada.",liberals

&gt; true, just as quebec will have to respect canadian law that treat quebec as a province. 

and canada will have to respect canadian law that treats quebec as a  clearly defined political entity.

&gt; remember, this territory belonged to canada before canada gave it to quebec to administer in 1898 and 1912.

and canada gave it away, tough luck. 

&gt; as such, the cree, naskapi, and inuit will get final say on the matter as all these acts were carried under colonialist coercion, as were all treaties signed with quebec.

\"colonial coercion\" has no constitutional weight and does not give \"final say\". much less for treaties. treaties cannot be renegotiated due to some vague notion of \"colonial coercion\". the james bay actually extinguishes native claims, title, and rights in the area, so northern treaties signed with quebec specifically are the only thing that carry constitutional weight in this area. land definitions are very clearly established.

&gt;they have by no means gven up on claims to the entire territory, 

considering that the james bay northern quebec agreement actually extignuishes claims, that statement does not hold a lot of water.

&gt;and you'll see them get a territory or province of their own such as nunuvut,

so i suppose i'd wonder whether mr. braid believes the house of lords is elected or if he believes the uk isn't a democracy.

where has quebec or any aboringal nation ever that they have extringuished their claims in the north? show it to me in writing.

[http://www.nationnewsarchives.ca/article/setting-the-record-straight-on-the-jbnqa/](http://www.nationnewsarchives.ca/article/setting-the-record-straight-on-the-jbnqa/)

&gt;40 years after the signing of the agreement in principle leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement (jbnqa), chiefs of the innu, attikamekw nations and certain anishinaabe communities announced the formation of a coalition to defend the aboriginal title and rights they claim were extinguished in the territory covered by the jbnqa. the goal of their opposition, they state, is not to attack the jbnqa but rather to have the “extinguishment” clause declared illegal and inapplicable to them ... the crees have taken the position that the clause did not include natural resources but only a sharing of the lands. this position was asserted in the great whale river and forestry proceedings and is implicitly recognized in la paix des braves.\"

you see, when landry caved to cree political pressure witht he paix des braves, he acknowledged implicitly that the extinguishment clause was illegal. that's why the quebec government has never taken the racist and colonialist step of applying the extinguishment clause. they know it would not survive a court challenge and that james bay agreement was the last of a series of colonialist attacks on aboriginal sovereigny in quebec.

so i'm not saying it is impossible to have a two-tier system that is run well, but it's not fair to say that's why those systems work. canada's can work well as it is, but there are lots of issues to address that are more complex and won't be solved by simply allowing people to cut in the triage line because they can afford to, which frankly is, imo, un-canadian.

i've mentioned in a thread a couple of days ago, it's not really clear to me if the lpc are operating under a deliberate strategy in which they release their platform deeper into the election (the norm, by and large) and whether or not having one already ready and in hand is a mistake. it *feels* like a mistake, but maybe releasing the platforms early won't have as much of an impact as it might seem, if the election isn't near people's top of mind.",liberals

if the rich were in the public schools, they'd care more about the quality of education there. we might get some privileged people who learn empathy for others who aren't as fortunate as they are because they grew up with them.

i also can't comment on whether that stat includes people living with their parents as home owners.  not sure where you got that from, but not something i'm willing to argue about.  

look i get it.  the ridiculous rise in home prices impacts way more than just first time home buyers, and potential home buyers.  it can really stop the traditional mobility that people have moving from smaller to larger homes, different cities or provinces.  overall it's not a good thing.  i just tend not to blame things on boomers (not saying you have) which is popular on reddit.  i'm far more likely to blame it on customer demand.  everyone seems to want single detached houses, and frankly it's the least efficient form of housing that costs the most.  i get it, i live in a single detached home, but i also live in a small community a couple of hours from toronto.  which has it's own inconveniences, and extra costs.  i\"m not sure exactly how we get out of this, but i do know there are a pile of developers who are making a fortune building mcmansions for people in my region, and most are well below the million dollar mark.",liberals

a bigger factor is the allocation of resources (funding), doctors per capita, etc., and other more complex issues in the canadian healthcare system. if having two-tier systems was the determining factor, you'd see a lot of developing countries catching up to canada, which is not the case. colombia and cuba have some of the best healthcare systems in latin america and neither take after the private/two-tier model, but again, they have more focused and efficient resources than the fractured, multi-tiered systems in other latin american countries, relatively speaking.",liberals

one thing is definitely true though. part of the reason it has been so difficult to get straight answers is that the government painted a pretty rosy picture of what q1 would look like compared to what has actually happened. people are struggling mentally and don't need to be jerked around under any circumstances for political points. this government promised to be transparent, clear, and plain with canadians and in a time when that has been desperately needed they have been vague, dodged questions, and generally made it difficult to know what is what. huge failure on their part and i do think other parties would have done better on that front.",liberals

gum70r2,2021-04-15T01:46:19.000-07:00,"conservatives' climate plan would replace liberal carbon tax with lower one of their own i thought this was a beaverton headline at first.

well, i guess credit where credit is due. we finally have a conservative leader willing to stand behind some form of carbon tax, for the first time since .... early harper?

i have so many questions about this though, will have to withhold judgement until the plan is released:

1) what happens to provincial carbon taxes? (in bc would we still be exempted?)

2) lowering the carbon price from $170 back to $50/tonne will weaken it. does it go beyond the current climate plan in any other way, to make up for that? (if it doesn't, wouldn't it fail to be paris agreement-compliant?)

3) is this \"green debit account\" going to be the same amount of rebate that is offered under the current plan? greater? less? (would have distributional impacts on whether it primarily helps wealthier or poorer people)

4) what purchases would qualify for you to withdraw funds from this account? or is it only \"recommended\" that you spend it on green things, but you don't have to? (like, is it an rrsp-style account or tfsa-style account)

5) will o'toole have the conservative premiers like kenney and ford on board with this?

edit: [o'toole's speech](https://twitter.com/cpc_hq/status/1382709536449048579) is here, it sounds like the carbon tax replacement will be similar to a reward points card. you still get an extra fee at the gas pump, but instead of being collected by the government, it's collected by a private partner on you (the customer's) behalf and you can redeem purchases of bikes, transit passes, electric cars, and so on.",conservatives

i understood this to mean \"those renters are finally coming around the downsides of their choices\", which probably wasn't how you meant it, so i apologise if i dismissed your argument out of hand on a misunderstanding.

i also believe that this may need to go hand-in-hand with a shift in our view of \"car ownership\", just as with home ownership - car-sharing services like communauto are nascent but picking up steam, and if many occasional car users were able to have access to a car that they did not privately own for a reasonable fee (less over an average year than registration + insurance + maintenance, \"fuel\" costs being equal), that would drastically reduce the number of cars that needed parking spots, leave more room for daily drivers, and perhaps reduce *some* of the infrastructure overhead needed to permit a full-ev model.",liberals

the second purpose can justify stricter measures for those recently arrived from countries with more cases than we have, but not dramatically stricter border controls. we already require a negative pcr test and a 14 day quarantine. this is massive overkill.

liberals do get into fights about modes of governance and visions for the country. the centralized/decentralized split (largely about quebec), language and indigenous rights, how to appoint judges, right to die legislation. these are things that have really cause major splits in the party in the past decade. some do map to a standard \"right\"/\"left\" axis, but many don't, or don't very well. 

there certainly are intra-party debates that do: the introduction (and affordability) of basic income, universal child care, pharmacare, dental, etc...

but the snc affair that nearly killed this government was not about a right/left split. it was about a power struggle over the autonomy of the justice minister and their accountability to cabinet and the pm. there's lots of bad judgement there too (on all sides, imo), but that was fundamentally a power struggle in cabinet.",liberals

when you consider that and include the international insanity that is qanon and all the misinformation therein, and yes i think there absolutely was a time when millions were donning maga caps whole not being extremists or even tacitly being ok with it.

when the canadian conservative parties stop using gop apparatus and rhetoric, the comparisons will stop. in the meantime the same white supremacist organization that helped coordinate the storming of the capitol in the us this week, is very much a canadian born one (even if the leader has been a new york resident for 25 years, proud boys are quite born and bred in canada), and cpc members are very much aligned with the proud boys and maga crowd.
