1.he said that there are 3 options, first option the cpc could lose ground, second the lpc could lose ground, thi7rd the ndp could lose ground he specified that 2 options between these 3 is correct.

lets see what happens if the cpc decreases, the most probable result would help the lpc and a bit the ndp it is not the first option, 2 have to diminish.

lets see now with option 2, if the lpc diminishes both the ndp gains and the cpc gains, it is not option 2.

now option 3, ndp diminishes, if they lose ground cpc decreases but lpc increases, the most probable option is option 3.

second. i know, i know we are only at the second point but im trying to get at the bottom of these riddles so lets keep going. he said that those who didnt pay attention would be confusef but those who noticed will understand. 

what have been going on for a few days? the decrease of the conservatives and something else more subtle, the stalling and the decrease of ndp.

third. the third and last point who have been on the news for controversies? the lpc and the cpc, he stated that the answer to his riddles is subtle, the lpc and the cpc havent been subtle in the news these days, so it is obvious to me that he is talking about the point 3 and 1 of his riddle. i think the ndp will make a few gains in quebec and i think they will lose ground elsewhere. about the bloc i think they will also lose ground but i will explain that in more details in another post, thank you for your patience.",conservatives

i think conservatism is best described as a disposition rather than ideology and this is especially true for me i think. i think good things are hard to make and can be easily destroyed even with good intentions. i very much agree with the quote \"tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems. throw away the solution and you get the problem back. sometimes the problem has mutated or disappeared. often it is still there as strong as it ever was.\" for these reasons, i am reticent to push for radical changes that undermine traditions.",conservatives

a  bnn bloomberg review of certain cerb-related posts on the app highlights a range of comical and braggy videos. in one tiktok titled: “how i’m spending my cerb money,” user jason chen flashes a wish list of items, such as a louis vuitton wallet and alexander mcqueen sneakers.  andrew stewart joked in a post that college kids in debt will instead spend their cerb cheques on a nba2k20 video game or gucci designer belts, while christina nguyen highlighted her pandemic purchase of a nintendo switch in a post titled “quarantine makin’ me mad cash.”

yes that, and the title certainly make me feel that this is a well structured peer reviewed research study or survey that has been conducted by bnn bloomberg. neither of those are meant to anger up the blood of folks to get clicks. i'm sure that there are a select number of people who are in a position to use their cerb money for whatever they want without having to use it however the government wants (which has always been a very conservative idea when applied to the wealthy or businesses, so i'm sure most of these kids fit) but not when its money directed to the average or low income individual. if some kid spent 200$ on a bag, i feel thats a waste but less upset than a govt company spending 200k on a retreat or being paid 2 mil for a job someone else would have competently done of 1.

you will always have a small section of people, from all walks of life, who will abuse or misuse soccial saftey benefits. does that mean that the larger majority who needs it or makes use of it properly should lose it? if so, lets jack corporate taxes back up to 80% to deal with companies who under pay and dodge taxes. conservatives who think in this manner have an unusuall supporter in the form of vi lenin who was quoted as saying that it would be better to put a 1000 innocent men to death than to sufffer 1 \"parasite\" (someone who \"wont contribute\") to live (well im paraphrasing as i'm on my way to work and dont want to sift through my bookshelf)

my original comment was on the rights of people to a basic income over exploitive work in mininmum or below minimum wage jobs, am i expected to think that teenagers using cerb to purchases things like louie vitton purses are the teens working at mcdonalds 20 to 40 hours a week? are these kids who have to worry about their parents not being able to afford a roof over their head? maybe, maybe not, but not likely. sorry some well off kids got free money, maybe they'll eventuslly be successful and give it back in the form of taxes, isnt that how this is supposed to work?. im not bothered by a poor or rich kid having a few nice things.

also having my daughters show me a few trends on tic toc, id say we should be more concerned, numbers wise, about kids lighting their farts on fire unsafely, organizing tode pod swallowing parties, and doing really awful dance moves (i feel for club owners and employees 6 to 10 years in the future). we can get around to cerb spending sprees maybe after dealing with these problems?",conservatives

similarly, and this is a relatively extreme talking point, but fixed monetary fines as punishment in essence just make something that rich people can do freely if they are willing to absorb the cost.

rational reasons i can think of include things like:

canada post: notoriously strong union, extremely high impact if a labour disruption occurs, unrealistic to impose a policy such as this against a strong union on a short time line

armed forces: military senior leadership recommending that the policy not be applied to the forces, likely for operational considerations (not saying their reasons are necessarily gold, but if that's their recommendation to the mod, then i expect the government to adopt that recommendation). 

call center employees: already work 100% remotely, hard/impossible to strongly defend why vaccination should be required by the employer if challenged by the union

etc., etc.

the policy *obviously* was only going to be implemented on employee groups where the public service could advise the cabinet that it was both realistic to gather the data, provide some measure of enforcement, and have low risk of union intervention/low operational impact in the event of labour action. anyone who thought otherwise doesn't understand the real world very well.",liberals

well no.  he registered a party.. anyone can do that. but it's pretty obvious that he didn't build a party in one year. his election efforts were basically him, with virtually no ground organization or even any cohesion in messaging or efforts. all the stuff that make a party, he didn't have. 

&gt;. now they're polling similar to the green party in some polls 

you mean the green party that's in the middle of complete de-cohesion and is tearing itself apart? the party everyone's looking at like a complete joke?  

yeah - not the ruler i'd use. when lizzie was at her peak she was still somewhat comical but she put seats on the board and at least won her own riding. she'd get 7 percent of the vote or better (or at least be polling that high aggregate).  the aggregate for the ppc is about 2.5. you can't really even call it a party at this point. we'll see what happens. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; the ppc will be a pain in the side of the cpc and keeping them honest 

quite the opposite. they will push the cpc closer to the center to pick up any lost vote. there's lots of room there with trudeau leaning to the left like that. so - if anything the ppc will help reduce conservatism in the canadian political landscape.  oh the irony. 

bernier is no different that the libertarian party. they show up at election time long enough to beg for enough money to keep going and syphon off a few votes. they run a full slate or close to and have (or did, don't know what their current status is) for many elections. but they never achieved a damn thing.",liberals

ukrainians are white now but were not until the 50s or so. italians, greeks, scots/irish, polish etc etc. there were many ethnic groups that came to canada and within a few generations became ‘white’.

in single transferable vote (stv) each riding elects multiple representatives, using ranked ballots. so in a three-member riding for example, in order to ‘win’, a candidate needs a minimum of 33% of the votes. and based on the ranked votes of the voters, the end result is a group of representatives that closely matches the popular vote in the riding.
