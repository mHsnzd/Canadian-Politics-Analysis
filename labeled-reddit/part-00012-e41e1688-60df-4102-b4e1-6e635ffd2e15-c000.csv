&gt;as this study puts forward evidence that the canadian government was not fully prepared for this pandemic, we proposed areas of further research on early response plans and their effects for canada. this included but was not limited to **the effectiveness of mass school closures and international border closures on reducing viral transmission**, region-specific pandemic controls, as well as the importance of timing for testing and case tracing. early responses are also a very cost-efficient and time-efficient way to take control of a pandemic. to avoid unnecessary and exacerbated outcomes, early response is an important topic of research.

&gt;  
&gt;i hope the irony isn't lost on you that this article talks about not treating the other side as evil, inhuman, monsters ... and here you are.

the problem with trying to \"both sides\" the issue is that more often than not it's a false equivalency. conservatives of all stripes in canada for years have made statements that are disparaging towards myself, my friends, my family, and many of my colleagues. attitudes of \"family values\" and xenophobia are divisive, and when they are allowed to fester for long enough result in violence. we have seen the direct result of this in canada many times in the past, and have witnessed terrorist acts at the hands of right-wing ideologues again and again, including several times last year alone.

me saying \"don't be divisive and love everyone regardless of who they are\" is not itself a divisive statement. i don't have a problem with people who don't have a problem with me, but if you are going out into the world and saying bad shit about muslims or immigrants or black people then yeah, i'm gonna tell you to stop. and if you want me to stop speaking out about those issues, then stop making them issues.

&gt; i've been around the block and it is a common tired trope for opposition to link the conservative parties (provincial or federal) with the current republican president whoever he is. harper (with his secret agenda - remember that one?) was bush, and of course, scheer/ford/o'toole is trump. at this point, it's a joke. i know what you're doing. you know what you're doing. why are we playing this game? 

i mean sometimes the resemblance is pretty uncanny. remember kelly leitch and her \"canadian values test\" that she wanted immigrants to take before they could move here? none of the values on that test that she was attributing to canadian culture were canadian at all, and were closely linked to american conservative ideology. most canadians are not particularly bothered by multiculturalism or religious diversity, and a majority prefer some level of state-provided services such as healthcare. i can't think of a single canadian in the past year who would actually want what the us has anyways. it's a divided and fractured country that's declining into oblivion in real time, not particularly an inspiring role model to be followed.

o'toole similarly has directly pulled from trump by [accusing his largest political opponent of trying to rig the next election](https://thinkpol.ca/2021/01/08/canadas-conservatives-under-fire-for-promoting-election-rigging-conspiracy-theories-echoing-trump/), which is [exactly what trump did months earlier](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-accuses-democrats-rigging-november-election-during-nevada-rally-n1239969). they are attempting trump's strategy of energizing the voter base with this kind of phony rhetoric, while also ensuring that if they lose the next election that they have a reason for it - because it was rigged to begin with.

like forgive me for seeing a direct causal relationship here, but it's played out for years with multiple different conservative politicians (not just leaders and not even just within the cpc - bernier being a good example of this) and it is always a few months delay before canadian conservaties start doing the same thing. never do i see american conservatives mimicking the strategy of canadian conservatives, it is always a one way causal relationship.",conservatives

&gt;however i do see i have 2 votes in my comment which probably means whoever is following along is downvoting you and upvoting me.

not based :c

let me get my copium just a sec.........

much better! ok, lets go

&gt;we don’t need to imagine. we know what happened with this exact instance. abortions went underground. the people passionate about women’s right to choose found alternative means to provide it. 

[in poland actually like very recently riots broke out due to the laws on abortion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvnq-25suik) the people didnt just simply go underground. no, they started becoming more violent. may i say \"demestic terrorists.\" (yes that counts as domestic terrorism, just not in any way compareble to the real terrorists that haunt the world) but that is my point, except the crazy part was, the pro-choice people did have a bigger voice than social conservatives do in canada. the real worrying part is, if that is the case. then you know how bad it could get over here right with conservatives?

the problem is the right will have no problem with calling that situation in poland domestic terrorism. but the left will. the reason is because the left sees this as an important issue for them. the right doesnt see having a pro-choice situation in their country as a good thing. rather the opposite. so they are willing to call them terrorists.

its much harder to find \"principled\" right wing terrorism, due to the nature of social conservatism being rooted in christianity. those who are specially very principled would find it very hard to justify violence. but those in the far right dont have to  really deal with this problem. so they are willing to become very violent. so if one shifts from conservative to nazi, that is why its worrying.

&gt;and this raises a fundamental problem and exposes the right which is that their ideas that they are passionate about are almost always oppressive in nature which is why a right wing example of this doesn’t really exist.

this is why i think, that the left(im assuming you are in the left, correct me if im wrong), doesnt listen to the right. let me give you a big right wing issue i have already brought up. abortion.

conservatives see the situation as genocide, they are very sensitive to this subject. when i talk to passionate pro-choice christian types. what they typically say something like this.

\"these people are crazy, how are they even able to justify sych a horrible tragedy? will they not cry if millions of children are hurt around the world while they are alive? why dont they have the same view of children in the womb? why do they think this is just a joke? this is just demonic\"

the problem is you havent understood the other side. which i will not blame you for, even the right has the same problem. as a centrist, its easier for me to deal with this issue and see both sides. but when you are that principled, its harder to see the other side.

right wingers see you as \"baby genocide supporters\" the same way you see them as \"extremists wanting to oppress women\". this is why its soooo important to talk. you dont see them, they dont see you. you will never see each other if you refuse to give an eye and ear because you see the other side as evil.

the facts are that both of you think, that the other side just wants to oppress the innocent. both of you have real good points. 

the best way to find a solution is to come together and with us ***enlightened centrists*** lets really find a solution to these problems!

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;they literally do say that. all the right does is talk about how violent blm is. does it make them mad? probably not.

ahhhh, yes they do. that is the problem. that doesnt do anything does it? them calling blm just terrorists instead of engaging in convosation will help nobody eh? that is why you must listen to each other, and stop calling each other satans, terrorist oppressors.

even if something is true, like a group acting like terrorists. its more productive to actually engage in conversation, not allowing terrorism to become part of a movement. 

&gt;they already can speak. the biggest political news stations are right wing. the biggest internet political podcasts and you tubers are right wing. they are all extremely well funded. right wing speech is far more available than left wing speech and yet here you are asking they get more(?)

maybe in some other countries.

but in canada there are no major socially right wing news stations. most are either center or left.

there are far more leftists content creators, than the opposite. yes i know there are people like joe rogan. but the left has much more power in that area due to most of the creative folk, tending to be left leaning.

now in america the right does have much more of a stronghold. but this isnt the case in canada. i mean even our cpc leader isnt pushing for really any socially right wing policies. surprisingly thats even the case with the ppc.

any way, thats not even the point. it isnt about voicing your opinions in the internet. 

the internet is toxic, and rarely if ever helps people get into understanding each other. the algorithm is built in a way, to avoid such things.

this is why we need dialog, and open convo here in canada, in the streets, in universities, and all over.

the *real* reason r/onguardfortheee was created is far more pathetic than most people know. 

there was this lolcow called \"harvo\" who joined metacanada in the early days (we're talking 2011 here) except he was a real loser about it. for some reason he was particularly fixated on the metacanada founder barosa. 

because he was such an awkward loser, he was quickly ostracised and ultimately banned. from there, he's been waging a personal war with metacanada to make them sorry they rejected his friendship. ([his craziness is all centred around having \"friends\"](https://i.imgur.com/vg3ahsz.png). we're guessing it's because he doesn't have many irl)

one of the things he did was create his own subreddit (ongaurdforthee). the idea being, if he could get a higher subscriber count, he'd have more \"friends\" than barosa and he'd \"win\".

this clearly didn't satisfy his obsession. [he's not a stable individual](https://i.imgur.com/xdtsurn.png) as i'm sure you can tell.

yeah no probs, always willing to discuss.

&gt;i don't associate conservatism with nazism. nazism politically exists in a completely different spectrum here. and i don't want to automatically lump them all together.

thank you for that, its annoying when conservatives often do the you know \"oh you support ubi, get out of muh country you commie\" both sides can easily fall into that hole. so its great that you dont do that!

&gt;the issue is, in canadian politics, only one party currently has members courting these types of people. that does create an unfortunate link between canadian conservatives and nazism, whether the conservatives or conservatives wish to accept that or not.  
&gt;  
&gt;than conservatives have to make a concerted effort to remove these cancers from their own midst.

i didnt hear of cpc bringing in nazis to their party. would appreciate if you could link me that incident. would like to get into it cause that is worrying if true, no doubt. thanks! :d

&gt;this is sort of victim blaming. \"if you didn't tell the nazi's to go away, they wouldn't be nazi's!\". and it brings us to the paradox of intolerance. when you tolerate intolerance, you allow intolerance to spread. allowing nazi's to voice their opinions allows nazism to spread. giving them the \"its ok to speak your nazi hatred\" will have greatre impact of spreading the hate than if they stewed on their own. which leads to the next point.

well this is the problem. extremism, and political violence/terrorism can easily be created in both sides, through the failings to listen.

remember the abortion riots in poland, and blm riots in america? when i tell people in the right to listen to them, which could easily cut off some of the violence. im in no way victim blaming, im warning them

just like that left wing violence, so can right wing violence happen. both happen because one side doesnt feel heard. that right there is the problem. i think you would agree that the blm riots happened due to the reason of them feeling that they had no one listening to them. 

right wingers can cry \"well they should stop being terrorists extremists\" all they want. but that isnt gonna fix the issue. 

so does the same apply for the opposite side. 

&gt;i do have pity for those who fall to extremism. even more so when it's canadians. we are a rich nation who have the means to ensure that every single canadian gets a good education. good access to quality of life to help prevent indoctrination. this is our failing that we let them fall through the cracks.

the funny thing is those who fall into extremism, are almost always those who are more privileged. this is why, just having a good quality of life never puts a block to extremism. almost all the rioters in portland who riot daily, arent impoverished black folk. no they are rich white kids. 

so is the same with right wing extremism. 

the best way to avoid violence is through dialectic. listening to each other. making sure both sides feel heard, remembering that even if we disagree. in the end of the day, we are both humans, who see the world differently. but still want to improve each others lives. if you want to go more in depth to what im saying im gonna put down a reply i gave to someone else also. to go into specifics if that helps. 

\\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

looks like [breachmedia.com](https://breach.com) was using misleading language then, because other sources make it clear that the money was for cleaning up abandoned wells, not restarting them (hence why it was endorsed by *greenpeace*).

tbh the article seems to make a lot of misleading statements without providing context, not the best sign for their credibility, as a brand new website.

&gt;and why should the public have to foot the bill for this?

orphan wells are from companies that have gone bankrupt.  who else would pay for it?

but going forward, i do think the rules should be changed (at the provincial level) to require oil drillers to pay into a fund in advance, that would later be used to clean up the wells.

&gt;why, when the government is picking winners and losers, are they picking fossil fuel companies as the winners here?

very much this.  similar to the myth of jobs being created by giving money to the employers - jobs are created when there's a job to be done... doesn't matter how much money the employer has.  in fact, if they have money, and no job needs to be done, they're quite happy to not create more jobs considering it's just money they're pissing away.  conversely, if investors decide to take their money elsewhere, someone else would come if there's money to be made.

that said, billionaires have nothing but time and have worked for several decades to make the western nations favourable for them.  they'll have no problem suffering in the short term if it would force governments to change to suit their needs.  imo, there needs to be a system, especially if basic income really does become a thing like the liberals are allegedly proposing, that would prevent a business from benefiting from the increased buying power of canadians if they're not paying taxes in canada ie: don't let amazon sell in canada while they're using the irish hq loophole.

obviously, environmental groups will advocate for the clean-up of orphan wells. they are massive emitters of greenhouse gases. it’s better the public pay for it then it to not get cleaned up at all. 

and not all orphan wells are abandoned due to bankruptcy. there’s plenty of reasons. sometimes they are even abandoned indefinitely until viability improves. 

either way, the industry as a whole should be paying for the cleanup of the wells. that’s not exactly a new idea. that’s how insurance works. i understand that that some level of compromise is necessarily to establish that and the public will necessarily have to pay for some of it, but, as it stands, the industry is not compensating the public anywhere near what they should be. if we are going to rely on companies to stay out of bankruptcy by the end of the well’s lifetime then that’s an incredible failure by the government and clearly a complete lack of proper regulation. whether the regulations are federal or provincial shouldn’t matter, so long as they can be held up in court. fossil fuel extraction’s impact isn’t limited by provincial borders.

gp8xeco,2021-02-28T08:29:13.000-08:00,"could gummed up bills in the house of commons trigger a federal election? elizabeth may figures she can somehow take the seat of power from trudeau by crossing party lines. how do i figure this? well, aside from that brilliant mouthpiece from her...  


right now she is presented with a possibility. that possibility is that she can bring green votes to the liberal side by crossing party lines for one. this is only possible, likely at all, because of the narrative shift occurring in canada right now. green is good in the minds of many who are liberal voters. liberal voters also tend to like her compared to a lot of other party leaders. i would dare say she would be a 2nd choice to many, if we had such voting methods available to us such a proportional votes.   


now, look at the current situation. trudeau is holding on by the skin of his teeth. he's in a minority position, faced with the outlook of constant elections if he doesn't play the game perfectly. since no politician can play that game perfectly, it's a matter of time only, and the perfect time for any up and comers to start positioning for possible roles of power.   


enter elizabeth may. a potential solution to the liberal problem. she wouldn't be representing green party, which will be a winning position off the start for many people. (sorry greens, but you have too many radicals still, and may was the one thing keeping many of you somewhat reasonable looking.) and that last bit in parenthesis leads to the next part. she's actually usually pretty reasonable. i mean, comparatively speaking to many other party leaders. this is something a lot of people are going to prefer right now if they really must pick a leader in confusing times. someone who they can trust to at least try to be reasonable. this makes her a shoe in for replacing trudeau as an interim leader between him and whoever takes over after her role as pm (if she wins) or her role as liberal leader after a cpc win instead. note i don't say ndp at all here,  because they don't have a snowballs chance in even a cold hell let alone a hot hell. but, then again. they might have a snowballs chance in a hot hell, if she is instead going for the ndp leadership?   


it's interesting to think about, but she currently has a lot of cards in her favor right now. and that's without resorting to the \"first female liberal leader/pm\" label she could be going for. note, i didn't say first female pm, since cpc already had kim campbell hold mulroney's bag for them.",liberals

the official policies of reform in its early days centered on fiscal conservatism (\"eliminate the deficit\") and reform of institutions (\"triple-e senate\"), the latter being especially appealing to the west.

but during those early campaigns (1993 and 1997) a lot of the discourse focused on social-conservative issues, as there was a lot of activity at the policy conventions (anti-gay resolutions, etc.) and several of the mps or candidates had made headline-making comments about religious and ethnic minorities, gays, criminal punishment, etc.

i can tell you that in the 1990s, it was the social-conservative element of reform that was most at play in ontario. at least from my friends who were involved in volunteering for reform, that's what i heard about the most -- that reform would clamp down on immigration, go after the \"suburban gangs\", etc.",conservatives

and that doesn't include the additional $6 billion in loan guarantees, which makes it even worse. it's a ridiculous amount of money to spend per job actually created, and shows just how short sighted this government, and many of my fellow albertans, are. believing this was a good investment is insanity. and arguing that the federal government \"isn't doing enough\" is stupid, because biden was committed to canceling the damn thing. it's so frustrating too, because as others said, the ndp was actually doing a decent job diversifying, and if they'd been allowed to continue, likely would not have wasted our money like this. ugh.",liberals

let's see...the green number is consistent with previous polling, staying stable at 20%. this ndp number is far too high though, and would obviously transfer to either the greens or the libs come election day. 

pa number seems reasonable, only a few % lower than what it did in 2020 (9%), and even then, that last minute increase was a move away from higgs on election day (vs advance votes). 6% is around what they'd get right now i think. 

as for the pc vs lib numbers....i don't quite know what to make of it to be honest. higgs has hovered in the high 30s/low 40s since the pandemic due to his covid bump. since we're still in this pandemic, i don't see why this would falter. the pcs did perform at 39% and the liberals at 34% in 2020, so 32% for the libs seems right on the mark. 

but then, every time higgs opens his mouth or introduces a piece of legislation, he shows just out of touch he is with new brunswickers. it's why his numbers sank so much during the previous election campaign. literally the only thing that saved him was that his big covid bump acted as a buffer during his popularity decrease and he got a 2-seat majority as opposed to a bigger majority.

gjxqdwy,2021-01-19T20:06:25.000-08:00,"affordable housing for all canadians by 2030 - will cmhc's plan work? it's sad to see that the federal government still refuses to take the lead on addressing our housing bubble. instead, we're left with a smattering of lower level governments and agencies applying bandaid solutions, without the holistic leadership that the federal government should be providing.

more than anything else, i hope the opposition parties use the housing bubble to define trudeau's term. our economy is becoming more and more centered around people unproductively borrowing huge sums of money and trading houses. trudeau's gdp numbers look great, but they mask a host of problems.

i'm arguing that we should blame this on trudeau because he has a toolbox of policy initiatives he could be using to address the housing crisis holistically,  but he isn't. by holistically, i mean doing more than building some affordable housing while allowing the bubble to rage on. the government needs to implement policy that makes housing less attractive as an investment,  so people looking for a home aren't competing with people looking for investment returns. policies like: 

1. implementing a marginal tax rate on investment properties (i.e. 2% on your first, 4% on your second, 6% on your third) would still allow people to invest in real estate, but would encourage people to diversify their investment. 

2. give the rcmp more resources to fight money laundering, implement a national registry of beneficial ownership, and pursue unexplained wealth orders, similar to the uk. according to the bc government,  money laundering in 2008 alone caused home prices to increase by 5%.¹ that means if you pay $2000 a month on your mortgage or in rent, $100 is subsidizing the money laundering from 2008 alone! who knows what that is for other years?

3. end the capital gains exemption on primary residences. this will be the hardest politically,  but it's also one of the most important. the housing bubble has been an enormous wealth transfer from young people to older people, spiking wealth inequality across the country. these gains need to be shared.

these are all policies trudeau could pursue, but he doesn't. nobody should take him or his party seriously on inequality or inequity until he does.

&gt; in this case, jwr had performed poorly in her position even before snc

this is mr. trudeau's argument and it's very, very different from the claim made above which was that she was removed for making the \"wrong\" decision on snc.

the prime minister *does* have the power to replace the attorney general, just not for the reason of \"i told you to do something and you didn't do it\".   

now *if* you're correct, then it would be okay, but there are two glaring problems with that idea.  

* first is that mr. trudeau and the finance minister were *actively* engaging with her about the snc issue at the time and were not happy with her decision.  suddenly deciding at that point that she had to be removed for other reasons is deeply suspicious, somewhat like if the management of a firm suddenly fired an employee when they found out she was a union organizer, but claimed that the firing had nothing to do with her union organizing activities but were general job performance reasons that had just coincidentally never been mentioned until they found out about the union organizing.   it's *possible*, but quite suspicious.
* second is that the very first action her replacement in the role of attorney general did was decide he was going to fully review the snc decision with \"all options\" on the table.   that's *incredibly* suspicious.",liberals

i am not convinced enough voters would switch over to this new party from the left to make up for the loss of votes from a conservative split. now this could change with electoral reform but i am not convinced of electoral reform yet, although what is curious is that more cpc voters now support electoral reform than lpc voters after the 2019 election. [69% of cpc voters to 55% of lpc voters(angus reid pdf link](http://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/electoralreform.pdf)

i am also hesitant of some formats of electoral reform where we could end up like nations like israel or some european countries where no government can be formed and it's just election after election. our current system does provide a certain level of stability even if i am unhappy with the government. however, we are lucky in canada that regardless of who is in the government at the time that they are generally always competent.

a conservative split would ultimately lead to very little conservative policies being implemented and would likely just maintain liberal governments. as a cpc voter i genuinely believe conservative policies are better for canada and canadians so i am unlikely to think favourably of anything that would lead to cpc being in opposition forever more.

poilievre is a gotcha fb sharing machine for cons and who love the \"own the libs\" narrative. he usually widely misses the mark on questions, and edits the periods to get the shares, and likes. it's just fb marketing 101.

we all know that fb (not corporate fb). is a conservative hot bed. it was the breeding ground (and arguably still is) for qanon, and anti-vaxx, and many other fringe right movements. so it shouldn't come as a surprise where he is getting traction from.

where i could get behind him, is questioning real issues rather than the gotcha versions. i like his \"ben shapiro esque\" style, yet i hate his direction. he panders to the lowest form of voter, those who get their points of view from fb memes. 

as far as the fringe elements. if you go out in society you rarely will encounter many of these types. especially how they are portrayed online. these fringe groups are vocal minorities. for a example anti-vaxx is massive on fb, any vaccine post has 100s of dislikes, and many anti-vaxx comments. but statscan has done several surveys showing over 75% will get the vaccine.

eliminating whipped votes isn't the answer, but clearly there does need to be some more accountability. the most obvious solution that actually works is coalition governments. while liberal members will always answer to the liberal leader to some degree, other parties don't. coalition partners can be very effective in reigning in the power of prime ministers. consider in the netherlands where mark rutte's entire cabinet resigned a few weeks ago over a child benefits scandal. this happened because he lost the confidence of his coalition partners, there is little doubt that in canada such a scandal would have been ridden out and minimized. closer to home, i was very pleased with the ndp/green government in bc, and i think the new ndp majority will be much less accountable.",liberals

a budget is just a plan. no budget in the history of budgets has ever been perfect. there are always unforseen issues/complications that arise out of nowhere that have to be adapted to.


it feels like you're under the impression that she's saying that the government has been spending lots of money under the table and no one knows where our money is going mostly.


but what she's really saying is that the budget process has a lot of checks and balances that would have caught a lot of mistakes the liberals made with their pandemic spending. things like cerb going to prisonners, cews not paying enough initally, the whole we charity debacle etc etc could have all been sorted out by the budget approval process.


to me it comes across like you believe the government did the best job possible given the circumstances. there was no way for them to know or anticipate the problems they faced; the budget is a tool that could have helped them anticipate some of those problems. there's no guarantee it would have. but it wouldn't have hurt.


cbc marketplace did a segment on taiwan at the beginning of the pandemic to contrast the two governments handling of corona. because taiwan anticipated the type of issues that were likely to arise, they were able to avoid a lot of the same problems we faced early in the pandemic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srzv7ilhm4q

i know it feels like the pandemic came out of nowhere. but if taiwan could have the forsight to predict what would happen and take precautions. it shows it definitely was possible to prepare around the time they were creating the budget.

&gt;i guess overall my problem is that she is trying to make black and white points about a situation that is inherently grey. when i see \"our eyes are closed\" i think... \"hold up, i've been essentially following spending, and while it's definitely going crazy and i haven't been following every single dollar, i'm getting the general thrust of things.\" then again, i work for the feds and i have some (small) interest in seeing where the money goes (though more as it pertains to my specific institution).

i understand that you could interpret it that way, but thats not what she meant. she was referencing the expression \"eyes wide open.\"

eyes wide open is like if you took a baseball and whipped it at someone's face. if the person's eyes are open, they're much more likely to see the ball coming and react than they would if their eyes were closed.",liberals

gmmcn2x,2021-02-08T04:34:03.000-08:00,"here’s why moderna’s covid-19 vaccine shipments to canada have been delayed here's the answer to the question in the headline. it's not because the government got a bad deal. it's not because of trudeau himself. heck, it's not even on the provinces. turns out that demand is far above supply at the moment and that moderna is working on scaling up production - a temporary speed bump to hopefully even more vaccines on the way.

&gt; moderna’s delivery of covid-19 vaccines to canada has hit delays because the company has encountered problems with its european supply chain and restrictions on exports of vaccine supplies, the star has learned.",liberals

gmmig9s,2021-02-08T05:17:33.000-08:00,"buying a typical home in canada? cities now require incomes of up to $230,000 &gt;that's a very good point, but i don't see a homeowners thinking as a bloc on zoning in any particular area.

this is correct, of course. there are no homeowners rubbing their hands together thinking, 'if we just block this apartment building, it will restrict supply by 0.001%, thus boosting our home values by $4 based on estimated elasticities for the metro area'.

however, the mlas and councilors who make up these governments are much more informed. moreover, they are overwhelmingly homeowners themselves and largely come from fairly upscale backgrounds where everyone owns their own home. andrew wilkinson (bc liberals) perhaps demonstrated this most effectively when he [referred](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wilkinson-liberals-housing-wacky-rental-1.5037988) to renting as a 'wacky time in life'. he eventually walked back that remark, but it was revealing nonetheless. this is a big part of how we got where we are - prior to maybe 2015, increasing home values was just the government *doing its job* and it was widely celebrated.

&gt;upzoning neighborhoods in toronto where demand is highest won't be  opposed by homeowners in barrie or mississauga, so that negative  blowback would be very minor for the province, but it would a political  disaster for a municipal government.

i see where you are coming from here, but i have the exact opposite conclusion. of course, people living in barrie and mississauga don't care if some condos are built in toronto. but it's the material implications that are important. if a government was to force a major upzone of the city of toronto, it would actually significantly *increase* home values in the city. nimbys might not like it, but financially it would be great for the typical homeowner, who could now sell their house to an apartment developer. a wave of supply in the central city would instead crush home prices in the suburbs and exurbs as more people were able to live in the city. this is why the provincial government is never going to do this - while the average voter in mississauga doesn't think about the issue this way, their mlas understand it perfectly well. they are not going to make a policy decision that crushes the home values of their constituents. if you doubt it, simply ask them. john horgan, justin trudeau and doug ford have all emphatically stated that they won't do anything that affects people's home equity and they mean that.",liberals

gqqrivd,2021-03-12T06:59:45.000-08:00,"yukon election called for april 12th oooh, another election...

i won't be as hard on them as i have been on nb and bc for calling elections prematurely, since yukon was due to go to the polls by november 2021 anyway (current liberal government elected in november 2016). but i do wonder if it's not partly due to wanting to give the federal liberals the space to campaign in the fall. 

the only polling that's been done on yukon politics showed a tight three way race between the liberals, yukon party and ndp, with the ndp having a slight lead. curious to see what future polls will show and how it'll turn out on election day. 

can redditers from yukon tell me what they think the themes of this election will be? what are pressing issues other than covid?",liberals

they were the first government in canada to introduce a $15 minimum wage, they introduced unequalled labour protection laws, they were one of the first provinces to introduce a carbon tax, they beefed up lgbtq+ protections.  this notion that they're somehow a right wing party because they supported a pipeline is insane.  a pipeline that would have reduced emissions to boot, since that oil is still going to be shipped, it will just be shipped by truck now which is more emissions intensive.",liberals
