legault abandoned separatism mostly for electoral reasons and has made the bet that québec can work out a better deal for itself inside of canada by standing strong on québec nationalism. lots of former péquistes followed his path and many are caq staffers. the caq, by focusing on nationalism issues, has dethroned the pq. it has also dethroned the liberals on the economy - caq and liberals are moderate centre-right parties. 

and even beyond nationalism and the economy, legault is satisfying québécois by being a good administrator, being a good communicator, handling well covid, and just plain connecting with citizens. he's thought to be a breath of fresh air from the long years of liberal premiers, who tainted their tenures with arrogance and corruption. so this may explain why a good number of québec solidaire voters, who, unlike pq and plq voters, have literally nothing in common with the caq, support him.",liberals

&gt;the extremely minor tax burden felt by the poor will easily balance out by the tax rebate they get, along with every other government program for helping the poor. attacking that as making carbon pricing unfeasible is making a mountain out of a molehill especially compared to the extremely severe cost of climate change.

you want people to consume less, combined with other people stating they want people to eat less.

&gt;  
i think the issue here is that you don't understand at least two things:

it's you who doesn't understand, allow me to explain:

&gt;that some products (including food) are more carbon intensive than others.

correct, but people can't eat less, heat their homes less, etc.

&gt;low income people generally see money in their pocket from canada's carbon tax scheme

this is quickly becoming even less accurate than it originally was. the originally calculations as put forth by the government of canada left out all consumables and just focused on housing costs. as all other costs are passed onto the consumer, this cost burden has increased, and the break even is less likely. further, and again, 53% of canadians are paycheque-to-paycheque. the rebates certainly aren't handed out every 14 days.

&gt;the goal of carbon taxes on food (and everything else really) is not exactly to get people to consume less; it is to get people to consume less carbon intensive products.

except without noting what is and isn't carbon priced, people don't know. further, this pushes people to eat junk packaged food, where causes more health issues down the line.

&gt;anyway i get the feeling that you would benefit from answering questions you find challenging like the one i asked you, and then thinking about policy afterwards. eg. economics 101: higher price means people buy less of a thing  
true or false?

false. the principle of higher prices reducing consumption is only applicable to things that can be chosen from a market economy or skipped. luxury goods and entertainment are great examples. food is not. if a person needs 2,000 calories a day, they cannot limit themselves to 1,800. the selection may vary to get to the amount needed, but there is a bottom line where they cannot select any cheaper options. once the cheapest options are selected, they are victim to all price increases on those items.

except inflation and wage/price controls effects within a country are not determined by global trends, but the host country that implements those policies. high inflation only impacted countries with bad monetary policies that led to that inflation. germany's inflation rate between 1970-1990 for instance usually stayed between 2-4%, with only very brief 1-4 year periods where inflation briefly rose above that (but never exceeded 7%). in canada by contrast, inflation was constantly 10% or higher between 1975-1978 and 1980-1983 and didn't fall below 6% again until 1984-85. (inflation rates between 1973-1984 were also  constantly above 4%).",liberals

&gt;prime minister justin trudeau and his cabinet instead effectively suspended mcdonald by placing him on administrative leave right before the election, saying eyre would continue to serve as acting defence chief for the time being.

&gt;“i am quite disappointed that my exoneration has not seen my return to duty,” 

&gt; “instead, now two months since the investigation conclusions were disclosed, the process under way to bring the situation to a close remains unknown to me. this leaves me concerned whether this unknown process will respect the due process assumed to underpin military, public service, and canadian culture generally.”

&gt; the liberal government has faced calls not to reinstate mcdonald, with some experts and victims’ advocates questioning the decision to have military police, rather than civilian authorities, lead the investigation.

&gt;these experts and advocates have suggested this casts doubt on the veracity of the investigation, and that mcdonald does not now have the moral authority to lead the military in changing its culture.

and when the civilian authority finds the same thing, perhaps an 'approved' exoneration will result in his reinstatement.

okay the allegations are serious, but this piece is more revealing i think. why would you put the guy whos head of hr in the position of dealing with complaints? that sounds like a conflict of interest, human resources is there to protect the institute, not the workers, and putting the boss of hr in charge of harassment complaints just ends any stream of complaints cause complaining threatens your career.

caution is required with broad-brush approaches as otherwise you end up taxing legitimate \"empty homes\" such as cottages and cabins.

to be fair, something big happened between february 2020 and october 2020, which shifted the public's attention...

in februrary 2020 when the blockades were happening, polls did show the bc ndp losing support.  it was a very polarizing issue - either you support the protesters, or you think the railway blockades are unacceptable and need to end.

the bc ndp were stuck in the middle (supporting the cgl project, but not coming down hard on the blockades either), so they were getting squeezed from both sides, bleeding votes to the bc greens and bc liberals, who were both up in the polls (the bc greens reached all-time highs around 23%).

then the blockades came down and covid hit in march and became the #1 focus of attention by far... so the blockades slipped out of people's minds.  the bc ndp were seen as handling covid well in 2020, so they shot up in the polls and won big in october 2020 at their snap election.

the progressive conservatives were nearly wiped out in parliament and chose to merge with the reform/alliance party in a naked bid to regain power. plenty of people still see the cpc as the spiritual successor to the pc’s, when in reality the pc’s were absorbed by the reform party and the cpc is quite openly socially conservative from the bottom up, although the current and former leader will do their best to try to convince you otherwise. they’ve voted not to recognize, as a party, that climate change exists and they’re constantly trying to bring up abortion and lgbtq issues for legislation on “moral” (read: religious) grounds despite those issues being very much settled in the minds of the vast majority of canadians. luckily it’s starting to become obvious to more and more people that the cpc are just the reform party and as a result entirely unelectable.

using the droop quota, a seat would take 16.6%+1 votes to get a seat. and keep in mind the ridings are now 5× larger.

current ridings have on average 60k voters. with turnout, that usually comes out to around 200k votes cast in an election. you would need over 30k votes to get a seat. keep in mind that most current mps get around 15k votes. 

realistically what would happen is the pcs and reform parties split up. one can cater to their western socons, while the pcs attack more moderate urban and eastern ridings. the liberals remain as they are because they have brand. the ndp become a viable option. the bloc mosrly stays the same. and then the green gets some minor relevence probably.

&gt; for nearly a month, the two had been talking back and forth, ever since leblanc had heard through the new brunswick political grapevine — including sources close to the mp’s family — that atwin wasn’t all that happy in the green party.

at their first meeting, not long after their first contact:

&gt; it didn’t take leblanc long to get down to business at this first meeting with her. he asked atwin in the course of this initial, 90-minute encounter if she’d be interested in joining the liberals. “i asked her to consider what she could do for fredericton inside the government caucus,” leblanc said.
&gt;
&gt; atwin didn’t say yes right away, but she didn’t say no either, so the conversations continued by phone throughout the end of may and early june. 

based on the timing, it sounds like what kicked this off was the increasingly bitter rift within the green party over the israeli-palestinian conflict. atwin made a public statement via twitter criticizing the green party stance on may 11, annamie paul's senior advisor fired back via facebook on may 14, and things deteriorated from there.

it sounds like the \"big tent\" nature of the liberal party was helpful:

&gt; during their many conversations, [leblanc] said, atwin told him that she’d been quietly able to work across party lines with several liberal mps and ministers from around the gta. one mp in particular, nate erskine-smith from beaches-east york, had made an impact on atwin because he hasn’t always automatically voted with his party, leblanc said.",liberals

hke20li,2021-11-12T06:47:19.000-08:00,"ontario liberals pledge to cancel highway 413, use money to build, repair schools instead honestly, i just want more places built like bloor/danforth corridor (between dufferin and victoria park) in toronto, especially now that bloor/danforth has been converted from a high speed road down to a slower street with separate bike lanes.  the streets in these areas are a destination, not just a route to get to a destination, and the blocks between the main streets have multiple different living opportunities, from fully detached, to semi-detached, to townhouses, to medium density apartments, all built side by side.  the back streets are narrow and tree-lined, making for slower vehicle traffic and much safer and more pleasant walking and biking opportunities, and since everything is close together and small shops and variety stores are sprinkled throughout, walking actually becomes a feasible way to get somewhere rather than a chore.  despite being mostly single family detached and semi-detached houses, areas like riverside or christie pits still manage to house nearly 8000 people per square km, yet do so in a way that can be sustained through taxes and are more than dense enough to justify transit options.  the only thing missing from the bloor/danforth corridor that i'd really like to see added is more separated biking infrastructure (some areas are still just painted gutters), a de-emphasis on cars on some north/south streets so that their use case looks more like bloor/danforth itself, and some better transit options, whether that's a new east/west line further south, or more streetcars and trams travelling north/south on some of those larger streets once they've been redeveloped to de-emphasize car traffic, just so that transit is still convenient for people further away from the main corridor.  despite critics complaining that these neighborhoods are zoned for single family homes and should be replaced with condos, these low-medium rise, densely built neighborhoods still achieve a population density close to that of singapore.

smaller cities like that would absolutely make sense, as long as they were designed properly.   there are smaller cities in ontario, but most were built around vehicle dependency (for example, london, on has a abysmal density of ~1000 people per square km, despite having a population over 300 000, and is nearly impossible to navigate without a car).  if these small cities could be built to a density of around 4000-5000 people per square km then walking, bicycles, and even streetcars can be the most convenient option for in-city trips, saving cars for trips outside the city, or for in-city trips where bikes and transit aren't feasible.  if these nodes are built with big parking lots and widely spaced amenities however then they'd still probably run into traffic issues fairly quickly (again, see london).

when talking about infrastructure, the costs should also incorporate the distance from the source.  if someone in riverdale flushes a toilet, it only needs to travel through about 3km of pipes before it hits the treatment plant, whereas if somebody on the outskirts of brampton flushes a toilet it needs to travel through nearly 25km of pipes (and probably be lifted a couple of times to keep it moving downhill) to hit the nearest treatment plant.  same thing with treated water, roads, power, etc.  i have no idea how the linked report came up with those numbers but my guess is that costs are probably amortized over the number of people served and the distance traveled, so low density suburbs far from downtown requires that the network be extended, but there are very few taxpayers to actually cover the additional maintenance required to maintain the network expansion.  smaller cities likely don't see as large a delta for new builds because those builds are still close to the source or destination, but by building low density areas close to the city it means the next expansion will be that much farther away and require that much more network expansion to even reach.  even then, smaller cities still require government transfers to remain solvent.  i had a look at guelph's financial statements and taxes and user fees only cover 73% of the city budget.  the rest comes from the province, the feds, and from developer fees.

i want to see cities where any mode of transportation is a valid option, rather than ones where driving is the only option.  i live in toronto and still drive my car for most trips just because there's no bicycle infrastructure nearby aside from sharing narrow lanes with cars and buses only stop by my neighborhood every 30 minutes or so, but if separated bike lanes are installed i'll be buying a cargo bike to handle grocery trips.  i really hope those bike lanes come to fruition because i was already burned once when transit city was cancelled, leaving bus service as unreliable and unfeasible for most trips.",liberals

the issue though is that corporate taxes don't actually result in significant revenue gains. their contributions to revenue are marginal and actually tend to slightly reduce overall revenue levels. (there's a good article about it here on economist stephen gordon's [blog](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/03/cit.html)) beyond that, as mentioned in the sources provided in my last post, their rate cuts didn't actually make a difference in the revenue gained by the tax.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;cutting coporate tax rates to \"spur investment\" has proven to be a farce.

that tends to be a poor argument for maintaining the corporate tax rate. the main goals of the corporate tax are as a revenue tool and as a progressive form of taxation to collect more money from rich people. in terms of the taxes effects, it fails in both regards.

as a revenue tool, it's contributions are marginal and higher corporate tax rates tend to depress overall revenues compared to lower and non existent corporate tax rates, while in terms of progressiveness between 20-70% of the tax's incidence/burden falls on labor (low and middle income workers) making it's effects partially regressive.

&gt;the rates need to be increased and the loopholes closed or we will have no choice but to cut services.

corporate revenues haven't fallen as a percentage of federal revenue or gdp since the early 80s when the rate was 39%. their contribution is small and has generally always been small in canada.  likewise, the corporate tax can always be replaced by taxes that are both more effective and progressive.

a federal land value tax that collected between 3-5% of the value of land in canada would collect between $125 to $215 billion in 2019/20. it would also be much more progressive, reducing the tax burden of the average citizen but increasing the revenue collected by the wealthy/ultra wealthy.

likewise, eliminating gst exemptions would double gst revenues without raising the rate. that would generate an extra $39 billion in federal revenue.

the corporate tax by comparison marginally depresses revenue, so the $50 billion generated by the tax at 15% would not disappear if the tax was abolished, the difference would likely just be absorbed by other revenue sources.  for example:

* in 1980, the corporate tax was 39% and collected 2.5% of gdp in revenue or about $7.47 billion (14% of federal revenues)
* in 1990, the corporate tax was 28% and collected 2% of gdp in revenue or around $14.88 billion (12.43% of federal revenues)
* in 2000 , the corporate tax rate was around 28% and collected 2.3% of gdp in revenue or about $21.39 billion in 2000 (11% of federal revenues)
* in 2007, the corporate tax had been lowered to about 21% and was collecting 2.1% of gdp or about $38.53 billion (15.89% of federal revenues)
* in 2019, the corporate tax is 15% (with the rate paid by small businesses lowered to 9%) and collects around $50 billion (15.2% of federal revenues)

throughout that time, the corporate tax has consisted of similar percentages of gdp and similar percentages of federal revenues even with a 24% difference in rate.  that tends to illustrate it's redundancy as a revenue tool.",conservatives

hothhav,2021-12-16T03:31:33.000-08:00,"trudeau government committing $1 billion to help provinces — and maybe cities — get rid of handguns you're right that nobody needs a car, but society has determined that the benefit outweighs the safety risk. it does have a non-lethal benefit as it's primary purpose and literally millions of people benefit from using them every day. 

you're not quite correct about alcohol though, it's primary purpose is not to kill. it was not invented for that purpose, it's not produced for that purpose, people who do kill or die from alcohol do not intend for death to occur before consuming the alcohol. 

again, as i said above i'd love to see alcohol more restricted. i'm hoping that self-driving cars significantly reduce the non-self injury and death done by alcohol in our society, as well as the damage done by people driving too. of course it doesn't stop the fighting or domestic abuse portion of problems caused by alcohol, but i'll take what i can get given that prohibition is impossible due to how simple it is to make and how many people refuse to give it up. 

we regulated the shit out of tobacco, it's also not designed to kill. the cancer is a side effect, not the goal. many older smokers were not even aware of the medical implications when they started, and smoking rates have been dropping for decades. 

more than 500sqft living space... not sure how that has to be a killer. it's totally possible for us to live carbon neutral at greater than 500 sqft of living space, especially in the provinces that are already generating most (if not all) of their electricity from clean sources. bc, ontario, quebec... and again, as we've realized this is bad the government has been regulating like crazy to move towards reducing carbon outputs. 

2000 calories a day, that one does kill a lot of people, but it only kills the person who is doing it to themselves. gun suicide is a problem, but it's gun violence that's worrying. obesity violence against others isn't an issue that i'm aware of.",liberals

the argument i'm making is that a lot more people are affected by the latter than the former, and have been since the inception of the catholic schools systems, and if the criticisms being directed at quebec for bill-21 have any credible foundation then those same criticisms should be made against our catholic schools.

that there is virtually no coverage of catholic school discrimination in the conversation of bill-21 tells me that the criticisms aren't coming from a place of good faith, they're being generated as politically fashionable for politicians or anger inciting for our english media.

there's a principle in argumentation that you should try to think about the things your interlocutor says as if they were said by someone who really understands your point and nevertheless disagrees with it. i don't think you're doing that, here. i think you're just endlessly repeating the same trite observations and yelling: \"hypocrite! hypocrite!\" as if that invalidates the basic point that we should have the election later rather than sooner.

be easy, friend. hopefully you have a nice life and so forth. but i'm done arguing with you because it feels like yelling at graffiti you don't like: it just keeps saying the same thing and it can't hear you.",liberals

this situation is analogous to the united states. the united states, the federal ndp, the u.s. states, and the provincial ndp parties all have their own constitutions. every citizen of a u.s. state is a citizen of the united states as a whole, and all u.s. states must abide by the u.s. constitution. in fact, provincial ndp parties have *more* autonomy than u.s. states, since the provincial parties can unilaterally sever their ties with the national party, whereas u.s. states cannot secede from the united states.

however, it would be silly to claim that the state governments are the same single political entity as the united states, just as it is silly to claim that the provincial ndp parties are the same single organization as the federal ndp.",liberals

hnqgbfx,2021-12-08T00:36:15.000-08:00,"can blowing up canada’s political parties save us? &gt;\\&gt; in theory, a party ought to form around a set of principles for dealing with problems: employment, education, climate and so on. in practice, like the americans, our own parties are far more interested in power. so they tell us what they think we want to hear, and try to put as many people as possible under their proverbial big tents. as groucho marx once famously said, “those are my principles, and if you don’t like them… well, i have others.\"

i disagree with this principle. as i scientist, my motto is that to succeed in life you should fall in  love with the problem and not the solution. you go with whatever solution to the problem works, and have the wisdom to understand that this can change with time. you go with what works no matter who comes up with it or what pet theory or \"principal\" of ideologues it violates. if it does not correspond to the practical limits and facts of the problem, you discard them like provincial senates. if it still serves a purpose, you keep it, like our westminster parliamentary system.

ideological parties lack empathy and the ability to see things from other points of view. they become clubs, echo chambers for the like-minded, and isolated from reality. they fall in love with their own very limited simplistic solutions, and approach every problem with the view that if only we all thought like them and beleived in their \"principles\", we'd al be better off. ideology is anathema to democracy.

that's why ideally, parties would be abolished in representative democracy. mp's should be representing the interest of their constitutents which are diverse and complex , not the ideologies or leaders of their party (which tend to be monolithic and simple). they could get together in truly independent parliamentary committees. people should have personal principles and integrity, not parties.

i realize that is impractical and would never work, though, so big-tent, pragmatic parties are the next best thing as they are the most flexible in their thinking and more open to diverrsiy and multiple points of view on complex, difficult problems, and most likely to find the best practical solutions. that's why i (and a large segment of canadians) tend towards the liberal party as they match my non-doctinaire, pragmatic approach to real-life problems.

 it's like jean chretien said about being stuck in the snow with the meech debacle:

&gt;\"you remember when everybody was trapped in the debate on the distinct society, \\[i said\\] 'we're stuck in the snow.... what do we do when we're stuck in the snow? relax, \\[move\\] a little bit forward, a little bit backward, and eventually you're back on the road,\"' he said. \"everybody was furious with me saying things like that, but it turned out that i was right.... i knew that the guy in shawinigan didn't give a damn.\" https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/chr%c3%a9tien-predicts-common-sense-will-prevail-in-quebec-debate-over-religious-symbols-1.4850386",liberals

the important point is that elasticity of goods is a core concept to examining whether carbon taxes will be effective in their goals. the user that started this chain of comments said that carbon-intensive products are price inelastic and so carbon taxes are useless. 

i don't know if that statement is true, i feel like its wrong though as i'd bet most carbon-intensive goods are not inelastic. my comment was simply in response to yours, which you said elasticity was irrelevant. 

if &gt;&gt;if&lt;&lt; carbon-intensive products are predominantly inelastic goods, then carbon taxes will have less impact on them. the very definition of an inelastic good is one which price changes have little impact on demand, so if their statement is true, then the carbon tax will have less effect.",liberals

the majority of the atlantic provinces success (especially pei and newfoundland) is almost entirely geographical in nature; incredibly smaller, and less porous borders; less international entry points; less routes at the borders, etc. like for us to not have done as well as we have would almost definitely have required sheer malice or contempt at the government level. even ford could have done reasonably well if he was an atlantic premier, and that’s saying something.

i've never worked for the ndp either, but the ndp grassroots people i've interacted with haven't made a good impression. they tend to combine liberal sanctimony with tory victim mentality and liberal-obsession. this isn't a criticism of their policies, but i find that it makes them hard to relate to.",liberals

imo it's honestly interesting because the opioid crisis has hit small city and rural canada - i.e. the conservative base - particularly hard, and their proposals are reflecting it. i don't really trust them to do anything specific, but since it hits their base, i'd imagine their budgets would include money for it. easy to give money, harder to implement real programs (as the ndp would).",conservatives
