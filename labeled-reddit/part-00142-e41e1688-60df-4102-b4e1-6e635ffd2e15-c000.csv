sadly for you it was the truth and you repeating its not the truth over and over doesn't make it true.

&gt;maybe - and virtually all political models would argue that their vision of it is best. but that's not what you said - you said it was a hallmark of the conservative ideology that you consider families. it isn't. it's universal. so you were wrong - it doesnt' distinguish conservationism from any other model does it. it's like saying \"conservatives are pro-breathing.

do you understand that conservatives seek to protect the family defined in the traditional way?? like do i have to spoon feed that fact to you also? gosh this is sad.

&gt;so you've given up on the idea that conservatism is the most adaptive? apparently, seeing as once again you refuse to explain why.

no i have not

&gt;however - to answer your question briefly (because i actually do know what i'm talking and can defend my position)

bro, you posted an article claiming ayn rand is a conservative, and when proven wrong. you doubled down and lied. so please calm down with the narcissism.

&gt;classic conservatism is literally the desire to conserve how things are now at its' heart. preserve the existing social structure. preserve the existing moral code.

no? you are literally this stupid, like do you think that people who lived in the last stages of the death of the ussr and wanted to preserve communism were conservative???? because according to your words **\"classic conservatism is literally the desire to conserve how things are now at its' heart.\"**

in this case literally anyone is conservative no matter what their ideology is.

like please answer if you think classical conservatism is about **\"the desire to conserve how things are now at its' heart.\"** is a communist in the late stages of the ussr who wants to conserve the socialist state, a conservative?

see how stupid your definition is

&gt;it's literally a resistance to change. so by it's very nature it does less well adapting to new conditions and new situations. as a model it's designed specifically to not adapt to change.

yes by your definition, conservatism is a brain dead ideology that means nothing. so i'm not surprised you believe this.",conservatives

&gt; sigh...

talking to the mirror again?

&gt;rand wasn't quoted in the article at all, so right off the bat you felt the need to lie to try to make your point.

sorry - you're right i should have been more specific and said she wasn't quoted saying she wasn't conservative or she was a libertarian. and nethier of those quotes are of her saying that at all. 

i get you thought you had a \"matlock moment\" there - but swing and a miss again :)

&gt;and in fact the article didn't say she wasn't conservative

the article does not. you circle the headline - and then the article below it goes on to say she was a conservative!!!! it's right below what you scribbled. 

utter fail there - but thanks for posting it :)

&gt;nor did it say she was a libertarian as you claimed.

and it doesn't. it pointed out that one element of what she believed was more often associated with liberals **or** libertarianism. it made zero claim that she was a liberal or libertarian. at all. 

and i did explain this to you. a conservative person can still agree with something that isn't \"traditionally\" conservative thinking and still be conservative.  utter fail there. 

i take it english is your second language.? lolol

so i'll give you partial points on the first one, it's pretty obvious from the context i said it in that i meant she wasn't quoted identifying as a libertarian. and nobody else actually calls her one, so it's a complete and utter fail on the last two. 

and what you've demonstrated is that your comprehension skills are weak. which does explain why you're wrong so often, 

oh - and sorry yes i meant to type socialsts instead of capitalists. the answer's just as true tho :)",liberals

statistically, guns are bad for self-defence. you’re more likely to hurt yourself or someone you live with than an attacker.

the us also has those idiotic “stand your ground” laws that allow people to simply say they feel threatened and that makes it self-defence. that inflates their numbers a bit. and many of the other cases are against other people with guns. almost as if people are trying to use guns to solve the problems made by guns.

and as far as taxes go, for the most part they were used to provide needed and beneficial services. sure you paid tax, but you got healthcare. sure there was  tax on gas, but the roads got maintained and improved. all of that means a better quality of life and more capacity for business. 

what we're seeing now is different. there has already been a quiet softening of incomes. and covid has played hell with our economic situation. which normally would mean a reduction of inflation. but - instead we have inflation far exceeding growth in wages or income. we have taxes that contribute nothing at all to the services we need and which unfairly target the most vulnerable.  and it has grown out of control.  on top of it, we have borrowed more money in the last few years than we did in the entire 150 years before that, which puts serious strains on our gov'ts ability to deliver services moving forward. 

so no - it's not the same. and justin has much responsibility for the situation. he did not invent covid, and that's the truth. nor is he responsible for the supply chain side of things.  well - not entirely for sure. 

but - he is responsible for spending 100 billion before covid showed up unnecessarily during a relatively strong economic period which he inherited. that is debt we really did not need, and it would sure be nice to have 100 billion extra kicking around now. 

he is responsible for dumping hundreds of billions more in unearned dollars into the economy than was necessary to get us through covid, and that has a devastating effect .  it means our debt level is so high we will be unable to respond to the next crisis properly. it means we'll need to raise taxes etc just to provide the same level of services we have now (or less). and yes - it does drive up inflation badly. and it weakens our businesses ability to recover. 

when you throw on top a large carbon tax that contributes nothing to the economy and makes the costs of basic items like food and heat far more expensive...  well. you get what we have now. and it's getting harder for people to get by.

this is not 'normal', nor is it sustainable, and it will lead to very bad times for a lot of people. because what comes after this is a crash. just like the 80's.",liberals

well yeah, there’s a reason why many parents put their children into the private caregivers - everything from capacity to price.

that’s also the point of these child care deals. to not only lower the price of child care (which would be lower than these private caregiver), but to also create a higher capacity. over time, this should see far more children in these ‘public’ child care spaces and should see more and more families reaping the benefits.

of course, expansion will take time, but that’s also not an argument against the child care deals - if anything, that’s an argument for why they need to be implemented asap in order to ensure that more families reap the benefits sooner rather than later.

a program like this is pretty transformational, of course it’s going to take time to increase the amount of licensed capacity. until now what has been the motivation to do so? if they know the gov’t is going to be bankrolling them directly going forward i’d say that’s a pretty good incentive for people to fill out the paperwork. 

i am a statistic; in sask using unlicensed daycare and still think this program is going to be a massive success in the long run, even if my kid ages out of daycare before it happens. 

our daycare, fwiw, sent us a text as soon as this program was announced and said they were looking into the licensing process. they understand that from a business perspective why would people continue to use them if they could get a subsidized space elsewhere. 

author seems too focused on the political bullshit and not what it’s actually going to mean for families who are currently using it. even by his “only 2/10 in sask” metric, thats still 20% of families using daycare in sask who will see an immediate cash injection. that’s bad, why?

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;blanchet said wednesday that \"questions arise\" due to the minister's former role as head of the canadian arab federation. blanchet also said he \"refuses to accuse\" the minister of anything specific.

that i will admit seems pretty vague on the surface. why should questions arise because the minister was head of the canadian arab federation? well [they are a activist organization formed to represent the interests of  arab canadians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_arab_federation). on the surface that seems pretty simplistic. lots of various ethnic groups have their own advocacy organizations. however, the stances the canadian arab  federation have taken are disturbing.  they have said in the past that hezbollah and hamas are \"legitimate political parties resisting illegal occupation by israel\". not surprisingly, most of their controversial statements are centered around israel-related issues.

it doesn't look like they have any actual links to terrorism or anything like that. simply radical views.

my view: the bloc leader should have been specific. it's fair to ask questions, but they should be direct. i think this guy is unfit to be a minister because of his past associations. however, if you want to call out someone's professional history, state clearly why you are doing it, and why you object to it. tell the people what questions  arise because of his past rather then leaving it up in the air and refusing to be specific.",liberals

her move to the liberals, and willingness to shift her position, suggests to me that she could have been dealt with within the green party, if other party members (basically, paul and zatzman) had been willing to have mature discussions with her about her position. clearly she was at least willing to have reasonable discussion about her position, if they hadn't nuked her on twitter and then mistreated her privately. the issue was evidently not a hill she wanted to die on, so the fact she crossed the floor over it really highlights how poor the leadership was from paul and how much things were mismanaged",liberals

h66cgfz,2021-07-22T07:34:26.000-07:00,"a housing crisis is costing canadians billions. what are politicians going to do about it? the problem with housing and electoral politics is that even though housing has become nothing more than a pipe dream for a lot of people, a majority of canadians are still homeowners, and make up a majority of the voting base. i think trudeau knows this and knows that elections are won and lost in the suburbs, especially suburban toronto, where many people own their homes. if you threaten the price of their home with housing policy that increases supply or limits demand, they will turn against you and you will lose the election as a result.

the fact of the matter is that a market-based approach will not work until that market is regulated like a housing market. foreign ownership should be severely limited, if not outright banned, and there needs to be limitations on how rental companies can operate. a lot of housing in cities is swept up by rental companies, and the recent story about a toronto-based rental agency scooping up $1b in new housing was so notable because they can just do that and no one can stop them.

lewis was my favourite. she seemed to be the most passionate and hungry for the position. she presented a lot of common sense arguments and agreeable views minus the red herring which was her stance on abortion. personally i have no horse in that race so my opinion on that is moot. but that would have been an immediate deal breaker for the general public. 

her performance at the debates was catastrophic. she treated it like a court case where as mackay and o'toole spoke like politicians. both her and derek sloan kind of showed their nervous twitches when the cameras were pointed at them. she also attacked o'tooles stance on canzuk which to quite a few conservatives and even some center left i know, see as a good idea. 

she needs a least a term in the commons as an mp. she needs to learn the ropes and work on her french. i have a feeling that some of her stances were almost in exchange for support as she truly was the underdog and was looking to get support from wherever it came from. the fact she made it that far to be in the final four is a testament to her drive in itself.

i live in coq-poco and it's a close race. i've seen a few ppc signs on lawns, so i wouldn't be surprised if they siphon some conservative votes. the ndp are also up but the liberal is the incumbent. oh and there's no green candidate. it's at least a 3 way race, if not an ndp-con challenge (like next door port moody-coquitlam).

they actually lean left on social policy for the most part.

they however defend vociferously the part of the constitution related to provincial power and jurisdiction. 

so whatever the provincial government (currently caq) does the bq will support it because that's quebec's decision (legislatively)

the leader of the caq backed the cpc because he thinks a minority cpc with bq to protect qc is a better outcome for qc. 

the bq have no allegiance to the big tent parties 

if it's good for quebec they support. if it's bad for quebec they don't. 

that's the extent of their big tent party allegiance. 

generally speaking, outside of cash to quebec and leaving quebec's jurisdiction alone, \"what's good for quebec\" is whatever is broadly in line with their federal platform which outlines what the bq supports in terms of federal jurisdiction. 

which as i said, is broadly left leaning since they are largely supportive of socialism type projects related to universal benefits and helping rural communities and lower income people through some form of wealth distribution rather than personal responsibility bootstraps issues.

in terms of the non economic social policies they're right leaning. quebec is a majority catholic province and while they like to claim secularism etc, there are still heavily socon views in quebec and historically those were bloc issues along with the issue of sovereignty as the pcs were not where socon voters out their votes and the socon streak has always been weaker than the economic socialist streak also. this helps to explain how the ndp became the federalist vote in 2011 because they were more in line than the cpc, and the bq was weak, and the liberals were in the middle of a total collapse.

it's also why we don't see the ndp come back in quebec. the federalists are happy with the lpc again, the cpc aren't strong enough there, and the bq becomes the default protect quebec from the english who don't understand us vote.",liberals

hbw9wga,2021-09-06T14:53:20.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - tuesday, september 7, 2021 i don't usually like giving my view on political positions (except for a few things like electoral reform in particular), i usually try to be as non partisan as possible and just enjoy numbers, strategy and projections related to elections. but this one is something that frustrates me. 

so here are my thoughts on gun legislation in canada:

it's broken and isn't effective... at all

[snippet from a review on the effectiveness of legislation in canada](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555647/), canada specific, on gun legislation:
&gt;no beneficial association was found between legislation and female or male homicide rates. there was no association found with firearm prevalence rates per province and provincial suicide rates, but an increased association with suicide rates was found with rates of low income, increased unemployment, and the percentage of aboriginals in the population. in conclusion, firearms legislation had no associated beneficial effect on overall suicide and homicide rates. prevalence of firearms ownership was not associated with suicide rates. 

canada is not the states.

our level of gun violence and mass shootings is nowhere near that of the states. that being said, our proximity to the states and our consumption of american media makes guns scary to many average canadians. news pieces about gun violence in the states warp our perception about the state of affairs in our own country, and we jump to the conclusion that more legislation is required. all the while the legislation we have is completely broken. 

[airguns (bb guns, essentially toys) are facing stricter regulation](https://globalnews.ca/news/7656030/canadian-airgun-enthusiasts-federal-gun-bill/)

[but i can buy a crossbow no questions asked, even if i have a criminal background](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/crossbows-regulated-1.3738588)

firearms owners are the minority here, and voters who have nothing to lose by it will happily sacrifice the ownership rights of others for a false sense of security. this is a modern day example of gratuitously legislating the behavior of the minority because of the ignorance and fear of the majority. a fear systematically and deliberately instilled for political purposes to villainize opponents and scaring voters to support you.  

it has become a big deal because fear is effective politically, and by scaring voters into thinking the other guy is allowing something bad to happen, people will vote for you. 

i'm not sure how this will affect o'toole. i'm not sure how many single issue voters there were trying to escape gratuitous and ignorant lpc legislation, but to me it really is a shame that this is getting so much attention when there's a lot of other far more important issues.

regardless on how you feel about guns, this should not be as big of a topic as it is. this is a classic case of 'culture of fear' political strategy and i think that this really is one topic that left leaning canadian voters should reflect their position on (specifically on current legislation).

gun legislation here is completely broken. and this is a perfect example of tyranny of the majority.

*full disclosure: i do not own any firearms, i am not in the processes of obtaining firearms, and i have no intent to own any firearms in the future. i am just someone who considers themselves to be a rational person and recognizes that gun legislation has effectively become a political weapon",conservatives

you've not argued how this is the case, you've just made vague platitudes about \"rich people bad\". how is a large amount of close to expiration date meat or old bread being thrown out by costco or walmart going to help hungry people in yemen or congo? a huge amount of wasted food in north america simply isn't logistically capable of being transported around the world to where it is actually needed.

not to mention that in many places with food insecurity, you'd face resistance from local farmers. if some foreigners just came in and handed out free food to anyone who wanted it, that's destroying their entire way of life as someone who grows food.

it all depends on what your metric is: most votes, most seats, or closest to forming government. they're all related, but not exactly the same thing. i do think a conservative path to victory entails shedding some support in the west -- this means losing votes and seats (but not collapsing) -- so long as that political capital buys seats in the east. honestly, a pretty good result looks like getting about as many seats, but shifting some of them further east. 

at the end of the day it's very simple: if you can't keep the western rural ridings placated while trying to win over the eastern suburban ridings then the conservative party as it is currently constituted has no future.",conservatives

today we canadians are part of a maturing society. racial discrimination is not only frowned upon, but it's also illegal. we have become a society that values the differences between the different peoples within our society. but if one would demand to live outside of our society, one must expect to find obstruction and friction.

the natives chose, in the beginning, to live outside the dominant society. at the time, that must have had some value. today however...it is completely counter productive. society no longer shuns the native people, but is welcoming.

hptuguk,2021-12-24T01:34:30.000-08:00,"liberals put 6-month pause on efforts to lower cost of patented medicines you know liberalism means many different things in many different places right? for someone supposedly in academia, you sure have a narrow view of a centuries old political ideology.

the lpc is a social liberal party, which makes it a left wing political group. if it was an economic liberal party, it would skew towards the right, but considering the amount of money this government spends, i think we can cross that off the list.",liberals

my point isn’t that liberals can’t be left wing, it’s that the word liberal is used synonymously with left wing when it shouldn’t be.

as for the lpc, their constant propping up of business, lassiez-faire attitude toward housing and refusal to implement basic promises like pharmacare out of “respect” for industry certainly troubles your analysis that spending money = left wing.",liberals

gmokqbf,2021-02-08T17:44:17.000-08:00,"canadians split in believing trudeau on vaccinations by september: nanos​ survey i don't see how it's much in the gov's control and the factors that do put it in their control are already in place. 

for example, yes it sucks that we don't have domestic vaccine production capabilities and we have to rely on foreign countries and foreign companies to produce them. 

but the fate of vaccines is on companies like moderna and pfizer. they have contracts with the feds and will need to fulfil those. if they don't then the opposition parties will be playing heavy politics. 


if they do, it'll be election time since the gov will probably have over delivered on their promise.",liberals
