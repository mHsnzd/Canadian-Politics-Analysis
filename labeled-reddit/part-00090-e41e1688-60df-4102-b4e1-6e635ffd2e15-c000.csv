you are 100% incorrect in this assertion.  we are 100% in control of who comes into canada, just as they are 100% in control of who enters the us.  what schumer and the border politicians are complaining about is that we still have restrictions on canadians taking day trips to the us, even when fully vaccinated.  to a lesser extent they care about americans being able to come to canada.

&gt; the process that created the ministry of state for urban affairs was long and one that trudeau did not embark upon easily. his resolve was tested and with it, his vision of federalism was contested. canada’s political reality clashed with his theoretical conceptualization of its federation. while trudeau’s early writings suggest that he believed in a compartmentalized view of canadian federalism, he did acknowledge that change was needed over time for the federation to survive. trudeau argues that “the compromise of federalism is generally reached under a very particular set of circumstances. as time goes by these circumstances change... to meet these changes, the terms of the federative pact must be altered” (the essential trudeau 121). trudeau quite possibly believed that canada’s sustained urbanization required a unique policy response. he changed the pact, but not after sustained opposition to engaging canada’s urban centres.

&gt; trudeau’s concession marked the initiation of formal federal–local relations in canada. msua engaged municipalities like no other federal department before it, filling a policy vacuum and marking a shift in how canadians viewed their urban space. with these two factors juxtaposed, the creation of msua can be seen as a shift in our national thinking on both federalism and urbanism.",liberals

[timeline of the covid-19 pandemic in canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_covid-19_pandemic_in_canada)

&gt;on january 23... dr. theresa tam was a member of the who committee that broadcast that it was too early to declare a public health emergency of international concern. 

[in china, transport in wuhan, huanggang and ezhou severely restricted, including closure of public transit, trains, airports, and major highways.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covid-19_lockdown_in_china) [on january 24, travel restrictions enacted in 12 additional prefecture-level cities in hubei.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/covid-19_lockdown_in_china)

&gt;on january 25, the first identified presumptive case in canada was a male in his 50s who travelled between wuhan and guangzhou before returning to toronto on january 22. canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to china due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of hubei. **federal health officials stated that the risk in canada was low.**

&gt;**on january 26, tam stated \"there is no clear evidence that this virus is spread easily from person to person. the risk to canadians remains low.\"** final testing conducted at the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg, manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on january 27. on january 27, canada confirmed its first case.

amazing risk assessment from the supposed best canada has to offer.

&gt;on january 29, the health committee of parliament holds a meeting on the canadian response to the outbreak of coronavirus. liberal mp marcus powlowski, a doctor, asks theresa tam since the chinese health authorities led by xiaowei ma were saying that covid-19 was being spread by asymptomatic patients (as reported in the new york times), canada should require travelers from china to quarantine for 14 days. **tam suggested that at that point, quarantining was not thought to be necessary.**

china has been **severe restrictions** for five days yet our health minister thinks that quarantines are not necessary. perhaps the chinese know something we don't with this potentially lethal virus?

&gt;on january 30, the who declared the coronavirus was a \"**public health emergency of international concern**\".

[on january 31, the trump administration, through the u.s. department of health and human services, declared a public health emergency, and imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for any u.s. citizens who has visited hubei province in china within the preceding two weeks. it also began denying entry of non-u.s. nationals who had traveled to china within the preceding two weeks. this was the first such travel restriction by the u.s. in more than 50 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_covid-19_pandemic_in_the_united_states_(2020)

&gt;on february 1, the government's position remained that **it would be discriminatory to exclude travelers from china, the politico-geographical source of the disease.** 

**meanwhile, [australia's decides to close the country to all traffic from mainland china.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/timeline_of_the_covid-19_pandemic_in_canada)** note that we now have 16x the deaths per capita.

&gt;on february 26, minister of health patty hajdu recommended that citizens stockpile food and medication, noting that it was \"good to be prepared because things can change quickly [in any emergency].\"

canadians should apparently be stockpiling food and medication, yet still **nothing** has been done at the border.

&gt;**on march 4, 2020**, trudeau announced his creation of the cabinet committee on the federal response to the coronavirus disease, chaired by chrystia freeland, \"to limit the spread of the virus\" and to protect \"the health and safety of all canadians\".

&gt;on march 11, the world health organization declared the virus to be the cause of a worldwide covid-19 pandemic.

&gt;on march 13, trudeau announced that the federal government was preparing a stimulus package to address those affected by the pandemic. parliament agrees unanimously to shut its doors for five weeks (pursuant to standing order 28) because of covid-19.

&gt;on march 16, trudeau announced that new entry restrictions would be implemented shortly after midnight et on march 18, restricting entry into the country to americans and canadian citizens and permanent residents and their families and flight crew members who are not displaying symptoms of covid-19. all people arriving were asked to **self-isolate for 14 days**. most international flights were routed to canada's an arbitrary selection of four airports (yvr, yyc, yyz, and yul) in order \"to enhance screening measures\". minister of foreign affairs françois-philippe champagne also announced that for citizens who are still abroad, the country would provide emergency loans of up to $5,000 to cover travel costs or basic needs until they are able to return. the border closure led to a million canadians returning home over the next week. passengers from east asian countries wore masks on their flights, but those arriving from europe did not. **masks were not even recommended.** there were no temperature checks. people were packed in close at airport waiting areas. hand sanitizer dispensers had not been installed. not everyone received the pamphlets instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days.

&gt;on march 18, donald trump and justin trudeau announced that the canada-u.s. border would close to non-essential travel. people entering canada would be asked to self-isolate for 14 days. family of canadian citizens, students and foreign workers with visas would be allowed to enter. truckers and flight crews carrying essential goods did not need to self-isolate.

this is what we get. march 18th, **55 days after china locks down a province of almost 60m people**, **46 days** after the us and australia close their borders to china (which was at least **something**), an act that our government considered too \"discriminatory\", we finally close our borders to noncitizens (unless you are family of canadian citizens, students and foreign workers with visas, which is a lot of exceptions), and tell people to \"pretty please self quarantine!\" when people enter our country. how this can be considered an adequate response to a pandemic, especially given the amount of uncertainty at the time this was playing out, is delusional. 

the only reason that this pandemic response is considered adequate, or even somehow good (???), is because the pathogen is not actually deadly enough to expose the failure of this government and their complete lack of response for over a month. it is not inconceivable to have a virus that actually kills people under 60 with a cfr of &gt;5% as opposed to the 0.14% we have with covid-19, with a higher r0 or slower incubation period. it is easier to stop disease at the border than internally, but this government considers that discrimination. it's not fair! they would rather their citizens equally dead or equally locked in their houses for 18 months than discriminate.

sure everybody wants the biggest house on the biggest piece of land, but at some point people have to make a compromise for what they can afford. lots of housing built after places to grow was a variety of denser freehold styles, not just condos. places to grow allowed for a mix of housing that was denser and still had the key features people like with detached. you say \"we haven't adapted\", but many people have and they are living in the new homes.",liberals

weirdly enough, trudeau jr seems to be going through these same issues. maybe he should look to his father's legacy and recreate the ministry of state for urban affairs.

in the likely scenario ontario will be generating more cash then they put into the program from it. debt to gdp ratios are important when discussing debt crises - rising gdp, a result of the program, reduces the debt to gdp ratio significantly. even in the case that the federal government for some reason pulled back expenditure, most of ontario’s expenditure would be recouped, and they would still have the benefits of the program.

literally every country in the world is running a massive deficit. it was not possible to avoid with covid. interest rates are at an all time low and when combined with inflation means that the debt can be far more easily payed off in the future. before the pandemic, canada’s debt to gdp ratio was actually decreasing for most of trudeau’s tenure. if they did not spend the money throughout the pandemic it’s likely our economy would have at least partially collapsed - millions unable to make rent has that effect. the rules around household balanced budgets do not apply to the budgets of sovereign nations, especially when they are among the most advanced economies in the world.

the most recent pbo report on debt suggests the federal government’s debt situation is sustainable (with the assumption that we go back to pre pandemic spending following the crisis). given that this is likely to happen, the childcare program will more then pay for itself, and the pbo is an entirely independent body, i am not worried about federal debt. the feds have no incentive to cut the program at all.",liberals

h8stv9p,2021-08-13T02:36:20.000-07:00,"ignore the crocodile tears over canada's deficit thank you for the respectful discussion.

i fully agree that over the past 25 years left wing parties have been  better on economics. however, i think there's a couple things to keep in mind. the first is that we've been in a low inflationary environment with below full employment. that's happened globally. in that situation greater spending is going to be the wiser choice. meanwhile, if you look at the 1970-95 era we were in a high inflationary environment. in that situation increased spending will simply drive up inflation without boosting the economy. in my view that's why thatcher and reagan were able to be relatively successful (in their time!). the total failure of conservatism was that they didn't realize that circumstances had changed once inflation had been tamed. i think there's the *potential* for that to be happening to the left currently. they've been right on the merits for 25 years. what they naturally want to do, spend more, was the objectively correct decision. my worry is there's a failure to reckon that if inflation is back that totally changes the circumstances.

the second factor is you have a \"only nixon could go to china\" effect. if you look at the cold war era right-wing presidents sure seemed to do a better job at improving relations with the eastern bloc. nixon recognizing the prc. reagan deescalating with gorbachov. meanwhile carter saw the end of detente and the soviet invasion of afghanistan. in my view that had nothing to do with more competence on the side of the right-wing. it was that if the left tried to deescalate the right would savage them for it. that's why they say \"only nixon could go to china\". his anti-communist credentials were so without question no one could question him from the right for the choice he made. in my view something similar occurs with economics. the right wing can't cut spending and get budgets in line without being savaged by the left for cruelty. left wing governments don't have that issue and have more freedom of movement. in my view that's a lot that explains why the liberals were able to make necessary cuts in the 1990s when mulroney couldn't.

anyway, my overarching point is that the left has been right on economics ever since inflation has been tamed. but i worry they've taken the wrong lesson. it's not that they're always right, it's that in the specific circumstances what they advocated for was the correct decision. those circumstances *may* be changing. i'm not saying they are, and i would fully support trying to push deficit spending as far as we can until inflation cuts in. the concern is that there isn't a realization that when inflation cuts in the correct policy changes. so that's what i mean by arrogance, it's the tone of \"our views are always correct\" instead of \"in the specific circumstances are views our correct but these factors could change that\".",liberals

sure there's always risks until we're done with the pandemic entirely, but the risks are mostly for the unvaccinated &amp; there's plenty of alternative ways to have their voice heard without putting them at risk, and when it comes to vaccinated people voting the risk is lower for outbreak there than the return of schools which will be happening at the same time as the election.",liberals

there’s no doubt in my mind that the federal government anticipated this challenge. as you noted earlier, there were a number of constitutionally sound options available to the federal government, but here we are. my guess is that trudeau was reluctant to override existing provincial emission control regimes (namely ontario’s), which ended up being a short-sighted concern.

jagged edges there, being compared to scheer. we can debate who had a better chance, but the comparison isn't a good sign for o'toole.

sure maybe some mps who are favour of restricting abortion can win in some social conservative ridings. but a conservative party running on a platform of restricting abortion would never be able to win enough social liberal ridings around the gta and other urban areas to form government. that’s the reality. it’s a position pretty far to the right for most canadians.",conservatives

which is not the same not opposing abortion.   **i** think our current abortion laws are acceptable.   i also oppose some abortions based on the stage of fetal development and sex selective ones which are expressions of misogyny.

am i a social conservative?   well, i'm a christian with moral views that can easily be described as \"traditional\".   and as i said earlier, i think our current abortion laws are acceptable and on the subject of gay rights, (i.e. marriage etc.) i'm very much in favour of equal rights.   this isn't at all strange for someone who doesn't think all immoral things should be illegal.  i also think cheating on your wife is immoral, but i wouldn't make it illegal because of the problems that would cause.   legislating some morality makes sense, (see laws against child pornography), while legislating other morality does not make sense.

going back to abortion, i strongly oppose sex selective abortion because i oppose misogyny and sex selective abortion is almost invariably coming from misogyny and it is an expression of misogyny.     so i'm intrigued by ideas to reduce sex selective abortion without altering abortion rights.    does that make me a \"social conservative\" on abortion?   well, it's hard to argue that opposing abortion isn't in some way socially conservative while at the same time it's pretty ridiculous to say that opposing altering abortion rights is socially conservative.   

the answer is of course that the ideas of a great many canadians simply don't fit tidy categories.   where i show up in that poll depends on the very precise question you ask.",conservatives

you're probably quite right, but that's not a small hill either. conservative movements - not just in canada - have been villifying anything that looks like an enviromental policy for too long. the last leading canadian conservatives i can recall talking about it seriously were mulroney and manning.

manning has been saying for the last couple of years that a carbon tax is a dead end for the cpc, just as a matter of pragmatic politics. and while that is by no means the only possible environmental policy, i think there is some bleed-over. many of the arguments bolstered have not been of the \"carbon tax is not right, here's our plan\", but more attacking the underlying assumption that something should be done on the environmental front. whether because it's economically unfeasible, not a real thing, we'll tech our way out of it or what have you. the target may have been the tax, but a lot the arguments targetted climate change writ large.

when you go doorknocking the feedback you get is logged. parties can track what % of previous voters, that they can reach, are planning on voting again for the party.  they're doing that in every neighborhood, street by street, block by block.

that's just one example of data that is much more powerful than any given national phone survey. parties have a lot more data than that.

public surveys are just advertising for polling companies. it's treated as such. internal polling is the lifeblood of any political party. it's treated as such.

many people have thousands of dollars in guns that were turned into something worth less than paper weights. that value was \"stolen\" from them, and don't kid yourself into believing that they will get anything more than a small fraction of the amount of money they spent on their guns.

no amount of tax credit or social programs will be of greater financial benefit to them than having the ability to use and/or sell their firearms at market value again.

further, if you are actually worried about affordability, and those social, economic and environmental programs you should want the government to not waste nearly a billion dollars buying guns that were banned solely for political reasons and serve no actual public safety purpose. rather invest that billion into climate action, housing, health etc.

taking that billion and further subsidizing electric cars will do far greater good for canadians and the planet than buying guns that are simply not used in crimes in this country.",liberals

i'd guess we're somewhere abour 1 actual point, maybe 2 above the libs in practical terms. they're probably at around 32 and we're probably around about a 33.5 - 34.   that would mean the cpc picked up 6 points in just two weeks and that's nothing short of amazing. but it's obviously very real, and it feels like there's still upward pressure even if there's not much change in intention. that strongly suggests that they still have room to grow.

but in most elections you see growth and momentum, and then a pause. then either renewed growth or a drop. nobody goes straight up for 5 weeks.  the question is can o'toole pick that momentum back up and pick up that extra 3 points outside of alberta that he needs to get a strong win. or better yet the 4 or 5 he'd need for a weak majority. 

another little fact - the party that goes into the last 3 days with momentum tends to pick up another 2 or 3 points in the actual results. 

so - if o'tool can solidify his gains now, keep that pressure up, maybe pick up another half point or point in real terms, and then have a strong showing in the debate - that debate may be the catalyst that pushes him into his second growth spurt and brings home a solid win. if he doesn't wow in the debates or if for some other reason the libs manage to get a little momentum back then he might have to live with a reduced minority.  which is perfectly fine if it's reduced enough.",conservatives

singh doesn't have that approach. he uses a divisive approach of choosing popular scapegoats who own relatively few votes (corporations, the rich, oil companies, etc), and blaming them for various problems their voter base has.

actually solving problems in leadership requires working with those groups. if you want to boost jobs for your classic ndp worker base, you need to work with corporations, because that's who hires people. notley achieved strong environmental gains by working with the oil industry.

they used to be, and to some extent still are supposed to be, a catch-up party of nationalists and sovereignists from across the province, regardless of whether they are left or right.

the true is that the bq vote would likely go in numerous directions, were it disappear. i suspect it would be liberal, tory, and maybe even some ndp too, after all in 2011 when the bloc &amp; liberal vote collapsed, the ndp took seats across the province largely with bq support.

a lot of bq vote in les régions and in and around québec city would likely go more tory, with the banlieues of montréal going more liberal.

this will just create a litigation mess we see down south across the border where different town, districts and states have a honeycomb of laws surrounding one classification of firearm. great plan and objective liberal party! create as much confusion as possible *you created* but some how angle it that it's a sign more idiotic policy is needed of which isn't directed at crime and smuggling.

polysesouvient will not be happy until everything is banned. we live an a country with a huge sporting and hunting heritage. canada reported that approximately 22 percent of all households owned at least one firearm and this is a 2015 statistic. $8.5 billion on spending on hunting and sporting shooting in canada each year. over 20 million(estimate) guns owned by individuals for protection, hunting, recreation, competition, collecting, predator control, and other uses.

these anti-gun groups and liberals would have you think it's lawless somalia in the streets. we have an estimated 2,219,371 rpal/pal registered and the numbers are increasing. this argument is strawmaned by polysesouvient and the liberals/ndp at nauseum. they act like these statistics aren't available. you want to register out of the  20 million guns that aren't restricted (long gun classification) lmao you have 20 years and more billions to spend on the sheer amount of time to do that. they even have the gaul to say firearms should be stored at a facility. where do we find the infrastructure and security resources to handle that? maybe they can just stay where they belong at the residence of the registered individual, where they sit locked safely and are the responsibility of the owner.

another laughable part to this bill is the liberals and blair have put airsoft and paintball on their hit list. a game played by all peoples ages 12-50. can't look to how japan and england regulated the sport. nope that would take time - just ban it period end of discussion. japan has literally 0 tolerance for firearm ownership and england where it's very restrictive, yet the sport/game of airsoft and paintball thrive.

***“technically, a handgun is a restricted weapon. it should be very hard to get license to have one, but with the black market, with the access, with the internet you can buy and sell weapons.”***

well. in canada it is harder.... with a secondary class required. purchases and transfers require the cfo/rcmp to clear. rpal/pal owners have their records checked everyday though computer scans.

***“our neighbouring countries, just outside the border, which is a very permeable border,” he explained. “there are more guns than people. guns are criss-crossing the border all the time.”***

we know where these issues are: grand river, beauharnois-salaberry regional county municipality, alaska border. so much money could actually be invested into gang/drug/smuggling units and border security. nope spend near billion during a pandemic on buybacks and federal strong arming a vetted citizen class.

until then i will continue to be of the belief that if someone walks like a liberal and talks like a liberal, that person is probably a liberal. and if that person in walking and talking like a liberal is incapable of envisioning anything other than an insufficient market-based approach to solving the climate crisis, i don't think it's unfair for me to conclude that through the actions of self-professed liberals that 'liberalism' as a political philosophy is incapable of grasping the climate crisis as a symptom of capitalism that requires a dismantling of the economic system to solve.

h8f4es2,2021-08-10T01:25:14.000-07:00,"federal program spending on housing affordability in 2021 - pbo the liberals market their housing programs as a \"$70b housing plan\", but the pbo pours some cold water on that here:

&gt;the national housing strategy is marketed as a “$70+billion plan.”in total, cmhc plans to spend $36.7 billion over the 10 years of the national housing strategy from 2018-19 to 2027-28, of which $24.4 billion is new spending announced in the 2017 national housing strategy or subsequent budget 
documents and $12.3 billion is pre-existing spending. as noted above, this represents a $12.2 billion increase relative to the 10-year baseline.

at the end of the day, the trudeau government has increased spending on housing affordability by about $1.2b annually. this is a paltry sum compared to spending on homeownership subsidies. for example, the capital gains exemption on primary residences alone runs over $7b per year.

moreover, the pbo reveals the incredible fact that much of the funding had gone unspent! of the national housing co-investment fund and rental construction financing initiative, less than half of the promised dollars were spent.

the gap between government rhetoric and policy reality on the housing file is simply unfathomable. i've never seen anything like it. both opposition and the media need to start taking a more critical look at the government's claims here. the pbo itself seems to be practically begging them to do so.",liberals

it is true that large quantities of fertilizer are regulated, but i can still walk into a home depot and get enough ammonium nitrate, stump remover, and other items to make enough nitro cellulose to level an entire city block, all without ever showing id or ending up on a registered list. why is it that we do not have a oklaholma type attack yearly? why is it that with over 3.4 million gun owners in canada aren't mass shootings happening more often? the answer is simple, we do not have a mass shooting problem. we have a couple examples of mentally unstable individuals falling through the cracks. 

as for your statement that one of the shooters was being treated, that just reinforces the fact that we need competant mental health in this country. any of us can go into a walk in clinic and receive meds for mental issues, but that is only a bandaid. we need a system that allows access to therapists and counselors who are trained to identify, diffuse, and treat those at risk individuals.

why would anyone even expect them to? they would need to develop the expertise. they would need all the data from the province to judge if the money is well spent or not. then if they judge the money is not well spent, they have to fight the province to make it do what ottawa wants instead.

and in any case, it would make the whole system much more expensive and much slower. look at any interview the liberals mps give (at least in quebec), it’s the same damned thing since last march :

interviewer: isn’t your government ridiculously slow at doing anything at all?   
mp: well, you have to account for the fact that we have to find solutions that work for all of canada!

why would we want more of that?

yes. beastiality happens all the time. but the media is not focused on unearthing and sensationalizing numerous cases of beastiality as it is with racism.

what the media chooses to cover has a tremendous impact on public discourse and politics. right now the canadian media is following the lead of the american media in hyping up racial grievances. but this is canada, where the overwhelming majority of the populace agrees that racism is bad and should be stomped out.

actually the fundamentalist/ultra-orthodox edges of judaism tend to be rabidly anti-zionist. you'd have to go and ask the hasidic community themselves but their preferred policy is probably less \"move the capital of israel to jerusalem\" and more \"the state of israel should be dismantled.\"

in the american context, pro-israel policy is less trying to garner the votes of jewish people (who tend to have lukewarm feelings about israel at best) but rather trying to garner the support of evangelical christians who believe the state of israel existing and having it's capitol in jerusalem is one of the necessary preconditions for the apocalypse/second coming. 
 
&gt;can anyone explain why o'toole thinks this is important to the average canadian that we create controversy in israel?

this is where i'm less sure. while there is quite a bit of cross-pollination between american and canadian evangelicals, both theologically and politically, they have nowhere *near* the political influence they do as a bloc in the us. my best guess is that due to the political cross-pollination between american and canadian conservatives, moving the capitol of israel to jerusalem (and also generally adopting an unquestioningly pro-israel foreign policy) is just viewed as \"conservative policy\" in the same way that tax cuts and deregulation are viewed as \"conservative policy\".

\"fairly\" is a subjective term. number of people with an opinion isn't the only viable metric. you can also consider how strongly those people hold said opinion, or the degree to which someone is impacted by a decision.

she told people to vote for the olp.... i actually remember that election way back 3 years ago. people we're just tilted that she didn't outright endorse horwath and accept her party being wiped off the map.

the bc liberals exist, but my point was about the greens. they split the ndp's vote more often than not, but yet the ndp still won.

the ab liberals were much more of a force than the ab ndp were until notley entered the picture.

the mb liberals still exist too and cost the ndp on the margins.

look, fundamentally the ondp can whine about the unfairness of it all, or they can get their shit together and be in it to win it. they can organize and prepare and recruit good candidates and actually run a platform ontario may vote for. 

or they can lose to ford again because they haven't put in the work or built up the trust, and are mad the olp won't hand over their campaign machine.",liberals
