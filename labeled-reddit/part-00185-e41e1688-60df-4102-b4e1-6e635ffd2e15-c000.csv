gvfbv9j,2021-04-21T19:17:10.000-07:00,"analysis of racist anti-racism training carried out by the government of canada as a minority who grew up here ... let me first say that while i'm glad racism is under a more scrutinized light.... my god is critical race theory just terrible. conservatives at least in the past absolutely gave me a 'racist' vibe, especially if u were muslim in the 2000s, oh how crazy is it that the pendulum swung. 

implicit bias is real. racism does exist but everyone can be racist as it's just the act of implicit bias. from what i noticed at least in canada there are large groups that get a lot of funding from these practises and it's within their best interests to keep it going. which is ironic because it means the racial minorities without campaigning groups get nothing. just how ppl say racism can be systemic, there is a systemic reason why this type of agenda is being pushed. 

i do not think anyone will take retaliation against this seriously unless other minorities take a stance against this. if it's just a bunch of white conservatives no offense but the media will paint y'all as right wing extremists akin to trump supporters / anti maskers / etc (ironic). there's ppl out there that definately do call out cringe worthy things (oscars last year) but not only are our voices to small. but it's also not worth ruining ur reputation because other ppl may brand u as a racist. this type of shit will ruin ur professional career for instance.",conservatives

ho96i0e,2021-12-11T23:18:43.000-08:00,"opinion: canada’s rural-urban divide is getting deeper, and that hurts all canadians i can help answer that. to a lot of \"rural people\", trudeau is seen as only caring about urban populations and pandering to their votes. more specifically, he is sen as only caring about the gta, ottawa and quebec. there is a feeling of attack about rural way of life. i'll list just a few examples.

take firearms for example. for a greater percentage of the rural population than in cities, firearms are an integral component to their lifestyle. hunting and sport shooting activities are more common in rural areas. there is a large political game going on, and has been going on for a long time to buy votes in urban areas by going after legally owned firearms. it is a game because by design, it won't stop any problems or even accomplish what they claim yo accomplish. there will still be complete access to firearms for suicides (the number 1 fatality by firearm in canada). the proposed ban does nothing to stop the use and flow of illegal firearms (most firesrms used in a crime were never legal firearms in canada). there is still access to many semi auto rifles (less than half of mine were banned for example). they banned firearms by name, not function (some were banned, others with the same functionality were not). it is political, not practical. anyone who understands our firearms laws knows this. the general non firearms owner, does not and it would be easy to think that a ban may mean a safer community. this ban, does nothing except cost money and create division. 

now take the oil and gas sector. more so in alberta but the attitude is the same. there is an attack on the canadian oil and gas sectors due to valid enviromental concerns. the issues and division are amplified that we are shipping our own oil on the west coast to refineries in the u.s. and we are importing oil from countries with abysmal human rights and environmental records to refine the oil in our east coast refineries. canada has a real requirement for oil. people are upset that we should be giving those jobs to canadians, and extracting our oil under strong enviromental laws vs. how things sre done elsewhere, as we do our best to reduce the need for fossil fuels.

indeed, this is where you see the actual skills of a good manager in play (anyone can just crack a whip)

&gt; if you hit your goal, companies will just pile more work on to your plate

which is a mistake... eventually killing the golden goose

&gt;  if you're good at your job and go 100% with focus and effort, you're getting paid the same as someone giving 60-70%, while doing more and, in a lot of instances, picking up their slack. 

i see your point here but i disagree... an employee should not be into the business of comparing him/her-self with their peers... that's for a manager to do an address accordingly by balancing the load, rewarding the more efficient employee or getting rid of the bad employee for the benefit of everyone

btw, the companies that only reward your efficiency with more work are 100% the shitty companies everyone hates... walmart, amazon, banks, insurance sales, etc

&gt; in a salaried position, there is 0 incentive to work hard unless you want to move up within the company. this leads to people dicking around because there's no benefit to doing otherwise. just eventually hit your targets and keep it moving.

again, i disagree... if you maxed out in your current position move up.. if you maxed out in your current company, move up... this is obviously something that is very personal but i for once would dread to go to a job everyday and just dick around... to me, hell is a boring job.

i think you come from the perspective that people only work because they have to and mostly hate it... but not everyone is like that... i like my job, i used to love my previous one until management changed and ruined it... i switched and now i looove my new job... some people don't care much about the job but like the social aspect, or the benefit to the community or the discount they get in the company's merchandise...",liberals

the sad fact is that social conservatives are an enormous bloc of voters. even if the cpc did “kick them out,” it’s not like they’re just going to disappear. those votes are going somewhere. i don’t think you’d be too happy if they propped up some crackpot party like christian heritage or the people’s party. and you’d basically guarantee perpetual one party rule by the lpc until the end of time.

i’m going to suggest that political parties have very large, complex bases, and they should be judged by their leader and platform as opposed to the looniest people you can find associated with them. i hated stephen harper, but it’s only fair to recognize the fact that he intentionally kept that half of the party in check because he knew he couldn’t sell social conservatism in the rest of the country.

the leader and platform are all that matters. the recent cpc convention had them vote to not acknowledge climate change as a problem, yet o’toole has made having a credible climate plan a central part of his strategy anyways. the rabble don’t matter. always focus on the guy making the decisions.",conservatives

hozjes4,2021-12-17T07:58:10.000-08:00,"[deleted by user] &gt; you’re assuming motives you just can’t know, though. i keep saying that politics is slow and complicated, involving constant negotiation, compromise, and flexibility in plans. opposition parties have plans of their own they execute and you have to react, sometimes change your plans. sometimes you have to decide to spend political capital differently. sometimes something you thought would be doable turns out to be impossible for the moment, or not worth it if it impedes something bigger. people like to think they know what is going on, and the reasons pols do or don’t do things, but most of the time we just have no idea.

i find this response so strange. don't act like i'm naive just because i prefer honesty. i understand that politics is complicated...that doesn't mean it's acceptable to just lie and make promises that you can't keep.

everything you just said would be fine if trudeau campaigned on \"goals\" and \"aspirations\" but he made *promises*. it's incredibly naive and intellectually lazy to conclude that dishonesty from people in power is acceptable because \"politics is complicated\" and \"we common folk are too simple-minded to understand why lying is actually good\"",liberals

from there the biggest underlying issue is that it’s $300/week for zero hours of work. opposed to $600/week for 40 hours of work. many of the people that make minimum wage are seniors, students, and those than have spouses that support the family so they work to be out of the house.
