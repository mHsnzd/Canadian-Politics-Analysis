people want to think this was a public investment thing, when it wasn't just that by itself. there are a ton of vaccine candidates out there, many that are still waiting for approval. if there wasn't demand, a market to satisfy and profit to be made this would never happen.

and yes businesses operate for the sole purpose of making a profit, including during a pandemic.

but capitalism, profit and companies are always the bad guys according to people. they don't want to hear it and the patents must be waived out of the wazoo. this is the perfect situation for the middle ground, and i would prefer if the companies got out of it without getting screwed completely. it's not just a bunch of executives that were behind this. it was also scientists, project managers and financial analysts.

i would also like to see all these people be put in trudeau's shoes or any world leader in this situation for that matter. i would love to see just what they would do if they were in that position. it's very easy to criticize from the sidelines but completely different to be on the throne and have to face the myriad of interest groups against this as well as strong public opinion who wants it to happen. most of the people here making the case for it to \"be a simple decision\" have an iota of experience of what it is like to be put in that position.",liberals

the reason they're here is because they were allowed to come, and by the time we brought in weak travel controls it was far too late. there are failures at every level of government, but please don't use that statistic outside of its meaning and suggest travel isn't responsible for many cases; travel is responsible for 100% of cases at the end of the chain.",liberals

developers don't *want* to build huge condo towers with tons of space wasted on amenities. it's much more profitable to build medium density, but our cities make that kind of development prohibitively difficult and unprofitable. in many cases it is outright impossible to build medium density, and you will encounter major regulatory and legal costs for any level of densification, so you might as well just propose a 40+ story building and go directly to omb. (in the case of toronto.)

while the intentions of affordable housing advocates are good, the end result of this argument is to continue constraining the supply of new homes for canadians. we need to be pursuing every level of densification, everywhere. 4-8 unit buildings should be able to be built by right in every single neighborhood in toronto, vancouver and every other city. that's the only possible way to reduce some of the pressure on housing prices.

opposing development because it's not affordable enough makes everything more unaffordable for everyone. look to sf for an example of what this looks like. the city's housing stock is quite poor quality, and it is absurdly expensive. environmental and affordable housing advocates regularly oppose any new market-rate development. the end result is atrocious, and that is the situation towards which some of our largest cities are trending.",conservatives

h0ueae3,2021-06-06T08:24:37.000-07:00,"experts say trudeau‚Äôs acknowledgment of indigenous genocide could have legal impacts &gt;the big difference is that it is government planned, forced assimilation. 

no, it isn't. the first nations signed off on actually forcing the gov't to educate their children. and it was universal, not just them but everyone had to attend school. that's where we got truancy laws from. sorry if you didn't know that. 

&gt;that is part of what the chinese  
 government is doing to uighurs in xinjiang right now: they want them to  
 be absorbed into the han majority, via forced re-education (in addition  
 to things like forced sterilization).

sorry but no. if all they were doing is absorbing them into their culture we wouldn't call it genocide - its not a part of it. forced sterilizaiton - that absolutely is genocide behavior. so we all it genocide. well - most of us do, the libs don't of course. 

you can't just lump things together like that. you can't say \"that man jaywalked - and he just robbed a bank. therefore jaywalking is the same as robbing a bank\". 

&gt;the original intent of the residential schools was to eliminate the   
language and culture of native peoples.

not exactly. it was not to destroy it. there was no law forbidding the speaking of the languages in canada or the like.  had things gone as planned they would still have had their language and culture. i'm sure some would have been lost but for the most part not so much. as proof - i'll point out the schools operated for 130 years and the first nations langauge and culture hasn't been wiped out. and that's with the extra helping of brutal death rate and torture. 

&gt;both would meet the definition of genocide under article 6 of the rome statute of the international criminal court:

nope. sorry. it's pretty clear they did not intend to destroy that culture or people. they didn't relocate them, they didn't ban the speaking of the languages, they didn't do anything like that. the intent was to assimilate the kids and turn them into good little british subjects. that is not the same as trying to destroy the first nations. if they did - then they'd have sent everyone to reeducation camps and shut down the reserves. 

assimilation is not genocide. now - if they'd taken the children and shut down the reserves and dispersed the people and maybe made it illegal to speak their language or for them to asssociate - the kinds of things we see in china right now. .... maybe you'd have a point. but those reserves sill existed, the kids were free to go back to them with their new knowledge and in fact most did, it certainly wasn't illegal to be first nations,  none of the usual conditions were met. 

i was forced to take french classes in school. i was not offered my historic traditional language (either of them). so... is quebec guilty of genocide? '

&gt;in particular, residential schools would have fallen under section e.

no, that section refers to giving babies to other families to raise as their own children so they never have a connection to their original culture again. read your law man. if your definition was accurate every boarding school in europe would be a 'genocide'.  that is abso lutely not what that law refers to. it refers to the practice os some countries to round up the babies of a specific group and give them as an adoption to another family where they will be come permanent members of that family. the kids went home to their own families in this case (assuming they survived). and before they were even adults in most cases. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;ex post facto

there's nothing wrong with that as long as you don't attempt to apply the punishment for it. 

but it's not a genocide - not even close.  let me put it this way - if the malnutritiou and abuse hadn't happened and the kids had gone to the schools and gone home after grad like most other groups did - you'd  have never heard about 'residential schools'. nobody would be complaining today.",liberals

but it is true that he had no intention of being 'fiscally responsible' in the way that we normally look at it, at least not in the first 4 years or so. while his 'spending' was arguably much better than trudeau's, it was still 'borrow borrow borrow' for the near future without really having a plan to reel that in anytime soon. promising to get back to balance in 10 years without any milestones or targets between now and then doesn't mean much when political terms are only 4 years or less these days. 

i would have been more ok with it if he had done like harper and laid out a 5 year plan with deficit reduction targets for each year, so people could see he was on track and keeping his word. or even if he'd promised to set those targets within his first year (you do need to have full control of the books to work that stuff out precisely sometimes).

thanks!  that's helpful info.  and an interesting auto-correct lol.

&gt;i agree that rent control shouldn‚Äôt be removed; and i never said it  should. but it could definitely be adjusted. the way it is now  essentially favours short term tenants for one. a long term tenant  sounds great, until you‚Äôre in my uncles position with a 20 year tenant  where his rent by 2020 was probably 1/2 to 1/3 of the value. because of  rent control he was basically forced to sell the house because it  financially made no sense to keep it, but he couldn‚Äôt evict the tenant  because they would never want to leave as they would have to pay at  least double their current rent for the same size house. so because of  rent control he was basically forced to sell the property.

okay in that case i basically agree with you.

i think it's important to have some sort of rent control, to prevent spikes in rent, but i do think it's sometimes too strict, and shouldn't be so rigid that it makes it unattractive to rent out a suite or build apartments.  there should be some limit on rent increases, but it should be enough to allow rents to generally rise in line with expenses.  something like a max of 4% (a couple % higher than inflation) is reasonable imo.",liberals

there's a study that was done that shows that based on their brain composition, conservative minded people are more likely to fear the unknown than there left leaning counterparts. and too often, with fear, come anger and hatred.  
([https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/conservative-and-liberal-brains-might-have-some-real-differences/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/conservative-and-liberal-brains-might-have-some-real-differences/))  


the problem is when people take advantage of the fear of the unknown, and ask questions designed to make people more scared, and exploit that, we get to where we are today.

fortunately atlantic canada seems to have some real progressive conservatives left, and maybe you're farther away from the utter garbage and nonsense, that i deal with daily in winnipeg, and western canada.

there's nothing wrong with not knowing something! and asking because you want to educate yourself is a good thing. i'm not the best person to answer the cultural questions, but to briefly give a surface understanding:

* women cover themselves to show modesty around unrelated males. culturally, modesty is an important teaching in the quran.
* why are they emigrating? that's a tough question to answer because there are so many layers:
   * fear of religious persecution in religious countries that they are not part of the dominant religion
   * fear of war and conflict in the region or country over religion or other geopolitical issues (us interventionism, etc)
   * while their religion teaches peace, that doesn't stop bad actors from doing terrible things and claiming it in the name of their religion. christianity is also very guilty of this.
   * because for years across the world america, and democracy has been told to be this beacon of hope. when there is conflict in their country, they hear that it's better here, and they do what anyone would do - the best thing they can to protect their loved ones. if that means going to a country that says they are tolerant and accepting of their religion, and is safe, then how can we blame them?

they want a better life for their family. that's it! they don't hate your religion or us at all. those are the few bad exceptions that we hear about because bad news makes for way better ratings. 

and they don't understand things about our culture either, and that's okay. the important thing isn't to let the unknown scare us to the point where we fear or get angry at it. 

the important thing is that everyone generally has the same goals, to have a safe and healthy live, protect their family, and loved ones, and be a part of a good community. if we can remember that, our differences really aren't that big a deal. the cultural differences are something to learn and appreciate, and not fear.

you came at this with the tone of wanting to learn more, and just not knowing, and i respect and appreciate that. we need more of this, and less fear mongering.",conservatives

would you be ok with the liberal party banning the cpc and all other conservative parties, as well as any public support for conservative politicians? because s.33 allows the government to do that. or arresting people and sending them to jail while denying them lawyers and trials for openly being conservative? because that's also allowed by s.33. the point is that s.33 is so antidemocratic and bad for the country that even its existence, much less its use, is a problem. 

also, i don't agree that the courts are worse than parliament, even in the us. the only reason the us has so much judicial influence is because of gridlock in the congress and senate. when politicians are allowed to make laws, they will do so and they won't constantly go to the courts to change how the country runs.",liberals

that's not remotely accurate. none of khadr's torture occurred after harper's refusal to repatriate. it occurred years before that, almost all (if not all) of it before canada knew he was imprisoned. this isn't even up for debate, it is based on khadr's own testimony.

that's the whole point of my disagreement. we are not liable for any of the torture khadr suffered under any legitimate legal theory. the us is. again, contrast the arar case: in that case, canadian agents were intimately involved in the steps that *led to* arar's rendition and torture. in khadr's case, we had no such involvement.

gp37gme,2021-02-27T06:20:40.000-08:00,"liberals rhetorically support ndp pharmacare bill, then vote against it i'm not misrepresenting the timeline at all.

but you come dangerously close to misrepresenting the timeline when you refer to the *full year* that passed between the cda being promised in the 2019 budget (presented in march of 2019) and the canadian covid response (which began in march of 2020) as \"a few months\".

according to the hoskins report you *just* referenced, \"national pharmacare would start with the creation of a canadian drug agency\". that was supposed to be the first step. even if we give the government a bye on 2020, you're absolutely correct that the first work by the cda was supposed to be complete by jan 1 2022.

that means that, even before covid, the liberals had let 1/3 of the time between when they made that commitment in 2019 and the first deadline (at the beginning of 2022) pass *without even forming the agency that was supposed to do the work*.

defending that is absurd. 

and even if the excuse since covid broke out is reasonable, that doesn't change the fact that we're now two years into the period of time the liberals said they needed to get that work done... without the work being started. which will (presumably) push back completion by a similar amount of time.

also, i think you should review the differences between the hoskins report and what the liberals actually promised in their budget. you're right that the hoskins report suggested beginning by covering common and essential drugs starting on jan 1 2022, and then expand it until 2027. but what the liberals promised in their budget was to cover \"high-cost drugs for rare diseases\" starting in 2022-2023. covering drugs for rare diseases is laudable, but it provides a lot less momentum towards pharmacare than the original plan of covering common drugs. there's also zero reference to expanding this list with time. and the funding is stagnant, indicating they don't plan to increase it with time.

work on the formulary is listed completely separately, saying that it \"would provide the basis for a consistent approach to formulary listing and patient access across the country\"... but there's no reference to actually covering the things listed on it. nor to providing funding that might be used to cover them.

i'll admit that it's a little bit of \"read-between-the-line voodoo\" i'm doing when i say that the liberals plan to complete the national formulary before actually covering anything (outside the rare disease stuff in 2022-2023). but a lack of funding, coupled with a conspicuous lack of any statement that the list of covered drugs will gradually increased, coupled with public comments that they view the formulary as a \"foundation\" which needs to exist before they can implement pharmacare certainly point me in that direction.",liberals

but of course the truth is that it **does** intrude on provincial constitutional jurisdiction.   we just pretend it doesn't because we like having a universal health care system.

extracting taxes from the people of a province and the \"gifting\" it back to them in a program that is constitutionally the responsibility of the province and withholding those funds if the province doesn't do as the federal government demands is indisputably interfering in provincial jurisdiction.   imagine for a moment if ontario could use the power of the purse to dictate foreign policy or military policy to the federal government.  we'd all recognize that \"*do as we say or you go bankrupt*\" is obvious interference in their domain.

again, we *pretend* it's not because collectively we don't like the implication of admitting the truth.   it's like how we also *pretend* that taiwan isn't a completely independent country.   we all say one thing while all the time knowing that we're lying to ourselves.   we don't want to deal with the reality so we tell ourselves that the obvious truth is not in fact true.

hdzwfxe,2021-09-23T04:49:43.000-07:00,"ndp should push liberals for public hearings on wealth tax i'm very far from an expert here, but i assume that the basic difficulty of illiquid asset valuation is that you can't just wait until the asset is sold, you need to know what it is worth right now.

would this be as much of an issue for a wealth tax though? for example, if someone bought a classic car for $120k, and has had it for 20 years, it would be difficult to say what it is worth right now, but once it is sold, let's say for $300k, then for tax purposes at least, couldn't you just calculate what it was worth each year along the way by assuming it appreciated in value at a constant rate? and then difference between that calculated value and the value that was already paid and apply it retroactively?

if they have some kind of evidence that can show that a large amount of the increase in value was in the 16th year then they can prove it's value was lower for the first 15 and the tax will be lower for those years. but the burden to prove this is on them and otherwise it just defaults to the simple constant increase model.

basically i'm asking if this is much easier than normal business valuation where you need to know the value now, because the cra fix it retroactively once it sells.",liberals

hdzztc8,2021-09-23T05:13:16.000-07:00,"ndp should push liberals for public hearings on wealth tax this is a great question. i think the answer is: yes, no, and partially.

in the antique car case you brought up, yes it‚Äôs pretty clearly something that gets more valuable overtime. i think anyone can see that in the example. we can definitely both agree that is reasonable. the only thing which may be subjective is if the owner made some improvements to the car that increases value, but let‚Äôs ignore that because it‚Äôs a car and i think we can both agree it‚Äôs fairly straightforward.

in the sale of a business, it might be much harder. let‚Äôs say a company does a series a round in 2016 and sells in 2021. let‚Äôs say:
- it‚Äôs revenues grew from $100k in 2016, $500k in 2017, $1m in 2018, $3m in 2019, $7m in 2020 and $10m in 2021
- it‚Äôs profitability was zero throughout the period as the company was investing in new product lines but increased $1m in 2021 when they stopped investing as heavily in growth 
- in 2017 it added new product features which made it much more attractive to larger customers 
- in 2018 they began offering more products and services - maybe they offered software before but now offer hardware 
- as the company matured it‚Äôs growth started to decrease 
- the valuation increased by $1m to $50m at sale 
- comparable company transaction multiples increased in 2021 due to covid / interest rates 

how do you determine how to retroactively apply the valuation to past years? if you want a simple approach, maybe you use a multiple of sale to past revenue growth. but is it appropriate to apply the multiple on sale back to the initial growth phase? 

if i were the founder, i might argue that market multiples didn‚Äôt increase until 2020/2021 with covid and the investments in the business increased the value. maybe they tried to sell in 2018 but were told the business wasn‚Äôt valuable until certain changes were made. they might also argue they earned no profit until 2021 and a multiple of profit should be used in prior years. 

if i were the tax authorities, i might argue that the valuation as a multiple of revenue decreased from 10x revenue in 2016 to 5x in 2021, because growth has slowed‚Äîso a retroactive approach should actually weigh the earlier revenues higher 

finally, what if they never sell? many private businesses are simply past in generation to generation without being sold at fair market value. this policy assumes there are transactions to go off of when there often might not be. 

this is a very simplistic example, but demonstrates some of the complexity and subjectivity that will lead to court cases, avoidance and unfair application of the tax.",liberals

first, he held onto much of the ndp's base in qu√©bec. singh has not been able to do the same - they went from 25% support there to under 10%. 

second, 2015 was consistent with some of the better ndp results (in popular vote terms and % of seats i believe it was their 3rd best). it was better than layton in 2004, 2006, or 2008. it was also similar to broadbent in 1988 (another leader who got four kicks at the can). 

third, although mulcair did not win, he was taken seriously as a potential pm in a way most ndp leaders have not been. he led in the polls for much of the start of the election campaign. obviously, that's not the same as actually winning, but part of politics is being there at the right time. there have been many moments in recent times where a number of centre-left voters were looking for an alternative to trudeau. i don't think they saw that in singh (whom they like, but don't want to vote for). 

fourth, when trudeau won in 2015 it was by pivoting to the left. why? because he felt pressure from the liberals. has he governed to the left? maybe less than he promised, but certainly more than was the case for liberal leaders of the past 35 years. even if the ndp doesn't win, it can impact change both by negotiating with the liberals in minority parliaments, but perhaps more importantly by altering the strategic calculus of the liberal party. it's easier to do that as a viable alternative government than as a \"conscience of parliament\" party.",liberals

obviously the only solution at this point is technological. but no matter what that will take a long time to develop, and money. the carbon tax is supposed to be revenue neutral for people through the rebate, and then the other portion goes towards green tech investment.

i think where we disagree is i don't believe the carbon tax has hampered this movement. i think canada's structure has just made it very difficult to move forward as was planned.

there is no such thing as ideology-free policy development.

what you describe as:

&gt; objectively assessing information and designing policies to actually achieve a desired goal

that process is *always* constrained by ideological (and epistemological) frames. \"the desired goal\" in the first place is inevitably borne of values, which themselves emerge from a culture and system of belief. but so is the process of \"assessing information.\" everything from deciding what data to collect and how, to the interpretation of that data into meaningful statements, to the final decisions about what to actually *do* \\- there is no escaping the role of ideology in that. this is *especially* true of policy discussions in any political party, where the central question to be answered is \"is this something important that we should be doing?\"

ideology has a useful role to play in guiding policy discussions and \"separating the wheat from the chaff\" in terms of driving forward priorities. it isn't the antithesis of evidence-based policy.

at any rate, i'd dispute the notion that \"the liberal party isn't very ideological.\"

* the party has ideological factions just like any other, most of whom subscribe to different flavours of liberalism (from free market \"blue\" neoliberals, to socially progressive \"orange\" liberals, to broadly centrist nationalists).
* the fact that the liberals have spent a supermajority of the past 100 years in power, and in all that time have never spent less time in power than the government they replaced, and were the last party in power who got to reform the country's constitution, also means a lot of the party's ideological positions are treated as the \"default\" set of values by broader canadian society, which itself lends to the perception that they \"aren't very ideological.\" people don't see it because it's all around them, in the same way a fish might not contemplate the wetness of water.
* the uniting belief that - regardless of faction - what is good for the party is good for canada, and therefore winning elections matters more than any particular set of policy priorities, is most certainly an ideological system in itself, and arguably makes up the beating heart of that party in a way that it doesn't for any other in canada.",liberals

however, the reality of the situation is that if canada wants to bring stability to the region it needs to play the role of providing humanitarian assistance to that country. and, i don't mean taking in refugees (unless they aided our forces, like interpreters), because taking in the educated afghan population will only serve to make the country even more brain dead than it already is and the more uneducated a country is the more unstable it becomes.

i believe that if our gov't is serious in aiding afghans and providing them a bright future, it should play an advisory role to bring stability to afghanistan's economy and creating and maintaining new infrastructure. moreover, by establishing a strong non-military presence/influence i think canada would have a solid chance in deterring more chinese influence in the region. 

these can be done if ottawa establishes (dare i say) diplomatic relations with the new government. however, this does not mean that we have to agree with their methods or everything that they do. in fact, canada has diplomatic relations with plenty of countries whom we disagree with, like china and saudi. on top of that, if we deny their legitimacy but approve other factions' then we may end up instigating another civil war, which would only make matters worse for the afghans.

&gt; as the phrase gained national attention in the early 1980s, merchants objecting to the use of a derisive term to refer to one of the most important shopping days of the year suggested an alternative derivation: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (january through november) and **made their profit during the holiday season**, beginning on the day after thanksgiving. when this was recorded in the financial records, once-common accounting practices would use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts. black friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be \"in the red\", instead taking in the year's profits. [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_friday_\\(shopping\\))]

but given how consumer habits have shifted online, if a tax holiday were given in december, the majority of the benefit to businesses would go to corporate giants who minimize their tax burden in canada (e.g. [2019: amazon to pay $0 in federal taxes](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/amazon-federal-taxes-2019_n_5c660227e4b01757c369c5b3)) and are also not contributing to local tax-bases through property taxes. adjusting the gst in favour of brick and mortar stores and against online only shops would help to alter that negative externality.",conservatives

for the greens specifically, the head of their quebec wing is quoted as saying that they weren't consulted in the drafting of the national platform, and that the purpose of releasing their own was to try and influence paul's stance on quebec issues. pragmatically, the quebec candidates probably also don't want to be needlessly dragged down by paul's stances on issues like loi 96.

remember that the ndp was looking like they had a chance to actually win the popular vote in august 2015, and was polling high with a declining cpc, and a much lower liberal party.  many canadians had picked them as the party to get rid of harper with, but the liberal campaign &amp; platform was simply better on many fronts, and the momentum grew.",liberals

sure, some of the results were devastating and it was disappointing to see some strong candidates lose, but the ndp's problem is structural. first-past-the-post results in a systematic failure to win seats despite holding double-digit support across the country, while the liberal party is both hegemonic among the centre-left and needs to collapse for the ndp a la 2011 to have a path to victory. 

there was also a systematic polling error that probably impacted the ndp's strategy this time around, and led them to campaign offensively in ridings while they should've been shoring up support elsewhere. i would argue these conditions need to change first, and have a bigger influence over the ndp's victories and losses rather than any one leader.

there doesn't even need to be an election.

the gg can just appoint another pm if the government is defeated after a scandal too quickly after an election. the opposition  tolerated a conservative minority government in 2006 after the liberals were tainted by the sponsorship scandal, so why wouldn't they do it again?

&gt; i'm just suggesting there has to be a different raison d'√™tre for the election call that we don't know because everyone just gullibly believes it was a trudeau vanity project.

i'm sorry, that's just backwards. you have no evidence for your claim and you're calling everyone *else* gullible for being skeptical of politicians? 

the media has been anticipating this election since january. trudeau is so transparent. 

&gt; political watchers have been viewing everything through an election lens: the return of trudeau's clean-shaven look, inflation climbing to its highest rate in a decade, the anticipated timing of the canada-u.s. border reopening, a free one-time check for seniors timed for the week of aug. 16, an increased number of in-person funding announcements, and, according to former liberal strategist david herle, the fact liberal mps have been nudged to take their vacations in july.

&gt; election speculation has been simmering since january after a winter cabinet shuffle was interpreted by some as a sign of the government jostling toward a campaign. that cloud of speculation has moved from spring to late summer and fall.

&gt; trudeau has been sending hot and cold messages about his desire for an election. he has repeatedly said his focus is on the pandemic, not an election ‚Äî but also floated that parliament could use a hard reset.

&gt; ‚Äúwe‚Äôre in a minority parliament right now and that means working together,‚Äù said trudeau after making an affordable housing announcement last week in an ottawa suburb. he decried the ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù and ‚Äúobstructionism‚Äù that threatened his government‚Äôs agenda a week earlier, despite working with opposition parties to pass legislation approving record pandemic spending.

&gt; when a reporter asked the prime minister to commit to not calling an election before the house of commons‚Äô scheduled return on sept. 20, trudeau dodged the question ‚Äî fueling further election speculation.

gr2z3yw,2021-03-15T12:41:01.000-07:00,"the albertan government is very upset about a netflix film about bigfoot so the basic context here:

alberta has suffered greatly due to the decline of oil prices. it was already declining pre-pandemic but right now its essentially dead and i think anyone can read between the lines and see that it probably isnt coming back.

our province elected the united conservative party in almost every single riding. albertans have become acclimatized to wealth and people are outraged that they can no longer afford their ways of life. when a young guy used to graduate high school in alberta, they could basically go straight to the oilfields and within a few years can be pulling in a nice 6-figure income with no education. for most people, its kind of a no-brainer. why would you pursue university only to make less and accrue debt?

the ucp capitalised on uneducated outrage, blaming everyone except our own province's poor planning for our position, they promised to bring back oil by fighting tooth-and-nail. they are in the process trying to balance our impossible budget (a huge proportion of our government's income came from oil royalties) but they also campaigned on something called the **oil war room** which is branded as a 30m campaign to fight misinformation and perception of oil. they registered it as a non-governmental organization so it would not be subject to government transparency requirements (extremely greasy).

so basically, while we are realizing that we are going to have to choose between power and food (metaphorically), the government is still funding this completely opaque, mostly ineffectual campaign boondoggle. 

i think most voters would not be aware of its existence or know much about it and for those of us who do, we were already angry about it. this just reinforces how stupid we already suspected it was.",conservatives

for example, if you are driving 4.5 hours/400km from vancouver to kelowna, you can stop halfway for a washroom/breakfast/lunch break and top up the batteries with a fast charger for 30 min. you would have stopped anyway for 20-30 min so what difference does it make?

remember the original liberal party platform from 2011 was \"enact irv ranked ballots\", it was only because of proportional representation advocates in the liberal party like joyce murray and stephane dion that they got trudeau to reluctantly agree to a committee to consider all options, while even back then, in 2011, he was warning about \"the dangers of proportional representation\".

so when the committee comes up with over a hundred expert witnesses saying \"ranked bad, pr better\", when they come up with a mathematical formula saying \"ranked bad, pr better\", when the liberal party's own mps say \"ranked bad, pr better\", trudeau can't argue with that.  all he can do is cancel the plan entirely, and blame it on the ndp.",liberals
