yes. cpc does not have white supremacy in it's platform. that is good. i do not think the party itself outright supports it.

but the cpc has done absolutely nothing over the last decade or two to distance itself from it.

many mp's in the cpc party have personal links to other groups such as proud boys and sons of odin. cpc rank and file have used and have had ties to individuals working with known white supremacists such as faith goldy and others in rebel media.

listen: if the parties are all pointing at the cpc together and saying \"guys, you have a problem\" and the cpc is doing nothing about that problem. turning it around and saying \"stop pointing it out!\" doesn't make the problem go away.

liberals have absolutely insinuated it. because we've all be insinuating it. anyone who is not a white supremist has been questioning it. i would bet members of the cpc who aren't also in that camp are wondering why the party rank and file is allowing the cpc to continue to have these members in it (even fi they are just back benchers)

it certainly doesn't help when the goal-posts on what constitutes \"white supremacy\" have been continuously shifting.  a decade ago you would have to be a self-professed neo-nazi or member of a far-right, explicitly racist group.

now, you can be considered a \"white supremacist\" by the left by doing any of the following (certainly not an exhaustive list):

\\- expressing criticism of immigration policies

\\- favouring legislation that emphasizes religious secularism in the public sector

\\- referencing a proprietary canadian culture that is not comprised of multiculturalism as a core element.

\\- criticizing \"critical race theory\" or other various forms of identity politics.

the cpc might be able to distance itself from \"white supremacy\" if the definition was consistent and hasn't been morphed on-the-fly to include things like \"not wanting to change the name of dundas\" or openly supporting police as a counter-weight to the defund movement.

it seems like every 2-3 years we have to re-calibrate our definition of what \"white supremacy\" consists of.",liberals

again, i'm not sure if you're being disingenuous here, or are simply unaware. among some other stuff, the bill does two different things:

(1) increases local control by shifting from the federal gov't to municipalities to ban *possession* of handguns;

(2) decreases regional control by removing from individual provinces the current discretion to issue atcs for the *carry* of handguns (generally restricted only to the wilderness for wildlife protection), and shifting that solely to federal jurisdiction.

the second one is diametrically opposed to the argument that communities should have more control.

now that you're up to speed, i'll ask again. *given that you're in favour of the proposed municipal power, on the grounds that localized control is a good thing, are you opposed to the fact that the bill also does the opposite on a similar with respect to the provinces?*

pretending that the power to call an election rests with the government rather than the opposition in a minority government, is frankly absurd and only exists to deflect blame for when the election is called. the lpc has no obligation to present a budget, or any other confidence matter, such that the other parties are happy to agree to it. either the parties have confidence in the government, or they do not. 

and quite frankly, existing in a state of 'non-confidence but not willing to actually do anything about it' just undermines the whole point of having an opposition in a minority government situation at all. 

there is no real debate around this bill; we're in a pandemic, make elections as safe as possible.",liberals

what i know is that without proper incentives, programs are ripe for abuse. if the idea of ubi is to tackle things like housing and food so people are not impoverished, there needs to be clear incentives to spend that money on those things and disincentives to spend it on other things that don’t further those objectives, otherwise it’s just not an efficient program. welfare has that. there is a level of oversight into how the money granted is spent and there’s a requirement to be seeking better job opportunities to get yourself off of it. the problem is the payout it offers today is in many cases not enough to sustain a basic standard of living. so again, i’d rather see it enhanced so it pays enough to cover that, but keep the incentives in place that ensure the money goes to those who truly need it and there is some accountability for how it is spent.",conservatives

everyone has some degree of luck, but it also matters what you do with opportunities when they present themselves. taking jobs you may not love because it will afford you a new set of skills. working while in school to lessen the financial burden of it. packing your lunch every day instead of buying it to save more money. the list goes on and on.

asking for the state to cover any program for you is quite literally asking for a handout. not saying it may not be a worthwhile one, but that is of course what it is. you want something, you can’t afford it, so you want it to be afforded to you. and as i already said i think child care *should* be affordable. i just think the public policy approach being pursued is missing a lot of the bigger issues with why it became so expensive to begin with.",conservatives

many day cares operated on a model where they'd have feeders of infants in care at a loss because of a low ratio of care workers:children that led to profitable pre-schools with high care workes:children before senior kindergarten. full day junior kindergarten definitely hurt.

operating a day care is a low to middle class occupation. child care workers make just more than minimum wage ([$16.02/h](https://ca.talent.com/salary?job=child+care+worker)). 

i imagine you're not cogniscent of how profit works, but these are small businesses, so profit means the owner's take home. it's averaging $33k/year according to this report. https://askwonder.com/research/ontario-daycare-market-vq2ehgeda

even this giant a for-profit day care, kids &amp; company ltd., with $50m in revenue for 1000 employees runs at $50k revenue per employee. walmart has $240k revenue per employee by comparison. 

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/how-a-mother-of-eight-built-a-daycare-empire/article11732198/

even so, it was not profitable on retail child care.

&gt; *you've experienced very rapid growth since you opened, but posted a seven-figure loss in 2007. is the company profitable?*

&gt; we're definitely profitable now. we make our profits from our corporate clients. it's very tricky to run a high-quality child care business and have the business itself be highly profitable because then you'd be taking money away from the needs of the children. we developed our growth and profits through our corporate relationships.",conservatives

for a lot of people who vote liberal, the ndp is the vastly preferred second choice, and if the lpc was not seen as viable, i could easily imagine trudeau being unable to revive the party's fortunes like he did. 

similarly, its difficult to say whether or not a ndp minority or majority government would have affected the return of the bloc. assuming that the ndp had a similar honeymoon to the lpc throughout the 2015-2019 term, and didn't have a scandal like snc-lavalin, its very possible they would have kept carrying on with fairly high levels of support, even in quebec.",liberals

it's bizarre to believe that conservatives will never again form government in canada, especially given our fptp system. even when the tories die, they are replaced by a new right wing party with a different label. who cares if they call themselves reform, caq, or the saskatchewan party or whatever? eventually the leftist or centrist government will get long in the teeth or there will be a scandal or ten and people in ontario, for example, will elect a right leaning government as a matter of course no matter who's in charge or what they're proposing - witness ford winning with no platform and having barely scraped together a high school education. 

as for *hak*, they aren't asking the court to ignore the constitution - they are asking for a novel and, tbh, pretty long shot interpretation of certain clauses. they are doing so because the caq government is using s.33 to ignore the rights of minorities in quebec.

the same thing happened with the churchill statues: the man was a major force **against** the nazis, offered persecuted jews asylum in the uk, and later helped form the state of israel.

sir john a macdonald statues have been taken down all over the country. not only were residential schools very different in the beginning, but their goals were wholesome and supported by indigenous people (i'll come back to that at the end). sir john a was very progressive for his time: he supported giving natives their ancestral lands (which is why reserves were established), he was adament about getting famine relief to all people including natives saving thousands of natives in the process, and he was behind the small pox vaccination program which saved thousands upon thousands of lives and he prioritized natives due to their lack of immunity to the illness. the man was not a foe to native people, but a friend. he didn't even establish residential schools, they existed before he became pm.

we hear lots of terrible things about the residential school system but generally don't know the entire story. the residential schools were supported in the late 1800s by native people as they had asked the canadian government for accessible education for their children. they were initially day schools and non-compulsory, each student who chose to would attend school for a year and rarely longer. very few native children attended schools that were not day schools and this remained until the 1920s. it's silly to think that sir john a is one of many who are blamed for mistreatment of natives when they weren't a part of it.

*at best* paul and her team have horribly mismanaged this situation. this is her introduction to many canadians. repudiating zatzman's remarks should be a *complete no-brainer.* instead she's lashing out at chrystia freeland and justin trudeau, and allowing the internal situation to fester. the number one rule for a political staffer is \"don't become a liability.\" it should go without saying that the green party's most important assets are its elected representatives! allowing a party staffer to threaten them, and then failing to promptly offer support, shows a total lack of political savvy. it's actually hard to explain - unless, paul actually supports zatzman's remarks, and really does believe that atwin, manly, jagmeet singh etc. are anti-semites, and can't bring herself to put this situation to bed properly. or maybe it's that she's struggling to distance herself from zatzman because he's one of the few allies she has in the party. or maybe she's an idiot. if any of these things are true, she can't continue to lead the party.

i think the disconnect is the nature of who we elect.  a lot of people conceive of their vote as being for a party, but we're voting for an individual, and their party is secondary.

this is in contrast with, say, a proportional representation system, where you give your votes to the party, and which members get elected depend on which proportion of seats they earn.

edit:

i'll try to cover some of the feedback i'm getting.

most of us, in our decision making process, vote for a candidate based on their party affiliation.

the actual electoral system is basically ignorant of the party.  you aren't telling the electoral system which party you want to be elected, nor which prime minister you'd like to see.  you are telling the electoral system which person you would like to represent your riding.  mostly by convention, that person belongs to a party, and mostly by convention, that party votes together in parliament, and mostly by convention, the leader of the party with the most seats is asked to form a government.

but your vote, regardless of how you arrived at it, is for one person to represent your riding.  the system itself doesn't care if or what party they're in, and this is why they can change party at will.  you chose that person to represent your riding, not their party, regardless of how you arrived at your choice (ie by party affiliation).",liberals

you were right to point out in your other comment that it is only 3/36, so a lot could still change. every léger poll seems to confirm that there is a lot of volatility about who one will vote for in québec right now, especially amongst the bq-leaning voters. we'll have to see how the debates go. we could see another bq surge near the end of the campaign again. 

if we're hoping to keep the liberals at a minority (i think a cpc government is not within reach at this time) we'll have to keep a close eye on how the ndp does in the gta and just how much momentum the bloc gains in québec. there are a number of ridings in the greater montréal area that are bq-lpc swings and ridings around capitale-nationale that are bq-cpc swings, with a few 3-way races too. there are scenarios where votes are split enough between the bq and cpc in certain ridings where the lpc could come up the middle.",liberals

harper didn’t really balance the budget though. they played with some numbers on the year of the election by making one time sales (such as gm stocks) to claim the budget was balanced - that’s not truly balancing the budget. if i’m bleeding 2000$ a month and sell my car for 2000$, i haven’t balanced the budget at all - i might have net 0 this month but next month i’m still -2000$ and still without a car. *how* the budget is balanced is important - if it’s by selling assets it’s a worthless political stunt. 

notice, however, that for the majority of harpers term, *until* 2014/15 the debt to gdp ratio was actually rising. trudeau got in in 2015 and yes, his first year did raise the debt to gdp ratio - but every subsequent year he grew the economy more then the deficit, and by the time of 2019 he had the debt to gdp ratio around where harper had it when he left office. 

the big bar at the end is covid, because having a pandemic absolutely nuke the world economy (and lower gdp) will do that, but this is a debt to gdp we see everywhere in the world with covid - the us (whose gdp is enormous) included. it’s a temporary blip however and as the economy recovers it will come down fast.

but in either case - otoole is selling the same story the liberals were when trudeau got elected. he is saying he’s not making cuts and will allow the economy to grow and gradually reduce our debt to gdp. if that doesn’t fly for trudeau it’s not okay for otoole, and it is a bit hypocritical given they have been attacking him on this front for years.

also, on the inflation angle - our 2020 inflation rate was a mere 0.72% and before that has been fairly stable for a long time (decades). trudeau’s deficits really weren’t driving a large increase in inflation.

changing voting systems, especially to something more complicated than fptp, is absolutely an exercise in proper education and messaging. especially since the status quo among the populace is to resist changes to things they've known all their life.

this is true, and i blame it on deliberate confusion spread by the powers that be, that do not want the change. including spreading the confusing, illogical idea that you finished with,

as the other commenters replied to you: why not? this is what democracy is. these people exist, and they think that way, for a reason - it's up to everyone else to figure out why, if they want to engage with it. not to silence their voice, or throw their votes away as meaningless in a system that favours only two big mainstream do-nothing parties. 

if ppc supporters are mad about [topic x] enough to vote for it nationally in 5-10% numbers, it is a serious topic that the whole country should discuss more thoroughly! 

i'll use immigration as a handy example, i'm relatively pro-immigration overall, but i 100% understand why the opponents of immigration get angry: it's all done in shady ways, behind closed doors, annual quotas are not up for the public to decide, we have no certainty that there are adequate supports etc., and many other issues. the topic of immigration is something worth discussing, and everyone's voice is valid. mixed-member proportional type systems would ensure that 5% of the voice at the table, would be ppc's. instead, they get shut out of politics, and their supporters become *more* extreme over time, as they perceive their concerns are being ignored.",liberals

be aware of your local political situation. we tend to talk a lot about topline federal or provincial numbers, but every riding is different. if you wish to be an *effective* abc (anyone but conservative) voter, you should develop a voting and donation strategy that makes sense for your riding. \"strategic voting\" effectively is more involved than most people think, but a good starting point is identifying the strongest non-tory party in your riding and making sure you vote for them, even if you donate to another party that has the best chance of defeating conservatives nationally or provincially. 

be gentle but firm in your support of your cause in person in face to face conversation. people need to see that this matters to real people who they know and care about, not just faceless villains they can demonise on the internet or screaming jerks who make them feel bad. avoid falling into the trap of thinking that online activism makes much of a difference. we are different people online, and slacktivism just leads to echo chambers and detachment.

you should also consider subscribing to a major news outlet. the frailty of traditional news media that at least attempts neutral and reflective investigative reporting has been an enormous boon to the rise of the far right.

federal issues important to me are election reform, housing, indigenous issues, and the crtc.

you've already attempted to brush off election reform.

\"god stop talking about voting reform its a 5 year old issue\"? **no, i don't think i will.**

on housing, the liberals have this to say:we will undertake a review of escalating home prices in high-priced markets – like vancouver and toronto – to determine whether speculation is driving up the cost of housing.

&amp;#x200b;

the ndp has this to say:

jagmeet and the ndp have a plan to tackle the housing crisis – including building 500,000 new units of affordable housing starting right away, and dealing with the speculation and money laundering that fuel skyrocketing housing prices.

&amp;#x200b;

on indigenous issues, i do not feel well-versed, but i do know that the liberals have a long history of talking about it and not doing much. one issue i am familiar with and have been following is clean water. while promising to end all of the **long term drinking water advisories** by march of this year, they only solved 2/3rds of them and are being flakey about the rest. ndp and greens are committed to spending what needs to be spent and ending **all drinking water advisories.**

not sure why i am bothering to type this all out to you. the liberals have disappointed me. i see hope with the ndp. i think they have earned a chance with the reins.

i understand elections have consequences. do the liberals understand their actions have consequences? not adequately pursuing election reform will have consequences. impossible you say?

&gt;the special committee on electoral reform was created in the spring of 2016, and it delivered its report in december. it proposed two things. the first was that canada replace its traditional system of voting (the ­single-member plurality system known widely as the first-past-the-post model) with a proportional system of representation (where seats in the house of commons would be allocated according to the proportion of votes each party received). second, it recommended that the idea be put to a referendum. both notions were poisonous to the liberals, and trudeau abandoned the commitment.

as far as \"creeping totalitarianism\" i dont think most people see it the same way. sure the masks suck, but they're more of an inconvenience than anything. vaccine passports have existed in europe for ages. you can't enroll in any school without your vaccines being up to date, im pretty sure we have that here too...",conservatives

hcavi2y,2021-09-09T22:01:22.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - friday, september 10, 2021 my overall impression of the debate organization: not great.

1. they should've had more debates with fewer people. the formats used was simply not conducive to five people having actual exchanges. tva and french wasn't too bad, but it still paled in comparison to previous years. also not having another english commission debate really handicapped o'toole and generally gave less opportunities for candidates to, well, debate

2. what is with this terrible debate sequencing? we had to wait two weeks for the first debate in a 4 1/2 week election, which wasn't even a commission debate, and then we get back-to-back debates in both french and english? just awful

3. english debate was a uniquely terrible experience to watch as a viewer. moderator and organization was a mess

4. topics simply weren't catered as well as they could've been, especially for the english debate. i would really rather focus on issues like affordability and covid instead of china considering how little time we had. and because of that, we had to wait a whole hour and 40 minutes before we actually talk about the defining issue of the day.

have the province announced a cap on rent based on mortgage, or potential mortgage (for homes with no mortgage). and have this come into effect in a 2 year time.

then, announce immediately that first time home buyers can apply for a down payment loan of 0% interest over 10-15years.

1.) nationhood. quebecois are a nation, just like any of the first nations. the first nations are just much, much older.

2.) unitary language. i do have an issue with this, but it's not in the way most people would think. i have an issue with official languages period. i think that we need to go to people in the vernacular. if you have a lot of people in your area who speak cantonese, you should oblige them and print your government notices in that language as well as the others popularly spoken nearby. we should be translating all federal and provincial communication and making it freely available to print.

that of course doesn't jive with the law as written, but i guess if quebec *had* to have an official language, then yeah, it's very clearly french. i worry about what effect this law will have on minority access to government service, but i suspect that they have a solution to that.",liberals

&gt;and you can look even deeper. many many studies have shown the importance of the first few years in a child's life and the positive impact high quality childcare can provide. did you know that every dollar invested in childcare pays out more in adulthood than any another level of education? regardless of whether or not you have children, this helps our economy and society in the future, and that benefits all of us.",conservatives

it's tough for me to take \"gender/diversity statements\" seriously when they are *obviously* not being done in a neutral way. they will very specifically mention certain groups when they are disadvantaged, but clearly ignore other groups when they are the disadvantaged ones. that's...the opposite of what a diversity impact statement should be about.",liberals

here's the affordability promise from 2019:

&gt; to make life more affordable for canadians, cut our 
emissions, and protect the environment, we will 
move forward with a plan to:
- help retrofit 1.5 million homes to help canadians make their homes more energy efficient, and better protect them from climate-related risks; 
- give interested homeowners and landlords  a free energy audit;
- help homeowners and landlords pay for  retrofits by giving them an interest-free  loan of up to $40,000;
- help people buy newly built homes that are certified zero-emissions by giving them a net zero homes grant of up to $5,000; and $40kinterest free loan for green renovations
- invest $100 million in skills training, to ensure there are enough qualified workers to keep up with energy audits, retrofits, and net-zero  home construction.

also, in 2019 there were $15mil for affordable homes for veterans:

&gt; to address veterans’ homelessness, we will move 
forward with building new, purpose-built accessible 
and affordable housing units, with a full range of 
health, social, and employment supports for veter-
ans who need extra help. we will support this work 
with an additional investment of $15 million a year.

carbon pricing at a higher rate than basically anywhere in the world

a clean fuel standard to make sure fuels are cleaner over time when they're used

an electric vehicle mandate to make sure new cars are electric over time

phasing out coal in the electricity sector

way more funding for building retrofits and more funding for public transportation

way more funding to reduce emissions in industry

in my opinion, if there's a program that can solve so many of society's problems with so little energy, it's completely logical to be skeptical. so i wouldn't blame political figures who have a legitimate shot of winning power to brush off the idea. 

one of the issues i've seen is that ubi proponents simply don't make a compelling argument because it can take so many different forms depending who you are speaking with. there are ubi proposals that would straight up horrify progressives, while others would horrify conservatives. but when you ask people their thoughts they never make those distinctions.

furthermore, almost all ubi proposals i've ever seen have massive downsides that are always played down. for example, the green party's ubi proposal, although incredibly vague, would conservatively cost tens of billions of dollars in net-new spending. some of the more conservative ubi proposals i've seen would result in massive cuts to social services to people with severe disabilities under the guise of \"streamlining\".

incorrect.  the pfizer vaccine is 94% effective at preventing asymptomatic infections and 97% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, severe disease and death.

&gt;it does not prevent you from getting the disease. it does not prevent you from spreading the disease.

incorrect.  as stated above, it is 94% effective at preventing infection meaning the vaccinated host does not even carry the virus.

are you suggesting the mortality rate of the vaccine is 4%?  as in, 4% of the people who have been vaccinated have died?  i'm not even going to fact check that one for you.

no one is mandating you to do anything.  you are within your right not to get the vaccine, but that may come with certain social restrictions.  take it or leave it.

genocide is normally associated with government action, but it really is open to any actors so long as the effect is the destruction of a specific ethnic group or demographic.

canada, as represented by the canadian government, isn't committing genocide right now, but there is still genocide happening here as a result of the murder of indigenous women.",liberals

sure. but they retained 25%. they lost the soft nationalist vote, and another 10% because quebecers in rural areas like to vote for the winning party to keep the pork coming.

it's guaranteed in the constitution (bna act). it requires a constitutional amendment that includes the consent  of quebec anglophones. it's blatantly unconstitutional.
