further more after the election cases spiked up drastically from a 7 day average of 88k, all the way up to 269k. and it took 2 months for that to start falling.

finally look at the result from issues people felt happen, there capitol was stormed by terrorists whipped up because of the issues they felt happened.

i can't for the life of me see why you would look at the us election and think \"ah this is a model on how to do things\" the only answer is because you don't know what your talking about.

there's increasing court cases on the results of the newfoundland election due to the massive amount of problems that happened during it, that can lead to the whole election being thrown out.

the vote in the riksdag is one where all members vote, and if an absolute majority, 175 in the case of sweden out of 349, or more, vote against the nominee, they are not given confidence, but any other  outcome means that the nominee is approved. it gives cover for a minority government, as its allies can abstain without hurting the ability of the government to be chosen. 

other countries have rules like a legislative runoff in the event that they go too many weeks without picking someone with a majority, forcing the mps to make a choice whether they want to or not. as well, they may have rules after the choice is made that to depose a government, majority or not, they need to specify who replaces the prime minister as well as the majority necessary to oust the current one.

you are correct. 95% of cargo shipped by air worldwide is flown on passenger flights. the aircraft i fly carries roughly 20,000kg per flight of cargo -- and that's with a cabin up top rammed full with 400 passengers. we are currently operating a raft of flights with passenger aircraft, but only taking cargo -- some of these are just empty passenger airplanes using only the capacity in the cargo holds (~20 tons, depending on what we're carrying -- can go upwards of 40t), but some flights are now being done with aircraft that have had the seats ripped out in order to carry lightweight bulky cargo (think ppe... gloves, syringes, masks) in the cabin where the passengers normally go. this is only worth our while because the lack of passenger flights (which would normally carry the aforementioned 95% of all air cargo) are severely curtailed, so the price-per-kilo for air cargo sits around 500% of the normal. canadian consumers are going to start seeing this in the form of inflated prices for many consumer goods, notably groceries. do you like mangoes? i hope you enjoy paying big bucks for them -- we are doing freighters to south america to bring back fresh mangoes, and the price tag on those flights approaches $1m each round-trip. you're not getting mangoes for $2 each anymore -- those used to come back as incidental cargo on the lima and santiago flights, but now dedicated flights have to be sent to go get them, and that's not cheap.

so yes. closing the airports entirely will royally fuck up our supply chains. i have seen proposals for canada to do what australia does with its aircrew -- if you return from outside australia as a pilot, you are forced into a two-week quarantine in a hotel (not allowed to see your family in the meantime!). this, in canada's situation, would result in us running out of pilots to crew these essential cargo flights in a matter of days -- we can barely get the flights we have on roster now staffed because of rest requirements, never mind if each pilot was knocked off the schedule for two weeks after each arrival!",conservatives

not only that, xi has now discarded the 10-year leadership term set up by deng xiaoping (followed by both jiang zemin and hu jintao).

the basic divide in international politics is between those countries which support the status quo (basically the us and its allies) and those opposed to it (like the soviet union during the cold war). in the later stages of the cold war, china was a de facto us ally (see odd arne westad's *restless empire*). for some time after that, china had a sizable stake in the status quo, given its rapid economic growth and its trade with the west. but it's now clear that china under xi jinping is seeking to elbow the us out of the way - the weakness of us power under the trump interregnum didn't help.

so canada and china are on opposite sides of this divide. and yet china is also canada's #2 trading partner, a major customer for agricultural products and natural resources.

i'd suggest that canada's approach to international politics should be something like this:

  - as always, maintaining national unity has to be our top priority. (this is especially important when dealing with climate change, given the impact on alberta.)

  - with the us stepping back to deal with major internal challenges, an emboldened china, and smaller powers more willing to pursue an aggressive foreign policy as well (turkey, saudi arabia, ethiopia), the world is a more dangerous place. canada will need to pay more attention to national security and put more money into building up our hard and soft power: intelligence, cyber-security, military, diplomacy, foreign aid, alliances (especially with the uk, europe, japan, and south korea).

  - to maintain the balance between means and ends, we should also be cautious about taking on ambitious foreign-policy goals. the government of canada is not responsible for the well-being of everyone, everywhere.

  - when dealing with china, canadian elected officials should be extremely polite, but not friendly. canada and china are on opposite sides of the status quo.

  - on the specific question of taiwan, i'd suggest that the goal of the west should be to [push china to back off](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/mtxpud/its_time_for_canada_to_embrace_democratic/gv3uvk7/) for another 20 years or so.

george f. kennan, in a [1999 interview](https://groups.google.com/g/soc.culture.indian/c/hs3dtvspvwu/m/jrz4lp7mnyoj?pli=1):

&gt; the chinese, to my opinion, are the french of asia. the two peoples are similar in a number of respects. they are both proud people. both are conscious of being the bearers of a great cultural tradition. they don't really, in either case, like foreigners; or at least they don't particularly appreciate the presence of foreigners in their midst. they like to be left alone. our policy, in any case, should in my opinion be to **treat them with the most exquisite courtesy and respect on the official level, but not expect too much of them**. i see no reason, in particular, for all these ups and downs in our perceived relations with china. what do we expect of the chinese? they are not going to love us, no matter what we do. they are not going to become like us. and it really is in ill grace for us to be talking down to them and saying, by implication, that \"you ought to learn to govern yourselves as we do.\" for goodness' sake, can't we get away from that sort of nonsense? let people be what they are, and treat them accordingly.
&gt;
&gt; ... this whole tendency to see ourselves as the center of political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part of the rest of the world strikes me as unthought-through, vainglorious, and undesirable. if you think that our life here at home has meritorious aspects worthy of emulation by peoples elsewhere, the best way to recommend them is, as john quincy adams maintained, not by preaching at others but by the force of example. i could not agree more.",liberals

&gt;
&gt;canada complied with an extradition that we could see at the time was (and has since been confirmed to be) based in trade negotiations rather than actual wrongdoing.  we chose the us side and *instigated* this exchange. 

where in the rules governing extradition is it up to the country making the arrest to decide if it's valid or not?

&gt;china retaliates by arresting 2 canadians who absolutely meet the profile of intelligence assets. they may not have been, and we'll probably never know. but i find it hard to believe that arguably the only westerner with a personal relationship with kim jong un isn't connected with csis in any way. 

do you believe they got fair trials? if so why were they released?

&gt;and canada's acting like we were just following the rules and were the victim here? we arrested someone on trumped-up charges to kick this thing off. i don't like what china's done in response but the perspective we're given on this is deeply flawed.

in my view you had a progressive, conservative, and technocratic groups. my memory is pretty hazy about specifics now but the progressives wanted the party to fully brand itself as progressive, bring its party logo in line with the international pirate movement, and kept proposing changes to different aspects of the party. the conservatives opposed the previous points, and wanted protections for eventual pirate mps to voice their conscience outside platform issues. the technocrats handled the party's upkeep but couldn't really be put into either of the other two categories. take my opinion with a grain of salt though, as my username suggests i was a member of the conservative group.",conservatives

this was in response to various organizations and public figures (correctly) stating that climate change is a health emergency; the somewhat logical extension, at the time, being that the expected harm is orders of magnitude worse than covid-19 has been and so we might expect similar, or worse, restrictions on public behaviour.

secondly, i really don't think canadians in general care all that much about this holiday. it thrust upon the country at the absolute last minute, which meant for huge swaths of the country it isn't a day off at all because no employer had the time to work it into their schedules. at the same time, at least here in halifax, we had the mass transit system decide it was going to go on holiday hours-- despite the fact that most of those who rely on the buses didn't have the day off. and nova scotia is one of the few provinces in this country that'd made it a public holiday.

to be fair, that was an explanation given to me by somebody employed by an american pharmaceutical company who was involved in the development of one of the vaccines. he was involved in the development of one of the mrna vaccines, so it was likely his perspective on why it had taken so long to develop a vaccine.

so - in my books it's ridiculous to look at it as a 'woman's rights' issue. the only reason others should even potentially be involved is if it's a human rights issue, specifically the rights of a child. if the fetus is not a child - then why the hell are we talking about it any more than we would removing a wart? and if it is - then a 'woman's rights' take a back seat to the child's right to life. 

so the only practical question is - is the potential abortee a human, or not? if it's a human then rights attach and we don't kill children in our society. if it isn't - what the hell are we talking about it for?

so this of course is the problem - how do we define when a human becomes a human? 

i take a practical attitude - the most logical definition of when someone comes into being should be the definition of when they leave existance.  we can simulate the heart, any other body component except one - the brain. we consider someone to be dead when brain activity stops entirely. we could keep the body alive, but if the brain is completely dead we consider the person deceased, and even if the body was alive they wouldn't be considered a 'person'. 

so logically if brain death is the end of a 'person', then they become a person when the brain starts. we do know that in humans the brain comes online and actuallly begins to take over control of bodily functions around about 15 weeks. i'm not talking about a random neuron firing, but actually regulating heart rate and such. 

so a practical legal definition to me would be to say that after that point the 'fetus' becomes a 'person' - with their own brain controlling their own body parts etc. sure they're dependent on someone else but so is someone in a coma - that doesn't make them dead. especially if it's temporary. 

i'm giving the short version of course. but i think it's both a logically and legally defensible position. 

having said that - i don't approve of abortion as a rule and i'd like to see more resources going into supporting women willing to carry the child to term and to make adoption easier and better. we don't have enough children to replace our own population as it is :)",conservatives

 &gt;canadian federalism (french: fédéralisme canadien) involves the current nature and historical development of the federal system in canada. canada is a federation with eleven components:  the national government of canada and ten provincial governments. all eleven governments derive their authority from the constitution of canada. there are also three territorial governments in the far north, which exercise powers delegated by the federal parliament, and municipal governments which exercise powers delegated by the province or territory.

no one in the working class has the time to seethe and report people for calling them a slur. they're too busy working themselves to death so the higher socioeconomic classes can stand on their shoulders, ignore them at best, and demean and dehumanize them at worst. you know what else? this will be encouraged aggressively. it's extremely telling that calling someone a \"jerk\" can get you banned for a week on social media, but calling a dishwasher a \"dishpiggie\" or a mechanic a \"greasy hick scam artist\" is worthy of hundreds of dollars in reddit awards with no moderation in sight.

regardless of political policy, both sides do it just as much. if anything i hate it even more when the liberals do it, because they gallivant around, ignoring the working and lower middle class while arrogantly demanding to be seen as the hero of the people for being progressive when convenient or beneficial for them. even if my politics don't align with your politics, at least you guys have the backbone to say what you mean and stick to it instead of cowering behind pandering to people you don't care about so you don't actually have to help the citizens in the country, and i respect the hell outta that. it's probably why 95% of my friends are right of me.

it's people who live in gated (mostly white\\*) communities that demand all this progressive shit. they've never dealt with confrontation or any legitimate struggle in real life, so someone disagreeing with them? that's literally assault as far as their hyper-privileged asses are concerned. none of the stuff they clamour for will even affect them because they don't live in the cities, and their job is secure because of their privileged upbringing.

yet they have the audacity to call me a racist for not wanting to have to compete with immigrants being exploited by employers, which goes against my politics *and* it puts me in a situation to be exploited myself, wanting actual *canadians* to own homes, instead of multinational billion dollar rental conglomerations, or \"not an ally\" because i consider home ownership and being able to actually afford to eat 1500 calories a day more important than giving someone who doesn't understand pronouns a hard time.

i'm not going to change my political affiliation over it, but i'm definitely not voting liberal ever again if this goes through. i'll intentionally waste it on ndp out of spite until i or the ndp dies.

^(\\*there is nothing wrong with being white or living in close proximity to other whites unless you're doing to specifically to avoid people of color, and even then i wouldn't force you not to. i'd just not hang out with you, it's a free country. that said, i find it extremely amusing a lot of these limo-libs don't have any experience with the issues they're trying to solve with one catch-all solution at all costs to everyone around them, except for themselves.)",liberals

hoidm15,2021-12-13T21:48:16.000-08:00,"canada has planted only 8.5m of 2b trees promised by trudeau so far it takes time to grow seedlings and nursery capacity. also, it takes time to develop experienced treeplanters and contractors that can perform the logistically challenging work which is often in remote/austere conditions.    

trees can only be planted in seasonally appropriate timeframes which means that the labour pool for planters is only going to work for, at the very most if they can relocate cross country, 5-6 months a year. it generally takes 40-50 planting days experience (about 2 months) to get a planter to ~80% of their ultimate production numbers. that is for simple planting ie straight pine/spruce replanting in non-technical ground. if you get into technical ground (non flat) with specie mixtures and picky foresters then it takes a lot more experience for planters and companies to manage.

[here's roughly what treeplanting in canada looks like before the 2 billion federal trees](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2019/11/how-many-trees-are-planted-in-canada.html)   

308m  british columbia   
  86m  alberta   
  13m  saskatchewan   
    8m  manitoba   
101m  ontario   
132m  quebec   
  40m  atlantic provinces   
688m  canada-wide      

now if the federal government wants to inject 250m~ more trees into that stream each year we have to think about the working population to grow/plant the trees. for the vast majority planters are either students or seasonal workers who utilize ei yearly. there are maybe ~8000 treeplanters across canada on a yearly basis. maybe 3000 are 'experienced' in the sense that they plant to 90% their capacity. maybe 1000 are experienced in the sense they know how to plant technical specs and hard terrain.    

some companies don't fully fill the timeframe of their potential planting seasons. on top of the current ~688m trees planted, the federal government could probably squeeze an extra 100m trees into the current industry's excess experienced capacity. but the industry still needs to generate 15-20% more planting capacity. it takes several seasons to train people to run planting crews and camps. contractors also have to procure equipment to run remote camps (generators, mobile kitchens, showers/hygiene facilities).    

there is a time factor that is mostly contingent on growing seedlings and then growing the experienced labour pool (this could easily take 3 years). this ramp up could be slightly expedited by doing something like using prisoners for forced labour and pouring a ton of money to procure facilities in the most uneconomic fashion (versus planting contractors that generally work on hyper efficient, shoestring budgets).    

i don't suspect that it will be difficult to find labour to plant these trees. the total projected pricetag for the effort is about $3/tree total which is easily 60-70% more than what private industry spends. i doubt much will trickle down to planters but if the planters see $/tree rise from an average of .15 currently to .18 when the federal trees are blended in then it represents a big boost. instead of making $400/day for a 50 day season they can make $480/day for 80 day seasons. will that be enough to draw the 2000 extra planters that will be needed?  i would definitely consider it as a student if i could make 30-35k/summer.   

will significantly rob the student of workplace experience and networking by forgoing co-op placements or useful summer jobs but at least they won't be too poor and indebted when they finish school. they will also either be in better physical condition or they will develop chronic back, knee, and shoulder issues.",liberals

ever since the 2008 housing crash in the us, the federal government's been trying to cool off the canadian housing market, both under harper and trudeau. harper brought the max amortization period back down to 25 years; trudeau brought in the mortgage stress test (now at 5.25%) and the first-time homebuyer initiative (which is equity-like, so if prices go down ottawa absorbs part of the loss).

in the city of vancouver, the mayor's been pushing hard to get more purpose-built rental approved; the province and the city have both brought in a bunch of new measures (airbnb regulation, the 15% foreign buyer surtax, the annual empty homes tax, and a bunch of others).

for a first-time homebuyer, i think the dilemma is: it's obvious the market is overheated and expensive, but if you wait, it could be that prices rise even further out of reach. looking at the us housing crash and at high price-to-rent ratios, it seems like **eventually** the insanity of the market will fade - again, we're not running out of land - but that could be years away. (\"markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\")

somebody asked a while back whether they should stretch themselves to buy a house - they didn't really need it right now, they were okay with renting for a few years, but they were worried that by the time they needed to buy, prices would be even worse.

the problem is that there's a lot of uncertainty. thinking about the worst case:

1. if you borrow a lot of money and buy now - worst case is that there's a crash.

2. if you continue renting instead of buying now - worst case is that prices keep going up.

i guess the question is, between these two worst-case scenarios, which of the two is more acceptable - owning a place that you borrowed heavily to pay for and is now worth a lot less, or renting indefinitely because owning is completely out of reach?

i think renting indefinitely, and saving for retirement by investing, is a legit option - people believe that renting is \"throwing your money away,\" but it's not true.

for a literal answer, it is due to oka and ipperwash. two protests ~~in ontario~~ that ended in bloodshed. because of this, any police action against native protests is basically seen as a pr nightmare, and the opp officially changed policy to not enforce the law against native protestors (as part of the ipperwash inquiry) ... the idea being that it's now the fed's problem. but of course, the fed can't enforce anything for the same reason (although i don't think there is a written policy of non-intervention like the opp have).

more recently, in ontario, we've started just paying them to stop. the caledonia protests basically ended after the province paid out $20mil rather than enforce removals. lately that protest has been regrowing though.

&gt; i'm thinking back to when there were railway blockades.

quite literally the same conflict surrounding a natural gas pipeline in wetsuweten.

recent leadership troubles have tarnished what was otherwise a respectable party unfortunately, but a few months doesn't take away what the green party has meant to the public discourse on climate action for the past decade or so.",liberals
