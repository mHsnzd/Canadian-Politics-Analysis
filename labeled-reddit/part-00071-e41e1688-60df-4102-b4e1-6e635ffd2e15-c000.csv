i asked you for your meaning of “merit”, and “ethics and morals” was essentially all you wrote. if there are other things that count for you, i’m not going to know what they are unless you tell me.

&gt;again no. his ethics and morality would be known inside the party and by trudeau before he was appointed.

then his position *was* achieved through merit? i get that you disagree with the ethics and morals of the liberals, but if that’s what “merit” means, and lametti was appointed with that being known, then your entire initial point was incorrect—he achieved his position through merit, just not the type of merit that you agree with.

&gt;i was actually a card carrying liberal party member until just after trudeau was elected party leader. you are correct i don't like what the liberals have become under trudeau's leadership.

i meet so many right-wingers on reddit who claim that they were liberals before trudeau. it’s quite something.

&gt;the two issues are related. he was appointed to be a yes man for trudeau, and we are seeing that play out over time.

sure. normally, ministers are blatantly insubordinate of the pm and actively work against their own party, which is totally where lametti is different.

&gt;your free to make your own moral and ethical judgements. if liberal appoints like our justice minister and crtc chair ian scott don't bother you then by all means continue to vote liberal.

i will, but my moral/ethical judgements or who i will vote for has nothing to do with this discussion. you’re claiming superior morality, in your contention that lametti's appointment lacked merit, but then baulking on what that’s supposed to be. by what “merit” do you claim that for yourself?

&gt;on high profile issues it's hard to say you weren't involved as the minister in charge unless he recused himself from a specific issue due to conflict of interest.

i made two points there. one was that the ethical/moral blameworthiness of various people and actions in respect of snc-lavalin, we charity, and these judicial appointments are disputed. that any of these actually were ethical lapses or, if they were, the degree of blameworthiness that attaches, and to whom it attaches, is disputed.

the other point has to do with the involvement of david lametti. is it now your claim that he was “the minister in charge” of snc-lavalin (even though jody wilson-raybould was justice minister at the time) and that we charity was selected by the department of justice (and not bill morneau)?",liberals

2) before running for leader, mackay made a comment that scheer's pro-life views were a \"stinking albatross\" holding the party down. this pissed off many social conservatives.

5) mackay released a pretty vague platform on his website that made him look unprepared, compared with o'toole who put out a 50 page document with a lot of details on his plans.

6) apparently (i'm just repeating something i heard /u/acesolid, a québécois conservative, say) o'toole went out of his way to appeal to quebec nationalists and got an endorsement from gérard deltell (a former leader of the caq that's now a tory mp). mackay didn't try very hard in that province. the cpc has a voting system that gives more weight to quebec members, and that clinched the win.",conservatives

i feel like every time a national tragedy is uncovered (especially our nation's well-documented neglect and mistreatment of the indigenous community), the country bands together to demand a statement from politicians. while some indigenous communities have actually been without clean drinking water for the better part of the last decade, nothing has changed.

all that to say: when we demand an 'act' from the government - like cancelling canada day - it simply buys the government more time to ignore real problems. for instance, we have demanded that the government apologize for xenophobic rhetoric, poor fiscal policies, etc. after we get an apology, what happens? nothing! it really seems like they apologize to appease the masses. whereas, if they fail to apologize, people will continue to press them for answers.

this is why i say that cancelling canada day is a bad idea. if we cancel canada day, that is one more day where the government does not have to address the number of atrocities in our country. something that seems so symbolic - a day of canadian pride - will quickly turn into a day that creates more division, and a day that the government can evade public scrutiny. instead of, \"i can't believe indigenous communities are without drinking water, in 2021,\" we will hear, \"how noble of the canadian government to recognize that it should not be celebrated.\" i say, instead, we have canada day, and those damn journalists that praise trudeau and other mps at every conference press them, continuously, about divisive issues.

however you feel about cancelling canada day, white guilt is not the best place to start the conversation. we know how that goes. some white people will clamour over one another to make symbolic gestures to prove they are the good ones, while others will double down on defiance. \"how dare they speak ill of my country - we invented ~~penicillin~~ insulin for chrissakes, haven't those people seen a heritage minute?\"

a better way to start is to ask: \"what do first nations people want?\" you know, the actual people living in canada whose representatives are presently negotiating numerous treaties with the crown. there is unceded first nations land [all around the country](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/world/canada/canada-first-nations-algonquin-land-claims.html), and the reconciliation process is backed up. your elected officials right now probably assume that you do not care very much about this issue. sure, canadians want harper or trudeau to come out with official apologies, but they don't want a commitment of actual resources. and if something as precious as say, [a golf course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oka_crisis), is at stake, god forbid. say what you will of jacques [parizeau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ealzjnaetg0&amp;ab_channel=wynnson3) and [mike harris](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/irate-harris-wanted-indians-out-of-the-park/article1131320/), they were politicians that understood what voters wanted and it sure wasn't reconciliation.

canada should devote the resources necessary to reconcile. where the canadian state has breached treaties, or where un-ceded land has been occupied, compensation is due. that isn't about white guilt, it's about respecting the basic concept of how contracts work. it is also in the national interest of canada. fundamentally, we are failing to offer indigenous canadians the same ability to flourish inside canada that we offer others. a [third of our prison population](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/22/one-third-canada-prisoners-indigenous-report) is indigenous, and there are significant [socio-economic gaps](https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1602010609492/1602010631711#chp6) between indigenous and non-indigenous people that represent a waste of talent and deeper prejudices. when canada calls out others on issues of human rights [they point out the hypocrisy](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/22/china-canada-relations-xinjiang-human-rights) (yes, it's whataboutism, but we should do better). many of canada's own territorial claims - particularly in the north - are rooted in [indigenous rights](https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/canadian-inuit-challenge-u-s-stance-on-northwest-passage/). and though i put it last, it is important for all of us that we have a country we can all celebrate without second thoughts.

(that's a survey of over 10,000 people before and after each election, that not only asks people who they voted for, but also for their opinions on dozens of political issues, to figure out why they voted they way they did).

he simulates an alternate scenario where doug ford, instead of the 27% approval rating he actually had in oct 2019, had double that (54%), and finds that ford's unpopularity cost the conservatives 3.5% in the popular vote in ontario, and about 5-10 seats. not enough to win the election, but it would have been a lot closer.

next, he looks at the snc-lavalin scandal, and estimates that it tanked government approval enough to cost them 5 percentage points, enough to make the difference between majority and minority.

of course, these are really rough estimates, but i think it's a good sign that scandals and poor decisions still have a measurable impact in election results. i don't think it's healthy for democracy when things are so polarized that no one will change their mind no matter what a person in power does.",conservatives

part of the reason for these challenges is that the federal government is, in fact, taking a much more involved role in the regulation of provincial matters than it has historically. the history of the constitution act, 1867 is one of expansion, so that’s not really a surprise, but the difference here is that the problems trudeau is trying to address are far more expansive than they have been historically. the environment is impossible to confine to 91 or 92 because it touches on every facet of our lives. the concern for the provinces, however, is that allowing the federal government to step in narrows the scope of provincial authority. that’s why the provinces should be doing what they’re doing. even if you agree with trudeau’s changes (like quebec with the carbon tax), it’s important to test their validity, otherwise your risk a permanent expansion of federal power in a way that could be a net negative for local life. in some ways, we’re getting to those outer boundaries.",liberals

what i will say is that in almost all cases, the progressive desire on covid is pretty much for more restrictions. which creates this weird situation where progressives hate ford, but then demand he interfere in their lives *more*. before covid, one might have suspected with good reason that conservatives would have been the covid hawks, and progressives the ones fighting restrictions as is usually the case, but it turned out to be the exact opposite. there's always a limit as to how much interference the government should take, and in each case i'd say ford erred far closer to the progressive ideal than the conservative one. and yet progressives think he did a bad job, while conservatives think he did a worse one yet will still end up voting for him because we have no alternative. it's just weird is all.  


also, i think progressives are constantly comparing him to an ideal in their heads, but not to a practical political reality. viewing the data and comparing us to our neighbours you'd have to conclude ontario did a reasonable job, as every jurisdiction bordering us has done way worse with covid in terms of deaths and cases. i think a lot of progressives want to compare us to new zealand or australia but that's not realistic.",conservatives

i cant comment on nurses doctors or pilots but if both engineers and carpenters always followed the rules no one would be worrying about shoddy construction work in new homes.  lawyers break th rules all the time but their system is set up where someone who also knows the rules is standing 20 feet away yelling objection every time it happens and the system is set up to quickly move on after a rule is broken.

again it wasn't the minister who did anything wrong it isn't even specified he knew about it.  that said part of the issue is under trudeau the ministers are responsible for what their aids do.  this is different from how it happened under harper where the ministers were generally right but the staffers were perceived as doing the wrong stuff and they were the ones blamed.",liberals

in the last two years since jason kenney came into power, i have experienced increasing difficulty in accessing healthcare due to his cuts. and to be frank, i'm one of the least affected by it. i live with 4 other people who, like me, cannot afford anything else because they literally cannot work, being denied access to the services they need.  two have doctors that left the province because of the cuts and they haven't been able to find a family doctor taking patients in our area yet. and while all of them should qualify for ahs, none of them do because kenney made it nigh impossible to get on it.

meanwhile the ucp slashed corporate taxes saying that it will bring in jobs.....it didn't. they gave billions to oil companies who then laid off a ton of workers. kenney has literally lost more money than it would cost to keep our healthcare.

i get that we can't give away free money to everyone, but it too much to ask to not have to live in shitty housing and still stress about paying the rent? to be able to buy decent food, be able to focus on getting better, and not have to live in stress on top of my mental issues?

referrals are already not where they need to be, whoever wrote the policy was ideologically driven and either doesn't understand or care about the medical system. they injected ideology somewhere it doesn't belong and would out-the-gate damage one of our most important infrastructures, which is exactly what you'd expect/fear them to do.

anyway, the more i learned about this scandal the more it seems like a mountain out of a molehill, with the dual status of moj and ag creating differing opinions of what was appropriate for a pm to expect of this person.  jwr said that no lawbreaking happened, and the description of the \"pressure\" from trudeau seemed pretty tame compared to the way others have tried to characterize it (and apparently how she is trying to characterize it now).  i also actually found myself thinking trudeau's take--that snc-lavelin should get a dpa--was the more reasonable one given the circumstances.

this is all also very instructive about politics vs morals/ethics: trudeau thought he was doing something good by putting more women into cabinet.  but by appointing people to promote an equality agenda/virtue signal/whatever you want to call it instead of promoting loyalists, it backfired on him.  just goes to show why politics tends to be so corrupt and ruthless.",liberals

to be clear: i don't have a problem with people not wanting to wear masks or get vaccines. it's a personal choice. but i also don't have any issues with the government mandating safeguards in the middle of a global medical emergency. 

the conservatives tend to be mixed on vaccines/lockdowns as a party (aka membership). but o'toole is striking a balance i'd say. 

another difference between the cpc and ppc is that a majority in the ppc don't believe that covid-19 is real; therefore it's easier to claim that masks, lockdowns, vaccines, etc are draconian and something that the government is using to take over. i assume that maxime also thinks that covid-19 isn't real or isn't that bad. but i wouldn't be surprised is he were just going along to keep that crowd happy.",conservatives

they did, though. duplessis was immensely popular at the time,winning over 50% of the vote especially among rural francophone catholics, who are still the majority in quebec. anglophones and immigrant voted massively liberal (as they  still do).

duplessis overt and popular abuse of jahovah's witnesses are extremely pertinent here because it was precisely for this reason that trudeau brough in the charter of rights, so that petty autocrats like duplessis couldn't viuolate human rights. now legault is doing exactly by invoking the notwithstanding to supend the charter of rights. legault, like duplessis, has too much arbitrary power. 

\\&gt; even if there’s more catholics in québec than there’s people from other religions, they’re still a minority. « the separation of religion and state» happened

there is no separation of church and state in quebec, especially  when people like duplessis and legault can arbitrarily discriminate against religious minorities by suspending their charter rights. there is absolutely nothing there to stop a premier from doing what he wants in quebec as lonmg as they can use the notwithstanding clause to suspend fundamental human rights.

\\&gt; but qcers still wear scars from what happened under duplessis.

the logical thing to do would be to abolish the notwithstanding clause so that premier and national assembly can never do what they did to any quebecers again. the problem here is that duplessis had too much power and could arbitrarily impose his religious views on people through the apparatus of the state. it's not jews, muslim women, and sikhs that are going to hurt quebecers with their religion. they will always be a small minority in quebec as they have always been. their hijabs, turbans, and kippahs hurt no one. they should not be punished for wearing them. they justy want to be able to practive their reiligion without harrassment.",liberals

1) it treats europe as the default and w. europe in particular the default. north america and pacific rim economically advanced democracies also exist. western europe has the biggest welfare states amoung the group so if that's you're default you'll get a skewed impression.

2) political spectrums vary from issue to issue. north america is firmly to the left of europe on immigration for example.

3) the united states alone is the size of w. europe, and about a quarter to a third of the population of economically advanced democracies (depending on who you include in that sample). so you can't treat it as a weird outlier amoung democracies when its such a large portion of the sample to begin with.

not that much as a rule. businesses are incentivized by saving - when they buy new equipment they're already going to look at the most energy efficient models available at the time no matter what - it's not like gas is cheap to start with. but to actually replace good working equipment with something new is a cost they won't generally bear - they pass the extra costs along. it makes it worth spending slightly more on energy efficency when they are buying new but really there's not much in the way of options there right now.  right now there's no replacement for a diesel engine for a long haul, or forestry, etc. so - it's not like they can do anything about it. 

&gt;i've also never understood the argument that it gets passed onto consumers. everything gets passed onto consumers. the companies most efficient at dealing with it get to undercut the other businesses and get more business.

this is not complex. the businesses are already mostly efficient. so if they are taxed more they can't do anything but pass it to the consumer who will pay it. businesses that manage to be slightly more efficient just pocket the extra, it's not going to be a lot. 

have you seen food prices in the last few years? they've risen dramatically. 

think about it - how does a farmer reduce his energy costs? there are no practical 'electric combines' yet and with battery costs if there were they would cost a fortune. the fields still need to be harvested. they going to go back to doing it by hand or something? so - it's just extra cost. that should be pretty simple to see. 

&gt;i do get that it is less elastic than expected and somethings people just need to spend on and will save money elsewhere but the huge number of city folk i know driving big trucks who don't need them suggests the incentive could be stronger.

it just doesn't work that way. bc proved that - they thought the tax would cut emissions by about 30 percent - instead the reality has been that they've only slowed the growth of the increase by about 5 percent. the theory does not match the reality. 

&gt;possibly it should just be applied at high levels in certain areas (gas stations, home heating, luxury products) and lower at other areas (farming, some manufacturing.)

well first off it doesn't do much good there - but second off even by the models we know don't work that would not reduce emissions significantly and certainly no where near what we need. 

it's just ineffective as hell - and it inevitably just becomes a tax the gov't uses that's socially acceptable. bc's tax was supposed to be revenue neutral and it was for about 4 years. now it's just going into general revenues and is not neutral at all. which is what will always happen.

snowden did not plan to end up in russia. he was going to ecuador on a route to avoid countries with us extradition. this is logical. he had a temporary ecuadorian travel visa. while his plane was in the air, the us cancelled his passport and ecuador cancelled his visa. this meant that when he landed in moscow, he had nowhere to go, as no airline would let him board. it was the us, not snowden, that decided he would stay in russia.

when alberta was designing its climate policy, preventing \"carbon leakage\" was a major goal. they used output-based allocations (obas) to do this - it's basically a subsidy to industry, with the money coming from the carbon tax revenue in each sector (cement, oil production, etc.), and distributed based on output. it's like the way the federal carbon tax is divided up and returned to households. the net effect is that dirtier (more carbon-intensive) firms in each sector end up subsidizing the cleaner (less carbon-intensive) ones. average profitability of the sector remains the same.

you may disagree with the arguments, but it is a lie to say that the article does not make an argument for how harper's actions have lead us here. here are some quotes from the article in case you missed them:

**old stock canadians:**
&gt;...harper’s studied use of the combustible phrase “old-stock canadians” at a leaders’ debate during the 2015 election campaign.

&gt;...

&gt;...harper’s cynical, parochial intentions were plain: appeal to his largely white, christian base while feeding a stubborn, malevolent undercurrent that only “old-stock canadians” were bonafide canadians.

**barbaric practices tip line:**
&gt;...harper later dispensed with the calibrated code and vowed to ban public servants from wearing hijabs and set up a tip line so presumably “old-stock canadians” could snitch to the federal police on “new” but not true canadians...

**nccm:**
&gt;the prime minister’s then director of communications called the nccm, in effect, a hive of hamas-supporting terrorists.

&gt;“we will not take seriously criticism from an organisation with documented ties to a terrorist organisation such as hamas,” jason macdonald said... the nccm sued both [stephan harper and jason macdonald] for defamation.

&gt;in 2017, the nccm prevailed, winning a resounding and historic legal victory that required the prime minister’s former chief spokesperson to disavow publicly his defamatory remarks against the council...

&gt;...

&gt;at the eleventh hour, citing its imaginary “adversarial tone,” the royal canadian mounted police pulled its support for a booklet produced by the nccm and another canadian muslim association aimed at preventing the radicalisation of teenagers into kalashnikov-wielding or pick-up-truck-driving terrorists.

**moving on to andrew sheer:***
&gt;rather, scheer embraced harper’s appalling factional instincts and openly solicited the support of avowed bigots and xenophobes who prefer a canada stocked with “old-stock” christian canadians as an intolerant path back to the prime minister’s office.

**m104:**
&gt;scheer announced in a facebook post that he would vote against [m104] on the grounds that it would stifle “free speech and legitimate criticism” and that “it singles out just one faith”.

&gt;it was, of course, a sorry, disingenuous burlesque meant to disguise an embedded strain of islamophobia that has, for a long time, been tolerated and promoted within the conservative party and that represents a growing, not-so-fringe opinion in canada.

**moving on to erin o'toole:**
&gt;...erin o’toole, quickly channelled his predecessors’ penchant for peddling fear, distrust and resentment when he released a video last june asking viewers to “join the fight to take back canada”.

&gt;...

&gt;...his loaded language was reminiscent not only of harper’s “old-stock canadians” line but donald trump’s incoherent-with-rage rants that america had to be rescued from mexican rapists and immigrants from “shit-hole” countries.

**the conclusion to the article:**
&gt;...o’toole, scheer and harper have, by their pernicious words and deeds, helped fuel the islamophobia they claim to abhor.

the internet and digital media isn't exactly a new mode of information delivery and retrieval, all things delivered in a digital format are in some way or another shaped by conventions and structures from previous information formats. ebooks and blogs didn't reinvent the book or the magazine, podcasts didn't reinvent radio broadcasts, email didn't reinvent lettermail, youtube didn't reinvent tv shows and public access networks. you see these things and think it is a completely new form of information that people are somehow illiterate towards, but these forms of information delivery and retrieval have been around for decades or centuries or millennia.

you can disagree all you want, and continue looking at the world around you like it's some unknown problem that needs fixing, but that is more indicative of your own misunderstanding than it is of your peers information literacy. cultural anthropologists in the subfield of media studies and information studies have been studying digital media since pcs first entered our lexicon. politicians in the west have mandated that computer and digital literacy be included school curriculums since the 90s when the internet became a public resource. social life have been entwined with digital communications since the 2000s. you are part of a minority of viewpoints that think people are somehow unprepared for the very medium they have been using for the past three decades already, so who really needs to be caught up on things in that scenario?",conservatives

h1b6n6d,2021-06-10T04:27:21.000-07:00,"canada has an islamophobia problem — and conservatives are at the root of it there's a couple of answers to this question.

one is that the evangelical christian right are one of israel's biggest supporters (they see an israeli ethnostate as critical for the second coming), so the conservatives in media who court them have a vested interest in benignly neglecting its more extreme elements.

another is that most extreme orthodox jews that are seen in media in the west are white, and most extreme orthodox islamists are brown. it's not perfectly accurate to life, but it doesn't serve media needs to change that picture. even in israel, because of the huge influx of settlers from europe, there is a very large population that (besides of course being ethnically jewish), are easily perceived as \"white\" in comparison to the many arabic jews, christians, and muslims who lived there post-wwi - including people we now describe as \"palestinians\". in many respects, there is an element, especially of secular jews, that has been functionally included in the north american \"liberal\" definition of white. 

i denote \"liberal\" there because there are many on the right, even in more centrist circles, who would never agree with that, and more religious left-wing people who would have the same view but for different reasons. it's a continually tenuous position where jews are \"white when it suits people's arguments\" and not white when it doesn't, in a position similar to the irish in the late 19th and early 20th century. just like then, it's a tool of white supremacy.

finally, orthodox jews have not been the \"bad guy\" of the us wars for the past 30 years in the way arabic muslims have, so they haven't needed to be painted as bad guys by the english-speaking media. and indeed, even as a supporter of palestine i can see how the state of israel garnered an incredible amount of sympathy from the fallout of its initial formation. they (with a giant amount of support from the west) took on basically all comers in a relatively short period to stake their claim. they were the underdog at the time, and transitioned into being an anti-hero. now, of course, they've gone full \"villain with a tragic backstory\".",conservatives

i'm sorry but you're easily confused so it probably seems that way to you. technically we're a constitutional monarchy i suppose but the representation is created by the constitution. so - while we have representation in our democracy the fact is we're a constitutional democracy (well - monarchy but not really).

2. most likely the same situation. there's no reason for the libs to go into coalition with the ndp, and vice versa. the ndp doesn't want to catch itself in a lib dem situation of having to back down on their promises because the liberals are the bigger coalition partner, and the liberals don't want to risk legitimizing the ndp as a legitimate governing party.

&gt;taxes are certainly too high, but they're not too high because corporate taxes are too low, they're high because the government spends too much money and they'll tax people as much as they can get away with without them revolting.

there are certainly areas of corrupt overspending but the cost of things covered by taxes are also increasing, eg healthcare, our biggest cost by far, gets far more expensive as societies age

&gt; the dividend tax advantage is often overstated. for taxable investors who have above-average incomes, it may not make sense to focus on dividends at all.   
&gt;  
&gt; at the highest tax bracket, capital gains are taxed at a *much* lower rate: for income over $132,000, the rate is approximately 23% for capital gains and 30% for dividends. 

we are talking about *trickle down economics*. the fact that low income investors are advantaged with dividend taxation is irrelevant. th concept of trickle down economics is **lowering taxes for the rich** so that the gains trickle down to lower earners. our focus is on how high income earners / high net worth individuals are taxed. 

and as your article clearly states, capital gains is a much more tax efficient strategy than dividends. therefore, stock buybacks fit into the \"trickle down\" narrative, because it's like paying out dividends but at a much lower tax rate.",liberals

i feel like we're starting to get spin that \"oh, it was the harper government's fault that we didn't find these earlier\", it's really just not really true. moreover, it is not a coincidence that the tk’emlups te secwépemc people found them in this sweep.

they knew where the grave was. they knew where to scan. they'd told people. there are dozens of these sites all over our country at residential schools, and probably at least one or two at day school sites. 

it is not the failure of any singular government to act, it is the continual and systemic failure of our governments over the course of the 20th century to do anything about it. then, it was the purposeful efforts of every subsequent government to sweep what happened under the rug and pretend it didn't happen.

that was the system working as designed. in short, the cruelty was the point, and when the cruelty was no longer palatable, the obfuscation was the point. our current government is in court for trying to destroy records from residential schools. we cannot blame someone else. we cannot pass the buck.

[latest update on c-6](https://www.routineproceedings.com/2021/07/15/roundup-the-failure-of-negotiations-is-nonsense/):

&gt; it appears that the lack of seriousness around getting bill c-6, which would ostensibly ban conversion therapy in canada, through the senate has reached its peak, as the government leader in the senate, senator marc gold, claims that negotiations have collapsed and he can’t bring the senate back to deal with it. which is nonsense. he has the power to petition the speaker to recall the chamber, and that request would almost certainly be granted. they can sit as long as necessary to pass the bill, and if they can’t get unanimous consent for hybrid sittings, well, by now most if not all senators should be double-vaxxed and can attend in person. there are no actual impediments to them actually doing this.
&gt; 
&gt; part of the problem is gold himself – he doesn’t seem to grasp how the senate works procedurally, and that he has a lot more power than he claims to. he also, for no good reason, proposed a date for the senate to rise at the end of june when he could have kept it sitting into july with no actual problem. he also seems to be enamoured with the idea of agreeing on a timeline to pass the bill, which he doesn’t need, but ever since the senate agreed to timelines around some major pieces of legislation in the previous parliament, there is a romance with doing this all the time in the senate, which is unnecessary and in some cases counter-productive.
&gt; 
&gt; the other part of the problem is justin trudeau. and while it has been suggested that he has ordered gold to let the bill die so that he can use it as a wedge in the election – frankly, the dynamics in the senate don’t really support this line of reasoning – it’s more that trudeau has a case of not-so-benign neglect when it comes to the senate. by cutting it loose, so to speak, he gives it no mind rather than making it part of his strategy. there’s no reason why gold is not a cabinet minister who can answer for the government in the chamber, rather than his current half-pregnant quasi-governmental role while still claiming independence, which doesn’t work in theory or practice. he clearly needs the support of pco because he’s not able to do a reasonable enough job as it stands with what support he does get, and there frankly needs to be an actual government (meaning cabinet) voice in the chamber. but in insisting on “senate independence,” trudeau simply expects things to go through the chamber and he can forget about it, which is a mistake.",liberals

edit: good study. thanks for the link.

&gt; people get attached to the place they are raised and many don't like to see it changing too quickly.

i think humans’ discomfort with change predates our civilization - that is, i think it is more or less hardwired and dates back to some non-human ancestor. prey animals (as we were in the wild) need to be suspicious of things that are different because they might be dangerous. we don’t really need this mechanism in the same way, but we still like things to remain more or less the same. 

the problem is that in modern human society things never remain the same. everything changes all of the time. so unless we just want to be uncomfortable all the time we need to use more recent parts of our brain, along with our education, to determine whether or not something new that feels like a threat is truly a threat. most of the time the answer is no.

&gt;they also don't like their homes being constantly insulted. it makes them feel they themselves are under attack.

in some places zoning makes building and density impossible. in others the red tape costs make it unprofitable to build anything but specific units.

zoning and red tape force developers to focus on big and profitable builds because its an expensive and risky business.

if there is one thing we've learned from the pandemic (depending on the situation) there are essential services and then there are essential  services. 

keeping the government running and making sure programs rolled out and support was available to canadians was essential. making sure everyone can stand in the house of commons and repeat the same sounds bites during question period (sorry i have a low option of it because i have to watch it everyday), is only essential.

should they have come back sooner? yes i agree, unfortunately if i remember correctly there was politic-ing going on (conservatives didn't want virtual meetings) and the tech was quite there with either the translation or secure voting... i forget lol",conservatives
