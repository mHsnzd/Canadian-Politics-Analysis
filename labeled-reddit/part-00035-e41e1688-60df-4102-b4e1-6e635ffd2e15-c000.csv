it's not a great play. he's trying to appeal to everyone, not realizing that with each flip flop he's just losing the confidence of voters. i hope this attempt at coming to power fails. not only to protect our healthcare, cbc, and women's reproductive rights, but to let other politicians know that you can't just lie yourself into power.",conservatives

these are the rules well known about in advance.  
to be invited to take part in the debates, a political party must meet at least one of the three requirements:

1. be represented in the house of commons by someone initially elected under the party banner

2. a party's candidates had to receive at least four per cent of the number of valid votes cast in the 2019 election

3. public opinion polls taken five days after the election is called show national support of at least 4 per cent.

the ppc failed all of them, so why should they be taken seriously at the debates.  they're in the same category on this list as the marxist-leninists.  society shouldn't treat all opinion's equally, and the ppc have shown that most canadians don't want to waste their time on listening to them.  i for one would like to see the problems that bernier would cause for o'toole.",conservatives

1. hard drugs benefit the elite, because drugs make sure poor people never succeed and challenge the elite's position. legal guns threaten the elite by breaking up the monopoly on violence.
2. abortion has saved many people from starting a family. family is the biggest enemy of the state, because it is a competing support network. mandatory vaccination teaches you to comply which puts the state in a better position.
3. equity programs just move the decision center to equity review boards. it is not about who gets the position, but who decides who should get the position. it does not cut off the straight-white-male path to success, just look at justin trudeau - he made it pretty far in life despite positive discrimination. as long as your political allegiance is where it should be, you'll be fine.
4. you misunderstand what freedom of press means. it is not the freedom from the state, it is freedom from the consumers. so cbc, pbs, russia today are an example of the free press - they can say whatever without having to pander to the consumer. that's why this kind of media likes to lecture you from a high horse position because what are you gonna do - unsubscribe? lol

the throne speech is more the mandate set by the government and agreed upon by parliamentarians. parliamentarians are ultimately the representatives that were voted in and by extension are still reflecting the voices of the region they represent, and they’re most certainly responding to issues based on pressures in their constituency. that said, covid still represents a significant shift in the landscape and the argument could be made that the question of the direction of the recovery could be placed back to the electorate.

i don’t think we could have asked for a better makeup of parliament during the pandemic personally and don’t really want to see it change anytime soon. with 3 parties holding the balance of power, it allows the will of the electorate to be more fluid instead of operating from a single point of view and encourages consensus building which generally leads to more robust policy.",liberals

paving over the greenbelt also doesn't address the massive infrastructure costs that governments have to incur to make certain areas developable.  there's no infinite supply of land.  at some point, land becomes scarce, and when you have a speculative frenzy, global capital and cheap credit converging on a finite supply of land, bubbles will ensue.

access to abortion in canada is far, far, *far*, more legally precarious that you seem to think it is. currently no there are no laws regarding abortion access at the federal level ever since r v. morgentaler. legally it's just another medical procedure, no different than an appendectomy.

however, r v. morgentaler did not find that canadian women have a right to an abortion. it found that the laws that existed at the time violated section 7 of the charter in a way that was not justified under section 1. the supreme court left the door open for new legislation to be put in place but mulroney just couldn't get anything passed. chretien, martin, and harper all chose not to touch it and so the status quo of no restrictions endured. new restrictions can be put in place at any time so long as they are within the constraints of s.7 or justifiable under s.1.

admittedly, it's unlikely you'd be able to thread that particular needle outside of things like gutting funding for abortions or the imposition of barriers to access. (both of which are still legitimate threats to abortion access.)

the real threat is the notwithstanding clause. a conservative majority could criminalize abortion across canada outright using section 33 right out of the gate. now, i don't think they'd go that far but the point is that there is nothing in canadian law or the charter that protects accessibility to abortion from a sufficiently motivated government.

for example, it's completely possible that the actual vaccine contracts the government signed specified something like an april start date-- a date that was chosen not because the government is incompetent or made a mistake, but because when it was signed it was believed that it would take until march (for example) for the vaccines to finish phase 3 trials and get approved. the reason they were able to complete the trials quicker is that the us went from around 40,000 cases per day in august to over 100k per day at the start of november. another wave might have been expected, but i don't think anyone thought that trump would completely give up on fighting covid and just let the situation spiral. especially not when it had become *the* issue of the campaign. 

so in this sense it's possible for a policy to fail not because of anything that can truly be blamed on the actions, or inactions, of the government, but rather the fact that we always work with incomplete information.",liberals

the globe and mail’s breaking of the story behind the trudeau administration’s decision to depend on china for our vaccines unmasked the utter naïveté of this government. while telling canadians in may of 2020 that this country had made all necessary arrangements with pfizer and moderna, the prime minister had actually contracted with cansino, a chinese company controlled by the chinese communist party. and he did this at a time of conflict with china over china holding two canadians hostage going on two years while canada has kept a huawei executive in detention. she happens to be a relative of a senior member of the chinese politburo. within a month of the deal, the chinese government ordered cansino to stop all production for and shipment to canada.

where was our prime minister’s intuitive sense so necessary for a leader’s primary obligation of protecting his citizens in peace and in war. contracting with a tyranny is bad enough. dealing with that tyranny at a time of conflict is worse. and lying to the canadian people is worst of all. the globe even uncovered pmo emails discussing how to keep all this from canadians. the prime minister’s crush on china has been known for years but this was worse than even his comment that he “admires the efficiency of the chinese regime.”

j.j. mccullough writing in the washington post made the point that, “canadians are not being vaccinated in low numbers because they’re somehow too egalitarian or polite to take their shots until everyone is guaranteed one. nor, for that matter, can one cite any evidence suggesting the country is teeming with anti-vaccine advocates or some other widespread movement of resistance. no, canadians sit in 38th place simply because their government has not obtained enough vials of serum to inject them with. canadians have a clear target for their outrage.” the article was subtitled, “the responsibility lies with justin trudeau.”",liberals

bc has a long history of foreign elements using loopholes created by the government. in the past it has been the chinese gangs washing money in casinos and running birth tourism rackets with the support of the bc liberals.

if i was a rich foreigner who wanted to avoid the foreign buyer and speculation tax, i would reach out to someone with a birth certificate (like a birth tourist), and have them register a numbered llc to purchase one property with cash. i then 'rent' it out to the tourist, or put it on air bnb. our current way of tracking can not discern these types of purchases from regular ones.

my point is that just because the tax didn't fix the market, doesn't mean that foreign speculators aren't taking advantage of market conditions, just that they have changed tactics. we can only build so many homes and condos in a year. even if we relaxed zoning, and removed nimby, canadian housing is still an attractive investment mechanism both within and outside canada. this needs to change so that canadians only compete with canadians.",liberals

for example, in the rural areas in the most southern part of quebec, south-east of montreal (towards sherbrooke), the cpc gets only 5-15% of the vote, and most people vote bloc or liberal.  same thing in the rural regions north-west from montreal.

lots of people feeling there’s a lot out of their control right now...  hence disenfranchisement in life (job issues, mental pressures, stagnation and inflation, mobility issues, new technologies which are leaving many behind, etc).   

it’s been happening for a while to a good deal of people (education shifts, dot.com crash, 2008 crash, covid crash, property unaffordabilty)... but there weren’t many outlets to make such people feel like they could say “stop, i’m going to now exercise some semblance of control for myself”, or a *franchisement* of control. 

perhaps one of first such instances of trying to self-empower in the earlier days of the start of this new sentiment of disenfranchisement was the occupy wall street movement.  then came trump in the us which gave another outlet to people who felt they could overtly exercise some type of recapturing of control through their version of fighting back.  

and now in our election, it fell right on the heels of covid which has given swaths of the canadian population this sentiment of disenfranchisement from directing and controlling their own life events.  protesting covid measures was a way to feel some type of self empowerment (self-enfranchisement) when they may have mentally needed that boost.  

and now the election is the outlet for some people to try to feel their taking control by taking action into their own hands.

i may not agree with their tactics or political alignments, but i feel for so many people who are out there hurting to the point that they feel they need to do this to re-franchise their lives.",liberals

&gt; the ace in harper's pocket was his gradual journey from opposition leader to minority pm to majority pm. every step of the way, people could be frightened away by stories of harper's 'hidden agenda'. but by 2011, he had developed enough of a record of relatively moderate governance that he could say, 'what hidden agenda?' and get the 905 to believe him.

i think those two things speak to why o'toole's circumstances are just so different from harper's.

the third element is the difference in personality and temperament. harper could play beatles songs on the piano and pose with kittens, but he was also a *ruthless* son-of-a-bitch where it counted. o'toole is neither of those things. at least 2021-model o'toole isn't.",conservatives

the 5.5 billion number was construction + 30 years of operating cost and maintenance.

capital costs were estimated at 2.8 billion, liuna’s review put the construction estimates at 3.5 billion (where i got my number from). 

the province then asked the feds for 1.5 billion to fund the project — which they got (and some) today. in addition, the city of hamilton will be the one to cover operating costs (aka the 3 billion over 30 years the province didn’t want to be on the hook for).

\"underscoring this campaign is the belief that we should not be having a federal election during the pandemic, a feeling shared by 69% of canadians, up a remarkable 13 points since the outset of the election. even 60% of liberal voters hold this point of view. moreover, a sense of apathy is strong: nearly half (46%) of canadians agree (13% strongly/34% somewhat) that they don’t really like any of the parties in this election, up 11 points since the start of the campaign, and another factor which could contribute to lower turnout.\"

also 47% of liberal voters are open to voting the ndp, the highest of any second choice for the other parties. by comparison, 32% of ndp voters have liberals as their second choice/willing to switch. strategic voting seems to be bolstering the liberals right now.

turnout is definitely a huge factor this election.",liberals

the real question is what proportion of those votes come from the tories and what proportion are from the other parties or who didn't vote at all. judging by those margins it seems like a huge portion of support doesn't actually come from the cpc so if this is accurate we could see some unexpected results.

i'm going to give my home riding a proper write up tomorrow but in windsor-tecumseh i think the ndp have the advantage. last time around the ndp incumbent (who is running again this time) lost by a nosehair in the home stretch because an audio tape leaked of her calling her constituents \"rubes\" after she lost a mayoral race. this is one of the few ridings where the ndp probably have an organizational advantage and the liberals don't seem to be pushing as hard for windsor west as they did last time so i'd guess that makes the difference (plus less urgency to stop the tories)",liberals

&gt;  
&gt;**“if canada can successfully implement all of these announced plans, it would go a long way to closing the ambition gap and its rating would improve to ‘almost sufficient,’” according to the tracker.**

&gt;“everything we've seen so far from the liberals is that they do not follow through on their promises,” she said. “we have seen them make commitments over the past six years to take climate action, and then do the opposite.”

tbh this ndp critic's line of attack seems strange, because while liberals have abandoned some of their promises in other areas (e.g. electoral reform), they've actually been pretty consistent about implementing the major climate policies they promised, like carbon pricing, coal-phaseout, revising the environmental assessment process, etc.

and overall they've actually gone a lot further than what they promised back in 2015, the prime example being that there's a nationwide carbon pricing system, and it's ramping up to $170/tonne by 2030.  the investments in electric vehicles (including rebates, charging stations and deals for automakers to manufacture evs in canada) are also a big deal, and weren't even something they originally promised.

- highly recommended
- recommended 
- not recommended 

or at least this has been through chrétien and martin and since trudeau took over (and undid harper’s changes, who was upset because not enough of his patronage candidates were ending up in the “highly recommended” pile so removed it, just leaving the recommended and not recommended, trudeau put it back in 2016)

the cabinet ministers then review the two recommended piles, the justice minister presents each candidates resume focusing on the “short list” (“highly recommended”). then they vote, with the justice minster and prime minister being the key votes. the name of the successful candidate is then publicly announced and taken by the prime minister to the governor general to make the arrangements for the appointment ceremony. &lt;- we are here

then, depending on the level of court, they are sent to judge school, which is run by judges, retired judges and particularly distinguished law professors who are absolute experts in certain areas (usually the author of the most cited law textbook in the area, like peter hogg did it for constitutional).  for the supreme court it’s mostly just self-study and being taught by fellow scc justices/retired justices though.",liberals

gvljvh3,2021-04-23T04:56:39.000-07:00,"judge rules key federal sex work laws unconstitutional &gt;how do you get that? making sex work safer, and eventually one hopes regulated, makes sex trafficking less likely

for those that choose to be there. that's what this is about. if the woman is willingly entering the trade, this kind of legislation works for them because they have full agency and control as an entrepreneur. 

it doesn't apply when when the woman is being held against her will. attempts to run away or get help result in physical, sexual, emotional or psychological abuse. it's well documented how these women are trained to avoid contacting police, and gta law enforcement has had issues reaching out to these women because of the control exerted by traffickers. they're taught to fear the police or social services. regulation doesn't do anything for them in that situation since they have no agency. trafficking rings are also not employers that can be held against labour standards. they're criminal enterprises. working conditions don't apply to them the way they would to labour traffickers who are exploited by the construction industry for example.  

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; sure, but why are you saying the judge is opposed to this? the courts don't have the power to create this framework. 

i'm not sure how familiar you are with the background on these types of cases so i'll give you a quick recap for context. during the earlier days of the harper government, a legal change was introduced to follow the nordic model - selling sex was legal, but buying it wasn't. a lot of people weren't aware of the law, even now, and assume canada continues to criminalize prostitution, but that hasn't been the case for about a decade and a half now. i've posted the relevant legislation from the criminal code elsewhere in the thread.

a sex worker lobby was formed in partnership with a couple of law professors i believe from york university after the new legislation was enacted that was advocating for full legalization. the law has a sunset clause that requires parliament to review and renew it. trudeau has long wanted to support the lobby for the optics that the liberal party supports feminism and women's rights, so there has been pressure on his government to fully do away with the law when it comes time for review.

court rulings are part of the strategy the lobby has been using to attack the legislation from different angles, so if they find sympathetic judges they could use the legal foundation of striking down parts of the law to fully get to legalization. 

what i'm pointing out in the thread is that we're only getting the one side of the story, and the legal discussion and response, as evidence in the responses here and your comments, only focuses on it as a labour-related question. and that works as long as you are only considering the group that has the agency to enter and leave the industry at will, the lobby. the court rulings also support that.

what's missing is that we're not able to hear from the hidden population that forms the larger base of the population. we can't, they're being hidden and exploited by their pimps and trafficking rings. in striking down parts of the law to open the way for legalization, we're losing the legal protection necessary to stop the trafficking in the first place.

that was why the harper government did the law in the first place - to shift the focus of law enforcement away from criminalizing victims to criminalizing the demand. sex trafficking isn't profitable if no men are buying sex after all. of course, that means the sex worker lobby would be out of work, since their client base is...men. men in marriages and relationships. it's not just single men. i mean through that lens alone i'm not sure anyone here thinks it's a good idea for married men to be purchasing sex services. 

so we have a legal conflict where having the law protects one group and leaves the other no worse off, and removing the law empowers a smaller group but enables the full exploitation of the other. i don't think feminism ever supported enabling one group of women while endorsing exploitation of another. so when a judge strikes down a part of the law, it gets us closer to that space where we as a society are choosing one group over another.",liberals

why don't you grow up and take on real conversations instead of playing thought police.

not sure what's race-baiting about citing a *recent* study *relevant* to the discussion at hand which is about - *checks notes* - police.

what in the world, in your mind, is a \"racial callout\" and how do you imagine that that detracts from the study cited? isn't a racial callout when you call out an individual that's being racist simply to harm their social profile?

apparently police killing black people in toronto is race-baiting and has no relevance as to whether we should take the opinion of police chiefs on gun legislation at face value.
