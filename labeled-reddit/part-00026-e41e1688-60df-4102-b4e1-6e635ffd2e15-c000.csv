&gt;the party tabled a motion in the commons today that condemns \"the government\" for extending the time between shots.

&gt;in fact, it was the national advisory committee on immunization (naci), an independent body composed of volunteer experts, that suggested the length of time between shots be spaced out to allow more canadians to get at least one dose while supplies are limited.

&gt;while naci makes recommendations, it's ultimately up to the provinces and territories to decide how they use the vaccine shots — and how long an interval they require between doses.

&gt;the federal government does not dictate the interval between shots and is not directly involved in the administration of doses outside of correction service canada (csc) facilities, the canadian armed forces and other limited settings.

if o'toole could even attempt to be honest and truthful in his criticism perhaps people would be able to take him more seriously. i've criticized the rollout myself, in various ways, so i can understand why others would too, but they should at least do so honestly. if you have to be disingenuous to get your point across maybe consider the validity of your point and go in another direction that doesn't require you to spread misinformation.",conservatives

if the cpc is willing to impose a $50/t carbon price, i think that's a significant step. o'toole will of course face an uphill battle in selling it to his own party.

capping it at $50/t isn't so good. and how they're using the revenue (tracking how much each person has paid) seems considerably more complicated than just dividing it up equally. but this seems like a big step towards political consensus on carbon pricing.",conservatives

on a very surface level i can see why someone could think this about the recent apologies for actions in wwii, or but really it's a gesture of goodwill and acknowledgement that \"hey, we did some bad things in the past, and we're sorry.\" maybe you could make the argument it's too little, too late, but it's probably not good to just leave it buried forever. this isn't even \"pc culture run amok\" like the last paragraph seems to imply strongly. it doesn't take much to quickly say something respectful and apologize - it's not like these things are bogging up legislation or the government's ability to act. this is such a non-issue.",liberals

&gt;we either pay for the programs or we should cut programs. nobody wants cuts, so the alternative is taxing. sorry to spoil your party, but the piper needs to get paid.

plenty of people want cuts.

no party is being spoiled. your argument changes nothing. if a government party started taxing primary residences they would be gone the next election.

&gt;the right thing is treating all canadians fairly. we currently given a massive tax break to homeowners. the government subsidizes home ownership by underwriting the risk allowing banks to offer low interest since they have no risk.

fairness is a fallacy. home owners pay for cmhc insurance and it is a self funded and managed program. 

the government may backstop it but for the government to be on the hook would take an insane crash. banks offer low rates because of competition and the current rate environment.

banks would love to offer higher rates for their products, they would make more money

&gt;given that our current financial situation will not get a balanced budget ever, the government needs to raise revenues. the question is how do this fairly.

fairly? are you sure you want fair?

the top 20% earns 49.1% of the nation’s income but pays 55.9% of total taxes. that doesn't seem fair.

the bottom 20% earn 4.1% of the nation’s income while collectively paying just 1.8% of all taxes. that certainly seems unfair.

a signiant number of canadians use _more_ services than they pay in tax whilst other canadians pay a lot of tax and are unable to access those services.

that seems unfair.

if you want fairness and to raise taxes then you should be supporting raising taxes on the bottom 45% of income earners.

the second attempt came a few months later, but this time it was a hard pro life bill. abortions would have been entirely banned except to save the mothers life, and any emergency abortion would have to be approved by a single doctor, not an abortion committee like before. it essentially was a nearly identical version of the law that was struck down by the supreme court in 1988. this time mulroney whipped the vote in favor and passed it in the house. however, the bill was rejected by the senate on a tied vote, so it again failed to pass. one of the rare instances in which the senate rejected a bill from the house.

i don't think it's that nifty.  even if he gets some traction on twitter, he's falling into the trap that david cameron warned the british conservatives about: these kidns of positions create the impression that they're the \"nasty and mean\" party.  once that impression starts to stick in people's mind, it colours how they see the tories on everything, even issues they otherwise are sympathetic to the tories with.  moreover, it becomes generational as entire generations grow up thinking the tories are mean.    


suburban dad worried about the deficit and has an autistic son and is worried the tories are mean and will throw him under the bus?  maybe won't vote for them.  there's a lot of soft voters who fall into that category, who have an addicted nephew, an autistic child, a trans aunt, etc. etc. who are going to sour on the tories if they think they're mean.

i cringed when rosie tried to get him on the jurisdictional hurdles he would have in order to fulfill his platform. and while i am aligned with the ndp in wanting a more muscular fed government (which trudeau has been moving to) i felt the ndp has often played on people’s ignorance of prov-fed jurisdiction in selling its policies lately. surely singh himself would be aware of the jurisdictional challenges involved. after that performance though, i’m not even sure that he really is. 

honestly, re: tmx, he should have perhaps drawn a line in the sand and said he’d commit to making it the last oil pipeline canada would build. it’s a position that still differentiates him from trudeau and especially o’toole who’s  pledged to re-open the possibility of northern gateway (or perhaps he’s flip-flopped on that too?).

it's important to remember that ontario is closer between the liberals and tories than last time because the liberals are down, not because the tories are up.

hcxzyi6,2021-09-14T22:47:53.000-07:00,"conservative views on vaccine passports and mask mandates i don't think vaccine passports are that against conservative ideas at all. the majority of conservatives actually support these measures per polling i've seen. it's really only the conspiracy fringe (mostly ppc) which seems to be super anti-vaxx. some of the cpc may be more on the vaccine hesitant but that probably is mostly due to disinformation. there may also be some libertarians who are opposed on principle but are otherwise vaccinated as well.

in canada, we have a public health system. if you are a conservative you probably believe in the concept of personal responsibility. in this case choosing not to get a vaccine greatly increases the chances of you going into a hospital, going on vent, or being left with disability or death. all of which becomes stuff that the taxpayers have to fund at the expense of other services because you chose to make a poor decision. if this was a system like the united states where you suffer the financial consequences of your own behavior maybe i wouldn't care as much. however, i still care about those who actually can't protect themselves like the immunocompromised, who shouldn't be expected to surrender their livelihoods because other people do not want to do their part.

i view vaccine mandates much as the way i view conscription. not fun from a personal liberties stand-point but there are challenges in which sometimes personal liberties must be put aside for the good of the nation whether it be war or a pandemic. it also gives businesses the ability to determine who they serve, which businesses have always had the right to do. some provinces are forcing businesses to enforce vaccine passports others are leaving it up to the discretion of businesses. businesses have legal responsibilities on safe workplaces so in many ways some businesses feels this helps them achieve that. the main objective other than to get people to get vaccinated, is to prevent super spreader events which can overwhelm hospitals if a bunch of unvaccinated people get covid at the same time. the other way to do this is lockdowns but this is far more intrusive imo.

also half the arguments i see about vaccines passports or mandates are that it violates some personal rights. news flash: there is no right to be unvaccinated and there never has been. vaccination status is not and never will be a protected class. in the u.s. for example the 1905 jacobson v. massachusetts is very clear that the state has the ability to enforce compulsory vaccination laws, and it is equally likely that canadian courts will look at this the same way, in fact historically canadian jurisdictions have had very strong mandatory vaccination requirements against diseases like smallpox. i see no reason that people would think there is some legal precedent against vaccination and in fact i don't think the governments have gone as far as they probably legally can in this direction either.

if your a libertarian type then this may see abhorrent do the values of \"personal liberty\" or \"you can't tell me what to do\". however, if you are a nationalist conservative, textualist conservative, fiscal conservative or any other kind of conservative really. there really is nothing against mandatory vaccination/vaccine mandates.",conservatives

i've been voting for more than 2 decades now and i've rarely been able to even consider voting for a major conservative party.
i have a few conservative sympathies, mind you.
i don't know if i would vote for one, but it would be nice to have them as an *option*, at least.

the closest i got was when i lived in calgary and preston manning was my mp.
i disagree(d) with almost all of his policies, as i think he was wrong-headed about the reform party's policies.
but still i found him a very respectable man.
i attended town halls of his.
he was thoughtful and principled and passionate about democracy.
i always voted against him because his policies were so wrong, but at least i could *consider* voting for him.

there were a smattering of other old reformers who i considered respectable.
deb grey and some others from the [drc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democratic_representative_caucus) were decent people if, again, not totally solid on their policies.
but they got pushed out.

some of the old pcs were decent people (like joe clark, who agreed to march in calgary's pride parade when every other alberta politician refused).
but they've been largely pushed out, too.

these days i can only point to one conservative member who i consider to be a respectable and honourable person (michael chong), but he doesn't run in my riding.

every other canadian conservative politician i've seen in the past 10 to 20 years is literally beyond consideration.
so fantastically stupid and evil that i cannot even *consider* thinking about them.

the media keeps saying the party is at a crossroads now.
do you keep patronizing the batshit loony evil world-destroying fanbase, or do you aim for more mainstream conservatives?
by my view, the conservatives were at that crossroads many years ago, and they've consistently chosen to go further and further down the wrong path.
i don't know what they can do to save the party at this point.

that said, the cpc platform is more moderate this time around, but i don't think too many people are really convinced that the cpc as a whole is much more moderate than 2019. i also wonder whether there's a sort of balancing effect on polls from ndp/lpc swing voters who vote ndp if the lpc is leading the polls and lpc if the cpc is leading.",conservatives

there are, unfortunately, outside social (or social media) pressures which act upon individuals, particularly those with multiple behavioural disorders or who are living in unhealthy environments. hence we should not allow young people to rush into permanent, life-and-body altering choices, at an age where (online) peer groups can have excessive influence on an individual's self-image.

i didn’t claim it was. it was passed in the shadow of 9/11. using a tragedy to remove freedom.

&gt;second, government passes hundreds of bills every year. i don't get a say on what is proposed, what is voted on, and what ultimately passes. i only vote in elections once every 4 odd years. this is not a referendum vote. it hasn't even been an issue that was in any way divisive or decisive in recent canadian elections.

if government passes bills that are unpopular what happens to that government? 

&gt;third, in electing a government, we have to balance the various positions of each party. for me, a party with no plan with regard to climate change won't get my vote. thst means of the other party is proposing something that i don't necessarily agree with (like a gun ban), it likely won't weigh in the balance for me.

true, we must choose the platform that is the most beneficial to all canadians, not just ourselves.

&gt;that's all. i know calling redditors low information may get you off, but that's not helpful to your cause. if anything, trying to convince someone they're wro g by telling them they're stupid only reinforces their beliefs, and likely leads to more support for that position.

low information doesn’t mean stupid. i don’t expect you or anyone else to become gun experts. if we had to become experts about every bill, we’d have no time for anything else.

we elect leaders who we hope won’t betray our trust and manipulate us, and it’s clear that the trudeau government is using this tragedy to not only not stop the flow of illicit guns from the usa which were the majority of the guns used in this tragedy, but remove freedoms from canadians who haven’t done anything wrong.

its also a betrayal of the “evidence based legislation” promised by this government, as all the evidence points to illicit trafficked firearms from the usa as the overwhelming majority of shootings.

here's a summary for people just skimming through:

&gt; based on an adult population of 29.5 million in canada, our latest results show 7 percent or 2.1 million adults are hesitant and the same number are outright refusing a covid-19 vaccination.

...

&gt; the hesitant are not conspiracy theorists. they aren’t angry at the world. they don’t think covid-19 is a hoax. they aren’t radicals of the left or the right — 61 percent of them say they are on the centre of the spectrum. two thirds have post-secondary education. they might be timid, but they’re not stupid.

&gt; almost half of them (46 percent) live in ontario and well over half of them (59 percent) are women. a quarter were born outside canada. their average age is 42 and the plurality are between 30 and 44 years old. if they were voting in a federal election today, 35 percent would vote liberal, 25 percent conservative, 17 percent ndp, 9 percent green — pretty similar to overall voting intentions for the entire population.

the article title is shitty, because it hides the fact that the next most significant portion of the vaccine hesitant are conservatives. it implies people who vote liberal are overwhelmingly more likely to be anti-vaxx, and that's not the case from their data.

it doesn't say anything about religious affiliations.

a virus can only spread via the movement of its vector. stop the vector, stop the spread. there is no argument against this and we use border restrictions everyday to combat the spread of diseases in plants and animals. this is not controversial nor is it questionable. i suggest looking at some of the authors and their respective organisations, you’ll find a common political thread (but that’s neither here nor there).

the thing with covid is that it was already spreading before we knew about it. but stopping travel would be the difference between putting out small fires and dealing with the national establishment and spread of the virus. look at new zealand and taiwan. and now that the emerging variants are already showing significant increases in transmission and virulence, we have even little reasons for keeping the borders open to unnecessary international travel.

there was no rationale for telling canadians that covid wasn’t a risk to canadians, don’t worry we learned a lot from sars, don’t wear (or buy) masks, travel restrictions don’t stop the spread of diseases and all the other nonsense we’ve been told. and each time there was a 180 degree change in policy people dismissed it as a normal change based on evolving information, which is what you seem to believe too.

our position on travel didn't evolve, we went ahead with the obvious decision too late to be of any use and only after the rest of the world already put restrictions in place. same with our bizarre admission that the virus was airborne; canadians were told to wash their hands and wear a leaky cotton face covering months after it was established that the virus was indeed airborne and not driven by fomites.

there’s nothing inherently wrong with either system, parliamentary or presidential. but given the circumstances as they are, with us being neighbours to a superpower that constantly exerts an outsized degree of influence over us - sometimes to our benefit, other times to our detriment - our parliamentary system stands as a rather strong bulwark against the pull of america. there’s a strain of thought in canada that basically sees our best bet as being a sort of satellite for the united states, i take the position that we ought to work in tandem with our southern ally on mutual endeavours that benefit both nations on balance with the development of global democracy and stability, but maintain enough autonomy that we carve our own way forward independent of any superpower as a truly sovereign middle power. our system of government is part and parcel of larger set of factors (including our healthcare system, our banking system, our network of international alliances, our culture [loosely defined as it is], etc.) that make this possible and so i want no part in any effort like republicanism that would undermine us as we advance toward greater independence and influence on the world stage. 

if circumstances were different and it was the pull of britain that we had to resist, perhaps my position would be different and i would favour a different  system for canada, but that’s not the reality we live in (at least not anymore). considering current conditions, regionally and beyond, i see more benefits with retaining our parliamentary system (and by extension, the unique bonds that tie us to certain multilateral alliances like the commonwealth and hopefully canzuk) then i see negatives, and conversely, i see plenty more negatives than positives with the path toward a presidential system.",liberals

one follow up question i have is, which taxes are you wanting to see lowered and where to you want government to cut from?

as an example from my left-leaning perspective: i think that corporate, income, and capital gains taxes need to shift to lessen the burden on small companies, the working poor, and start-up companies... maybe even tax incentives that benefit companies using canadian labour (e.g. higher tax on profits, but offset with credits for salary expenses vs. companies using automation or cheap oversees labour, such as call centres, to drive profits) and i would love to see money invested in social programs such as ubi and infrastructure projects for public transportation (local and regional) that would reduce reliance on cars and create construction jobs.

&amp;#x200b;

i fear that tax cuts don't really lead to smaller government in positive ways, but to the privatization of healthcare and education, which ends up being more expensive for individuals than paying via taxes (e.g. as we see in the us).

its because the ndp plan is shit and won't deliver what the ndp claims to be going for. on top of that he looked at the economic cost and saw the ndp plan being *needlessly* expensive and a drag on the economy. so the ndp plan is overall less positive for the climate and more negative for economy at the same time. the liberal plan does the best for climate change, the conservative plan does the best for maintaining the economy,  and the ndp managed to do neither.",liberals

imo this is what canzuk should be;

- single trading bloc (allows for better trade deals with larger partners)

- greater military cooperation (i.e, canada working with the uk in the arctic to curb russian influence/canada working with australia and new zealand to help contain china in the pacific)

- free travel zone (canada/australia have different wildfire seasons, so it would allow more free and rapid movement during particularly difficult crises, as an example)

- greater corporate competition (canadian airlines and telcos desperately need this)

- facilitates trade amongst others (for example, the us currently imports many rare earth metals [zinc, iron ore being biggies] from china; with canzuk, the us has to work with only one entity rather than australia and canada seperately on ending chinese dominance)

other stuff too, but for canada, this means less reliance on the us without falling back to the ccp (autocratic) or bjp (semi-autocratic) or the eu (who we rely on to a great extent), it means lower costs for canadians, more jobs, cheaper leisure, etc.

&gt; part of my reason for entering politics was, as a visible minority woman, to show girls and women that it is possible for you to enter public life and to perform at a very high level for your country.

&gt; so when i had other women even asking me that question, i said to myself, ‘do male cabinet ministers get asked if the prime minister has called their stakeholders every day? why is it so important? what were they underestimating about me?’ and i still have a question about that.

for instance, geist references his own article on claims that c-10 provides economic thresholds for internet regulation. geist says the thresholds don't exist as nobody is defined as exempt from service regulations at the time of implementation, but then turns around and points out that the crtc has the power to provide exemption on a case by case basis after the bill is law. 

geist is complaining that internet service regulation reporting will be automatically opted in for companies providing service to canadians, instead of having a low dollar value threshold coded into the law. 

i don't see how that's a problem.

similarly in this article, geist complains that the cabinet appeal process removal for crtc action is a violation of due process, but in my personal view due process doesn't have to be afforded to corporations in the same way it is for human being canadians. i don't want a multi-billion dollar company to be able to suck enormous amounts of money out of the government via extended litigation tactics, or be able to directly lobby cabinet via cabinet appeals.

it's weird, what geist writes is factual but his preferred telecom regulation isn't something i see being very practical.",liberals

i would rather just make more less lethal options legal; until the general public embraces less lethal options as a means of protection. then we just have to address the hunting/sport shooting scene. though since sport shooting is generally only supposed to take place on a range - it would make sense to just have those arms stored under heavy security at the actual range.",liberals

it's hard for me to say that a paper deliberately spreading proven falsehoods like anti-vax and qanon etc. through print and social media advertising, even if a genuinely held belief, is in good faith when it is completely unhinged from reality and immune to criticism.

&gt;most epoch times stories refer to covid-19 as “the ccp virus,” a reference to the chinese communist party, and \\**several have pushed the unsubstantiated claim the virus may have been manufactured in a wuhan lab.lthe paper’s editorial board even ran a piece claiming that denouncing communism cures covid-19.*

doesn't sound like good faith to me.. in addition to them peddling ghouliani's election fraud conspiracies.

the past 5 years have shown we are far, far too lenient on obvious grifters for the sake of our precious civility. it seems that we can't call people out as con artists anymore because, well whaddyaknow the con-artist swears they're not a con-artist! who would have guessed such a thing. we shouldn't concern ourselves with whether peoples delusions are genuinely held or not, i'm far more concerned with the actual damage done by those delusions. i mean, the falun gong leader claims the ability to *levitate*, he just can't show anyone for.. reasons. he also promises high level practitioners will can gain up to 10,000 superpowers. that alone should be an immediate cause to dismiss any claims of good faith right off the bat.

other claims include that lgbt people and immigrants are part of an extraterrestrial plot to destroy humanity:

\"**the way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races, causing human beings to become rootless people**, just like the plant hybrids people make nowadays. s**outh americans, central americans, mexicans and some people in south east asia—all of these races have been mixed.** none of this can evade the gods’ eyes. **alien beings have made rather extensive preparations for overtaking human beings**.\"

their teachings literally attack the very foundation of our country. multiculturalism, tolerance, etc.

but that's largely besides the point because of the other bigger issue of the conspiracy authoritarian/trump/completely in a delusional reality/anti-vax/fundamentally irresponsible and dangerous culture and dynamic that controls the base and the idea of what conservative means in our society, and in that way determines the direction and the political energy, actions, accountability, and ethics of the movement.

peter lougheed did not have this kind of dynamic, nor even did harper. i could imagine a peter lougheed-type figure getting the social conservatives in line to support a more moderate approach that could win power, but the conspiracy reactionaries would hate and never accept that type of leader or that compromise.

i agree with you that social conservatism needs to go, but it's not just that.

it's interesting, we talk about social conservatives as a category in canada in a way that's like it's all just about abortion and personal support of same sex marriage or whatever like we're frozen in the harper years, but we shouldn't downplay this trump/q/authoritarian cruel chaotic reactionary aspect either and we shouldn't just lump it in with the concept of social conservatives, because it's very different.

they have crossover with the social conservatives, like, you know, sometimes they're both homophobic together or support dangerous people like trump or cruel policies together, but it's also a completely different beast that brings in people who in many ways aren't socially conservative or even conservative in any meaningful sense of that term at all but rather are motivated by chaos and a radical but ill-considered and often harmful desire for upheaval that threatens order, society's functioning (as we are seeing very clearly here in doug ford's ontario), and fundamental social cohesion.

these are extremely not classically conservative ideas or ways of doing things and it is to me a direction that leads to disorder and social harm, but i don't think there's a winnable \"conservative\" coalition in canada right now that wouldn't involve keeping this culture in your political movement. which to me is fundamentally irresponsible and dangerous.",conservatives
