that said, i think the pessimism is well-founded. from an electoral standpoint (which i know the article isn't about), we are definitely seeing the meme-driven reactionary side making renewed efforts to grab a foothold in canadian politics and starting to suck all the oxygen out of the room as far as conservatives are concerned. 

i can only expect that this will continue, and will continue to be something that's absolutely fatal to a substantive and serious conservative agenda. even if these people somehow get elected, they are politically and ideologically incapable of enacting anything approaching substantive policy, because their base and political style is so rooted in rage and victimhood.",conservatives

when my kids were in daycare in ottawa i paid 1400-1500 a month for a home care. in montreal i paid about 200 and i was in a private daycare and not a cpe. 

funding spaces and childcare is revolutionary for a slice of the middle class for about 5 years per kid . that’s not nothing. it’s also got enormous impacts for kids in low ses households, high quality childcare brings them up to the same levels of reading and soft skills as middle income families which leads them to have a much greater likelihood of graduating, getting a mortgage and not going to jail later in life (tons of studies on this here and in the usa). which is to say nothing of the effect on women who are more often than not the ones forced out of the labour force to care for kids (they make less so they’re the partner that volunteers for the care work, and employers know they might leave so, they pay them less and fast track them for promotion less). high quality childcare is good for the future, good for the economy of the present, good for women, and good for the pocketbooks of most families. it’s a signature progressive issue in every other country.

ok you've already stopped following me here. 

fundamental to marxist philosophy is the idea that social structures determine individual behavior and that material conditions produce ideas. it's not personal evil and greed that makes business exploitative, it's the fact that production is organized towards maximizing the extraction of profit and accumulation of economic power, and that any business that doesn't maximize these things will get crushed by businesses that do. you can be a decent person within this system, but the imperative of surviving as a capitalist business will always limit how morally good your actions can be. you yourself admitted as much when you talked about the role of charity in ameliorating the issues created by the economy.

&gt;governments are bribed and influenced by the the business owners making them evil and greedy

&gt;society that voluntarily spend their money with these evil businesses because of convenience/price are evil and greedy

i think i overemphasized the role of govt/regulatory capture in my analysis of monopoly. this corruption and capture does inevitably happen of course, but monopolies would rise even without such dynamics, due merely to economies of scale and the outsize market power and leverage that a bigger business has over a smaller one. in short, the [matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthew_effect) makes monopolistic concentration of economic power more or less inevitable in a free market economy given enough time.

again, none of this is about personal vice or evil, it is purely a result of the inevitable structural logic of capital.

&gt;because we have faith that with today's technology we can implement this planned economy and it will be more efficient, less exploitative and more just than our current system and won't fall victim to the violence of previous planned economies?

i mean, you have to admit that such transitions have worked many times before. modern bureaucratic firms and states, made possible by modern information technology, would have been unthinkable to the romans or the incas and are a whole lot better for the common people living under them than ancient political organization.

as hayek and other conservatives pointed out about the failed soviet experiment, it is certainly possible to succumb to rationalist hubris and overestimate what is possible to plan and control with the technologies you have. however, when those technologies progress the frontier of possibility will progress along with them, and at that point it cannot be stopped.",conservatives

the issue isn't about compensation, or the amount of compensation ordered by the canadian human rights tribunal, it's that [tribunals do not have the legal authority to make orders to the canadian federal government](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-human-rights-tribunal-case-explainer-1.6228999).  in fact the government has indicated they want to pay more in compensation than what the tribunal has ordered.  if this compensation order is allowed to stand then that creates a legal precedent that suddenly gives tribunals power over the federal government in an unprecedent way.  our government has no choice but to fight this order, and that would be no different regardless of which party was currently leading the government.  the liberals just happen to be holding the bag at the moment.

and this is a big enough issue that the federal courts are right to punt this case to the supreme court of canada by siding with the lower courts to force the federal government to take this matter all the way to the supreme court of canada to make a final ruling if another legal government entity can supersede the federal government other than the supreme court of canada.

and of course on the other side, we have indigenous people deserving of compensation being forced to wait while the government basically fights with itself over a technicality, but a technicality that could completely re-write the canadian constitution and potentially limit the power of the federal government of canada in a pretty extreme way.  there is a lot of bad will from the canadian people to pressure the government to drop this case due to not fully realizing how significant this case is to canadian governance.

this is why op’s article is commenting of the federal government's push for an out of court compensation package being accepted by the indigenous people in the case as soon as possible so that this issue can be dropped and the court challenge doesn't take place.  you can bet if such a package is accepted it will be for significantly more than the $40,000 to each complainant that the tribunal ordered.",liberals

grkq8p4,2021-03-19T19:44:53.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention to start at the end and work our way back.. no, the libs didn't claim it first. it actually started as a conservative idea. and for all the reasons you mentioned. it was part of the original cpc platform. the conservatives abandoned it many years ago. because it doesn't work in practice. 

here is the short version - we can dig into the details later if you still want to. 

for commercial entities it really doesn't incentivize them much. they are already incentivized to make changes and reductions where possible if it's less expensive to operate that way. so this really doesn't make a difference. so what they do by and large is just pass the costs on to the consumer. it now costs x dollars more for farmers to produce their ..er.. produce. (english is a stupid language sometimes).  so - they add that price to the cost of the produce. then a trucker has to drive that produce to market and that cost is added, and the grocer passes that on to the customer, who is now paying carbon taxes twice - his and also the cost of producing his food. 

worse - grocers may buy produce from other countries who's farmers don't have carbon taxes and can charge lower prices. you'll still pay the extra for the trucking tho. 

i use farming as an example but it applies to a lot of industry and costs. 

so then there's the consumer. carbon taxes were based on the idea of what economists call 'elasticity'. that's basically the ability and willingness of people to alter their spending or consumption habits. they assumed a high level of elasticity for energy costs. in other words, if prices went up then consumers would use less gas or energy as a choice 

unfortunately, it has become clear that there is much less elasticity than was previously expected. so - when energy prices go up it turns out people still need to heat their homes and drive little jimmy to soccer practice and pick up groceries. 

so - instead of cutting costs on energy they tend to cut costs on other optional spending. so limited savings on energy - but a slowing of the economy. 

the only way that carbon taxes reduce emissions is if they are so high that they seriously damage the economy and create an economic drag. that's why proponents are now asking for triple or quadruple the rates. you need to tax people so hard that they cut all the extra costs they can and then are forced not to take jimmy to soccer and to keep their homes colder and to go out and buy less groceries. 

it is a failed idea. a little carbon tax might help a small amount but really it does nothing at all to help reduce emissions and it isn't good for the economy at all. 

we need better ideas. fortunately there are some.",conservatives

to clarify, i think a big issue with our ucp and andp governments for the past 5-6 years has been their response to budgetary issues. the alberta governments problem right now is that it's spending has constantly been about 2-3% of gdp higher than revenues since the 2015-2016 budget, which in the short term isn't a big deal, but both government's long term spending projections maintain that imbalance and instead rely on overly optimistic royalty revenue projections to finance the post 2015 spending increases rather than new taxes or spending reductions (or some combination of both.)

that means if current budgetary practices are continued going into the 2030s or 2040s, debt servicing will take a pretty significant cut out of services and austerity in the form of massive spending cuts/tax increases will likely be needed by then.

the only party last election that actually addressed that problem and proposed a solution was  the liberals and they only got less than a percent of all votes last election. overwhelmingly the biggest issue for our province right now is that the electorate is enabling parties  that tell them what they want to hear rather what they need to.

we don't want a pst or other new taxes, but we also don't want to cut expenditures as a percentage of gdp back to prentice era levels. both notley and kenny's government genuinely deserve blame for that, but we can't blame them without blaming ourselves (the electorate in general) .

there is a process for requesting these documents that the cpc is refusing to follow. when you request terrorism documents, you must follow a process where the attorney general and counter-terrorism officials must vet the documents first before being released. the same process goes for national security and the potential violation of someone's privacy rights. ian stewart stated before parliament that releasing all the documents would compromise national security and individual's privacy. the second of which is protected by the charter.

furthermore, it was always been justice department policy to not hold parliamentary privilege as an absolute right. if parliament wants unrestricted access to documents that agencies claim the law protects, they must go to the courts.

not in a society dead set on cutting safety nets, discriminating based on race, and no programming to help people out of situations that make theft necessary.

&gt; the theif's choice was to violate the personal property and personal safety rights of an individual, and to force them and others to bear the cost for their criminal behaviour.

no personal safety rights are violated by mere theft, only the right to your property is interfered with. they are totally separate concepts. 

&gt; don't need permission. they try to violate my personal property rights i will not bear the cost of that, or risk my safety to stop them, but they will not succeed. by the theft they're choosing to risk their life. that is their choice.

and by choosing to engage in violence with intent to kill as a first resort, you are acting directly against any laws that could protect your actions and you would absolutely be convicted of murder or manslaughter. they did not choose to risk their life by stealing, those chose to risk their freedom. you are imputing a choice on them that they never made. 

&gt; this is you trying to justify theft. insurance isn't free money from the sky. everyone is paying because you want to allow people to steal.

never once justified theft, i am opposing your attempt to justify murder as a first response to theft rather than using the social systems in place to address it. 

&gt; because the choices are:

&gt;a) allow the violation of personal property rights, potential assault, and/or sexual assault, and/or murder. even if it's only the theft, it still has to be paid for and someone has still been victimized.

the last three already allow for the use of force when there is a *real* risk of it, and by real i mean they are banging on your bedroom door knowing you are inside of it, not they're in the living room trying to unplug your tv. we are not discussing the latter three, we are discussing the first exclusively. you are trying to equate the fact a person is stealing to the fact they also intend to commit assault, sexual assault, or murder. this is fundamentally not true. 

&gt;b) the victim tries to use their legal right to prevent the theft, assuming they're even physically cavalry of doing so, risking their safety and life to do so . 

they can also just call the police and not engage with the thief by staying where they are safe, in your words \"pretty easy to do\". 

&gt;c) the theif is prevented from stealing, from harming anyone, and the innocent potential victim does so while ensuring their own personal safety.

&gt;option c is moral, options a and b are not.

the thief whose only intent to harm someone physically is in your imagination? you are equating the intent to steal to the intent to cause harm for every thief. the fact someone is planning to take an item in no way indicates intent to physically hurt a person. you are venturing far into the hypothetical to justify actually killing a person.",liberals

i do think we need to control guns, and i do think we do a great job of it general. utility weapons for hunting and sport are good! restricting things like hand guns is good! banning them outright is stupid. some weapons should be banned, sure. no one needs a machine gun, for example, or any other fully automatic weapon. but handguns? various types of non automatic shotguns? come on. i really hate to repeat a right wing argument here, but it isn't the lawful handgun owners going out there and perpetrating violence. there are plenty of legitimate target shooters out there that respect the restrictive rules, jump through all the hoops, and behave in a very safe manner with their weapons so that they can own a handgun.

of course, this isn't to say banning weapons doesn't have real impacts on crime/suicide/accidents. instead it's more to say that we need to actually look at these things and not react in a knee jerk manner. it's important to ask where the weapons used for crimes like the shooting in ns come from. very frequently they aren't legally obtained, and more weapon bans would have had zero effect on the commission of the crime.

it's always really important to keep the effect of the ban in mind and not just react positively or negatively based on emotion. both the left and the right are pretty bad for using this crap to rile up their bases and divide us, and it's led directly to the mess of restricted and banned weapons lists that we currently have, along with plenty of railing against perfectly sensible legislation to improve gun ownership &amp; control.",liberals

the common law system is pretty slow the first time but once the precedent is established there tends not to be a reason to resolve this in court and the system is working again.  i can predict what severance my employer will give me and any employment lawyer can predict the change after he writes a letter.  there isn't really anything being discovered in these cases.  both systems eventually get to the same point (unless the board is pre-emptively changing policies to address court challenges that haven't happened yet(which is something that is hard to comprehend) both take a while to get their the first time.  

i fully agree it is a provincial issue and if it happened in alberta federal interference would also be discouraged by the province.  i still think the issue would end up in front of the supreme court of canada as a discrimination issue and it would be decided there.

if the issue is a sovernty issue that quebec can do what it wants with its employment structure.  the case is simple quebec can.  if it is a discrimination issue based on religion the issue is federal and also clear cut  the sikhs (most visibly) and others have been working very carefully to discover those policies for the last 30 years.   the reality is that it is both and that makes it much messier.

hoz7ac3,2021-12-17T06:30:22.000-08:00,"[deleted by user] you hit the nail pretty much right on the head.

we actually *do* have a lot of evidence for what types of gun regulations are really effective at improving public safety, viz.: 

* background checks
* safety training
* competency testing
* smuggling interdiction, and 
* the provision of proper resources to do those things well. 

if there are kids in the home, then you can add \"storage laws\" to that list. the problem is that \"improving implementation for boring, effective things\" makes people safer, but it isn't very useful for pandering.

on the other hand, you have gun laws that *feel* right to people who don't know anything about the topic, but are completely useless:

* banning suppressors
* \"paperwork for paperwork's sake\" rule changes to atts
* prohibiting suppressors, which are considered widely-available safety devices in nearly all of europe
* banning the guns that *looks* scariest to a torontonian [who would happily ban all guns](https://globalnews.ca/news/6893821/firearms-ban-ipsos-poll-canada/)

these things don't do anything to improve safety, but they poll *great* among people who have no exposure to the topic.

anecdotally: when i was first getting my license, the rcmp had the contact info of my then-recent ex. my ex had no issue vouching for my safety, but when i called to thank her for being a reference, i found out that they'd *never actually called her*. i found out later that this is because they have fewer than twenty people conducting these checks, so they'll skip steps if they see enough green flags in an application.

meanwhile, we're about to spend a billion dollars on a security theatre buyback.

if you wanted to dance on a few graves for political gain, and you didn't care if you were passing policy that actually improved anything, you'd have a gun platform strikingly identical to trudeau's.",liberals

&gt;they also gave huge tax grants to keep people employed which sounds to me very pro labour (and nationalizing the debt instead of making the individual bear it is pretty economically left).

that was actually an extremely pro-capital move, as they gave the money to corporations, no strings attached, rather than to workers directly, many of which used it to fuel dividends and bonuses while laying off workers. not sure how you think a government could make individuals bear the goernment's debt. 

&gt;when you buy yourself a pipeline and then build another one it is very hard to claim you have no interest in nationalizing an industry.

when you nationalize an industry or discuss nationalizing an industry it shows an interest in nationalizing an industry. when you instead just spend public money on projects to help private corporations, which is what trudeau has done on the pipeline front, you're just serving the interests of capital. canada's energy and resource policy as a whole is extremely far right. 

&gt;workers rights might be bad but that isn't on trudeau to change that is very clearly provincial (and the provinces have been moving on that since he came in). however on that aspect he is forcing provinces to do $10/day daycare which seems pretty big to me. healthcare is also provincial so take it failing up with your premier not wanting to collect taxes.

people like to use jurisdictional arguments only when convenient to absolve the federal government of responsibility. in reality, there is far more overlap then your suggesting. in the same way that the federal canada health act sets conditions for the provinces to recieve money for healthcare, the government could, by the exact same mechanism, implement national pharmacare tomorrow. hypothetically, provincial governments would be free to commit electoral suicide and reject the money, but that's never really been an issue before in canada. 

he admittedly has less power over workers' rights generally, but in federally regulated industries he has all the power and has done very little to improve things from their dire state, a move which, if he had done so, could compel provinces to follow suit.",liberals

so? trudeau formed gov't with less than that. c'mon -  i know math is hard but even you should have been able to figure that out. 

and it wouldn't take much more than the cpc got to put them in the winning circle. which is what i said. 

&gt;as for gun control, it isn't an issue that the cpc would want to die on, nor will they even come close to getting suburban voters with it as a election commitment.

actually not only is it a strong winning platform for them since they went hard at it in the last 15 years or so, it can do wonders in suburbia. the gun control of the liberals is expensive and wasteful, and people get pissed at it as an excuse not to address real crime issues. look at paul martin and his 'handgun ban' after the mall shooting of that young girl. they know fake solutions when they see them. 

this is the part where you say \"but but but .. the cpc won a major victory with an anti-gun-control platform ten whole years ago - none of those humans are alive anymore and people have completely changed!!!

yeah, no. 

of course they have a feasible platform for climate change and frankly there's many others. the libs are going to have a tough time selling theres which they just got ripped for.  and as you'll note from the article it's falling behind the economy and inflation as a primary concern. you can't ignore it but you aren't getting elected on it any more. 

\"inflation will come down\" has been the battle cry for months now. \"transitory\". \"temporary\".  but it wasn't. not only is it not going away, it's getting worse and far exceeds the original predictions and will stay high for a long time. because it's not about supply chain issues primarily in canada. and it will likely be succeeded by a serious economic downturn. 

all of which can be expected when the leader 'doesn't think about monetary policy'. i mean - it's not like he hides it.

you're confused. canada is economically right-wing, in fact almost every western country is economically right-wing, because we follow liberal capitalism, primarily minimum regulations and extensive private sector involvement. liberal in an economic sense means *free*, as in, free enterprise, minimum regulations.

the economic spectrum is communism (left-wing) or capitalism (right-wing).

i am highlighting the fact that most if not all developing countries tend to be economically left-leaning, there is a higher tendency to follow socialist or communist policies in those countries, particularly extensive government ownership, extensive government regulations (red tape), and high taxation.

we shouldn't be following economic policies proposed by immigrants from the third world. at all.

&gt;didnt you say you were an immigrant? are you not conservative either then?

&gt;the easiest way to prove you wrong is to just steer you towards a march for life event where minorities make up a huge % of those who are gathered. the reason immigrants dont stand up in huge numbers in these issues are due to the progressive nature of native canadians. if native canadians dont stand up for an issue, do you expect outsiders to even think about challenging the issue? the most socially conservative people i have met were fellow immigrants, i have yet to meet a social conservative in my age range that wasnt an immigrant. 

if they don't stand up for social conservative issues then that just means we need fewer immigration because they're just political dead weight or seeking left-wing handouts.

&gt;how the heck are you gonna conserve anything if you dont campaign and just shut up? you have been losing for the last 4-5 decades. if you want to win this battle you have to bring in the most soc con group in canada to fight with you. you arent gonna conserve anything without the numbers.

see above, and immigration reform.

as a conservative my point is not to *win* elections, my point is to conserve this country. if the majority of canadians are willing to destroy the historical identity of canada by voting left-wing parties then that is our destiny and we can blame the canadian people. in a democracy, the people are to blame.

furthermore, as a conservative, i've already made up my mind, if canadians want to destroy our historical identity then so be it. if *immigrants* cared about our historical identity but did nothing about it then they're part of the problem too.

to be completely honest, many, if not the majority of the people on the right, are becoming accelerationists, we're waiting for the country to collapse under the leftists.

for example, a rising homicide rate? if people aren't voting right-wing policies to increase policing then i am hoping our homicide rate increases more under the leftist regime. rising inequality? if people don't vote for right-wing immigration reform then i hoping we see more and more violent crime ridden and poverty-stricken ethnic enclaves. 

the public won't *understand* until it becomes a real crisis. i'm not here to convince leftist voters, i am here to speak with other conservatives to make immigration reform part of our platform, and if the leftist voters don't like it then well it's gonna be on the hands of the leftists that this country goes into a crisis.",conservatives

don't remember the liberals being thrilled with it at the time. 

it's really not a matter of concern for the opposition to find a solution for the liberals which will allow them to obstruct oversight. parliament is fully within its power to request any of the governments records, the executive does not have grounds to refuse and there is zero reason why parliament should ever back down from that. fundamentally the prime minister should be the one offering the solution for why parliament should not simply exercise its powers and why parliament should accept his proposal. 

what parliament can do is to set rules within itself for how those records will be handled, but that is not something for the prime minister to dictate to parliament or that he has say in parliament beyond the votes he can muster. to suggest otherwise is a fundamental betrayal of the system of government we have and the very concept of democratic oversight.

paradoxically a society built on homes with backyards offers a poor quality of life, for a few reasons:

1) low density eliminates public transport solutions, causes car dependence, which is the most expensive, inefficient way to move a population around  
2) low density causes the travel distances to increase, making commuting horrible  
3) low density detached housing requires super high property taxes to replace far-flung   infrastructure, which is basically a financial time-bomb for municipalities when it comes time to replace it.

i understand what you’re saying and objectively it’s the same with the veil, it’s not technically a religious obligation, women that wear are doing it for their personal convictions not to show off their attachment to their religion and this is definitely a good point and one of the reason why i’m not particularly comfortable with law 21 as it is (surprise surprise i’m not a fan of it myself believe it or not). that being said i like many quebecois do believe showing your belonging to a religion or ideology while working in certain positions of authority for the government is an important issue that need resolve. i think you did answer my questions tho wearing something that associate you with an ideology (even if that’s not the primary goal) isn’t a problem for you as long as that ideology is deemed acceptable and every case should pretty much be evaluated case by case if an issue arise.

personally i think that the uniform for people in positions of authority should be as impersonal as possible, they shouldn’t permit people to express personality through them, they are stewards of the state all they should express is the generic function of the state, like judges with their robes and wigs tho that should probably be modernized. it’s boring cold and sad i guess, but that’s fair and just unlike what we have at the moment (well pre-law 21) which is what you like. 

the bona fide occupational requirement is to represent the state which allows its constituents to receive services free off religion, showcasing anything remotely religious through the appearance goes against that (even if that’s not the primary goal).

i don't see the bill as solving any pressing issues that requires a restriction on freedoms, nor do i even believe that an individual behind a desk is \"the state\". if the cops were forced to wear religious garb as a part of their uniform, yes there is a problem, but if a single person decides to wear it, how is that the state being religious? the government job gives you the power, the person themselves does not have it by default and in my view, they are not the state, the job in and of itself is.

in any case, if the individual did for whatever reason let their religion affect their work, there are already in place to deal with that. so how does the removal of that garb add anything? we are taking away rights (insofar as i can tell) for appearances only.

laïcité is about making choices without the influence of religion. it says nothing about what people can wear, only how they do their job.",conservatives

im a big proponent of letting people decide for themselves what works for them - if they like homes and private cars; great. if they like to live in condos - also great. demand and supply will sort it out.

the only thing government must do is not get in the way too much. no zoning restrictions beyond what is necessary; obligation to build infrastructure where it is needed; levy taxes to pay for it all, and not a cent more or less. and do not create roadblocks in the supply chains for housing construction too. the end. and everything will sort itself out.",liberals

in a way looking at france during the french revolution, i understand where quebec is coming from. people hated the clergy, one of the three estates of the ancien regime that had special privileges that the rest of society except the nobility in france didn't have. thats also why gay marriage was legalized in 1792 because law makers of the first republic wanted to spite the church. 

quebec too had its own issues with the rcc. this is why since the quiet revolution, they have been reducing the influence of religion in society. from the quebec perspective, loi 21 is a way to remain secular through and through. i just dont think english canada will ever understand it properly.

the end result is that, under s. 90, the governor general (i.e. the federal government) is permitted to disallow provincial laws within a year of those laws being passed. you're correct though that s. 90, when read on its own, is basically gibberish.",liberals
