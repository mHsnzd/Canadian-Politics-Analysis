only karahalios poses a real threat of splitting the right locally, as cambridge is far from a safe tory seat and could go liberal/ndp if part of the pc vote splits off (in fact it is a liberal seat federally, and karahalios only narrowly won in 2018, helped by an unusually strong liberal incumbent who prevented the ndp from making big gains like they did in the rest of the tri-cities/brantford area). nicholls and hillier will be contesting very safe tory seats that even a split shouldn't be able to take away from the pcs - unless they do very well, like north of 15%, or the pcs lose the election handily.

if ppc strength from september is any indicator of the electorate of these kinds of parties, they won't do much in the gta. the kinds of places where the ppc got a lot of support in ontario were either rural, safe tory seats that ford should have no problem holding onto, or \"populist left\" type places like timmins-james bay and the windsor area, where ppc strength seemed to hurt the ndp more than anything else. at the same time, the presence of these parties allows ford to pivot to at least an ostentatiously moderate position.

on balance, i don't think this really hurts the pcs all that much. it's unlikely that the centre-left vote will converge any more than last time - del duca is not a very appealing leader and the liberals are short on cash, but it's hard to see the olp doing worse than 2018, and liberal gains will probably come at the ndp's expense (who themselves are saddled with an unremarkable leader). under these circumstances, ford can afford to lose a few % on the right.",liberals

hqp06tt,2021-12-31T00:06:09.000-08:00,"perpetual anger not working for conservatives ah see, that’s where you misunderstand me. i think we should break up the massive corporate power structures. build competing interests in industries where lack of competition is a natural consequence - like telecoms. or even better, the canadian people should own the lines, and the cost for using them should be set low enough that small telecom companies can be founded by individuals who wish to do so.

the problem is that regulation is *necessary*. there really isn’t a way around it, due to the nature of the economy. companies are only designed to generate money. if that involves poisoning entire towns, they will do the maths on whether it’s worth it *financially*. no time gets spent on the morality, because that’s not incentivized under our system. 

regulations are what either force companies to *not* harm people, or make them pay the *actual* cost of their actions. if you’re familiar with the term “externalities”, these are things that the corporations (and not our taxes) should be paying for. we can’t make them pay without regulations, if they were an inherent cost then they wouldn’t be “external”.

on to your abortion point, i looked it up - women can indeed have an abortion at any stage of pregnancy according to *federal* law. yet 90% of abortions happen within the first trimester, when *none* of what you said is true. on top of that, each province has been allowed to set the limit on when abortions can be performed, and the latest is 24 weeks - the second trimester. this is the case in alberta, the most conservative province in canada. at this point the organs are *partially* formed, and the foetus looks recognizable as human. but i have to ask you, why do you think 10% of women who get an abortion let the baby reach this point? 24 weeks is more than long enough to decide you want it, right? it’s been living inside you, developing. it can’t kick yet, but you know it’s there. can you imagine what would make you make that decision? illness? potential death? i don’t know, and neither do you! a woman who decides she needs to have an abortion that late is *clearly* having to make a difficult decision for the reasons you suggest. also, may i point out, making abortion illegal won’t stop it from happening. it will just force women into “back-alley” clinics, where they *won’t* adhere to the 24 week limit. ironically your proposed solution would make your horror story *more* likely and not less.

as for reconciliation you are just plain wrong. canada committed genocide against the first nations. we have what we have *thanks* to that genocide. your whole response to this issue belies either  horrific ignorance or horrific callousness, neither of which i have the energy to deal with today. trust me, being born in the uk i’m used to uncomfortable truths about my ancestors, but turning away is an act of *supreme* cowardice. your denial will not bring the dead children back, heal the horrors of the residential school system, nor fix the centuries of broken treaties.",conservatives

like, genuine question, because i've been wondering this: do you people who want restrictions lifted *actually, legitimately* want \"fuck it, pretend it doesn't exist, and just hope no one in your family are the ones who dies from it\"? or have you just got fed up with the government being too cowardly to actually do anything about it, so you're just lashing out at said government's feeble attempts?

genuine question number 2: do you understand what 'flatten the curve' actually meant? do you actually think it was 'this virus will be gone in 2 weeks :)'? because it wasn't. it was \"holy shit, we need to slam the brakes *now*, if we don't do so within the next two weeks or so, we're going to incapacitate our medical system and things will get even worse\".

being irreligious, most east asians do not have a strong view on sexual orientation, transsexualism, abortion, euthanasia, etc. with the exception of koreans, who are mostly conservative christians. east asia is the most secular region in the world and most people have no religious affiliation (fact check statcan if you do not believe it or read this [https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/why-are-east-asians-not-into-religion](https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/why-are-east-asians-not-into-religion)). if asian parents are upset about their children being gays and lesbians, the main reason is usually the lack of grandchildren. there is no such concept of being \"sinful\" or the like.

personally, like most asian immigrants, including those who are gays and lesbians, the most important political issue is the continued infiltration by china and the pernicious effects that could have for us in this country. all east asians are very, very mindful of the internment of the japanese during wwii, an issue which is still an everyday topic in the japanese community. to me, lgbt issues only affects me and lgbt communities but china will harm all canadians and the entire world. witness what is happening in the world during the current pandemic. everyone in my community firmly believed, right from day one, that covid was manufactured in a chinese laboratory. like a lot of asians, i have also been a victim of racial abuses in the past year. i blame the chinese government for those. can you imagine what will happen when the west goes into war with china? don't forget that china has kidnapped 2 canadian citizens as well! these are the issues that keep me awake at night, seriously.

for the reasons above, we feel that the conservative's hardline stance on china is the best for us and will protect us, and hence the widespread support for the tories among east asians. i, for one, will vote for the conservatives in the next election.",conservatives

skimming the paper (which is all i've done so far) it speaks of transmission, but it seems to posit limitless transmission of power across the nation, and assumes a breakthrough in storage that doesn't exist yet.

let's jump to today. a good example is the amount of vocal support some far-leftists have for the pflp. a marxist terrorist organization responsible for numerous attacks and deaths. some examples include some student groups and unions^(1), university departments^(2), ndp mpp joel harden^(3), and ndp mp charlie angus^(4). so far i have only cited examples of the far-left openly supporting members of an avowed marxist, palestinian/arab nationalist, jew killing terrorist organization, all of which is quite recent.  if you do not think the far-left has an antisemitism problem (including here in canada) you are naive or willfully blind.

not regardless of how much it costs.  if that would be true, it would be reasonable to assign all taxes to healthcare and there would be no competing 'rights' other than free healthcare.  there are so many other public services that compete for the tax dollar.  education, basic infrastructure such as roads, sewers, clean water, police services.  all of these are essential services.  we must look at all of these as things that we value and although it is a constant struggle for balance, it is important to preserve services that have obvious value for everybody.  to use the trump card of 'rights' is not helpful.  

if you want to talk about rights, you have to remove healthcare because essentially nobody has the right to demand services from somebody else and that is what you are proposing when you say that healthcare is a human right.  if i am a healer you cannot command me to heal somebody else.  you may appeal to my better nature.  otherwise you must coerce me by forcing me to provide healthcare 'or else'.  this is more or less the system as it exists and this is the reason for the failure of the system.  

much as the soviet union forced farmers into collective farming, forcing medical practitioners to provide healthcare has yielded similar returns; namely a lack of productivity, a cynical and corrupt reaction to highly regulated billing and practise codes, and long wait times to see specialists.  not to mention healthcare providers who are defensive and unwilling to give of their best for fear of litigation or running afoul of the onerous regulations.  you will get mostly opportunists in such a system.    

after working in healthcare for over 40 years i have concluded that 'free' healthcare is a bad idea.  it's bad in terms of the standard of care.  it's bad in terms of cost.  it's bad in terms of promoting excellence and innovation.

the only hope for medicare in canada is an admission that the 'one size fits all' model of healthcare is a prescription for mediocrity at best and probably much worse.",liberals

i don't think this is accurate.  i have considered all options over my many years and i've come to the conclusion that most social programs are doomed to failure because when anything is free it essentially has no value.  that isn't to say that everybody will be corrupt when working within a social program.  it's just that you must presume to know what people want when you take taxes and create social programs.  it removes the choice that a person needs if he or she is to exist as an individual.  i will always disagree with some aspects of a social program that i am forced to pay for.

while i may not like the product or service that i'm being offered on the free market, i am not coerced into purchasing the product or service beyond what i need to survive, and while capitalism may deal me a bad hand such as dealing with a competitive system with low intellect, poor health, or perhaps bad habits, the system itself creates enough overall wealth that the poorest within the capitalist system are generally better off than the poorest within a socialist system.

it's a bad system but it's a lot better than taxing the rich while pretending to benefit the poor.  i would be in favour of a flat percentage tax to provide a basic universal income.  this would replace almost all of the redistrubutive tax programs such as ui, welfare, and the many subsidies for housing, food, medical, etcetera.  give people a choice and leave them to make their own decisions with enough basic income to buy food, pay for rent, pay for basic services.  

no, your ideas are pretty toxic for a lot of us and it isn't necessarily because we're rich and hate the poor or anything close to that.

my understanding of bill c-10 is that it is being proposed to allow government to regulate streaming services to force them to provide a minimum amount of canadian content (like radio and tv are required to). 

i don’t know a whole lot about c10, so i could be missing something or failing to connect the dots… maybe it could allow isp’s to gain power over what is delivered to you. i dunno! but as i understand it, c10 shouldn’t interfere with nn. 

fwiw i’m not advocating for c10, and am a very strong believer in nn. i think government imposing regulations on what can and can’t be viewed in canada is setting a dangerous precedent and we should absolutely nip it in the bud. but it is a different problem than losing nn.",liberals

the point is that you need the support of the country and not just a few middling provinces. ontario isn't enough alone to form government either, no province is. quebec and ontario together can, but they're 2/3 of the population of the country. 

canada as a country doesn't want conservative leadership, that's been shown repeatedly for nearly a decade and we're gearing up to likely see the cpc lose even more seats. alberta and sask want conservatives in power but they have the power to vote whoever they want into leading their provinces, which they have (and displayed the quality of their judgment at the same time, just look at jason kenney).

lets look at this with how the media and politicians in the us and canada portray the ar-15. if you watch and listen to the media people are dying like crazy from this mass-murder military rifle. it is everything that they want banned. but even while it has been used for some horrific acts, the actual impact banning assault style rifles will be minimal in both canada and the us, so minimal in fact that the impact these laws would have would fall into what would be considered next to nothing. in canada before april 2020 the ar was used in 1 crime in canada, a mob hit that used one smuggled in from the us (same as the one in april 2020). so twice..... in the us they do not keep stats for the specific fire arm, but all rifles, all of them so everything from a single shot .22cal up to full auto military rifles only account for 2% of firearms deaths. so dont we want laws that are going to cost the government somewhere between 250 mil to a 1 bil ( current estimate of our buyback) have more of an impact?

i am sorry but the facts and stats dont line up with your personal experience, and we should be making actual evidence based policy and doing things that actually have an impact. fighting poverty and homelessness, better mental health funding, more border security, and better support for drug addicts. a better chance at life a person has the less likely they are to get involved in crime.",conservatives

if you look at the liberals averages for most of this campaign, they've very rarely fallen below 32%, the lowest they polled this month before the 23rd was 32.9%. their poll drop for the last week for instance is mostly the result of a bad campaign and unnecessarily calling an early election, both of which have drawn the ire of the media and electorate. whether that continues until september 20th is unknown, but even if it does, the averages still show the liberals with 148-150 seats, so their minority isn't really in danger.

&gt;also, i haven't even heard about patrick brown running for federal leadership in the cpc and i'm wondering why of all people you chose him.

i didn't choose him, i stated he would be the best choice while questioning if he'd be willing/able to run by then (depending on how long stays in office as mayor of brampton) and whether the cpc's base would accept him. my point was moreso that if the cpc wants to form a government in 2025/26, they'd need to move to the centre on social and climate policy and abandon socially conservative positions and that brown would be the most likely person to follow through on that if he ran for cpc leadership.

&gt;he would also never get to that point since he's essentially unelectable after the sexual misconduct allegations.

from all accounts that doesn't seem to be an issue for brown any longer due to the lack of validity of those accusations (new information kept emerging that contradicted the accusations for instance). it's also worth noting that he likely would not have won the election to be mayor of brampton if the accusations were still considered even remotely relevant, which they don't seem to be in terms of media coverage or electoral support.",liberals

some hghlights:

* erin o’toole surprised and confused many by introducing the legalization of amyl nitrate and other “poppers” in the canadian election. poppers became known as a gay party drug in the 1980s and, until the past decade, were primarily associated with the gay club scene and online casual sex through applications like grindr.
* i want to argue that as absurd as the announcement and associated discourse are, the tories’ poppers promise tells us something important about the dramatic shifts our politics are undergoing due to new debates about gender and sexuality.
* let me assure you: he is not going after the small overwhelmingly urban, overwhelmingly culturally liberal constituency of gay men who like to party. that’s just his cover. o’toole is making his first intentional, programmatic, planned play for the porno right, the notoriously hard-to-poll, low-turnout constituency that turned out massively for donald trump and pushed him over the top in 2016.

i feel the pipeline has become a somewhat over inflated issue. i personally believe that the liberal government has no real desire to see it completed. yes they are jumping through the typical legal hoops to satisfy those who would want to see it completed, but i think they see the writing on the wall...

so if they saw this problem coming why buy the pipeline in the first place? why not let the private industry eat the loss? because that would have seriously effected canada's status as a viable place for businesses to invest.

if you're funding a project, it has government approval and yet you are unable to complete your project due to local protest, you might be upset with the government for approving it in the first place. so to avoid the hit to canada's future investments the liberals had to step in and buy out the project. or be forced to choose between forcing the pipeline through by force (like the rcmp are doing in fairy creek right now) or lose face on a global economic scale...i think they chose well.

still, the liberals have been a let down in many ways under trudeau...yes they have managed to pass progressive legislation, legalizing cannabis next door to the big proponent of the war on drugs is a bold move. but they really had the potential to have been so much more. if trudeau followed the money a little less and instead did what i believe he knows is right, canada could now be a world leader in the right respects; not some stupid un security seat. however compared to the harper years, these last few haven't been so bad.

federally i’ve been apart of edas for cpcs, greens, and in the 90s liberal because even though i lean centre-right that’s just where anybody in the centre ended up back then. the pcs were practically dead at the federal level, i was never very fond of the canadian alliance, and i was young, bright-eyed, and wanted a job in politics haha.

while not a common occurrence it’s also not incredibly rare either for edas to be this combative.

the liberal edas i was apart of in the late 90s/early 2000s were wild. it was very common to have entire boards wiped out in a single meeting depending on if the chrétien or martin people got control. from what i’ve heard though today liberal edas are pretty stable because the party structure under trudeau is very top heavy and won’t hesitate to disband and remove an eda that’s hostile.

that’s pretty common though when you’re the governing party, you tend to be a little bit more heavy handed with your edas because they can be an unnecessary source of controversy. one time in the mid-2000s i can recall a particularly bad case where the harper cpc actually went through the constitutional process of disbanding a riding association, only to reconstitute it under different leadership because the eda just refused to work with the candidate and that’s the fastest way to change who controls the bank account. in that example it was a very socially conservative eda that felt upset their candidate was too liberal because that candidate was supportive of marriage equality.

**judicial recount on application by an elector**
2.3.1 grounds upon which an elector may apply for a recount

upon application by an elector, a judge may conduct a judicial recount only if there is credible affidavit evidence of one of the following:

- an election officer incorrectly counted or rejected ballots.
- an election officer wrote an incorrect number on the statement of the vote, a document that enunciates the number of votes cast for each candidate.
- the returning officer incorrectly added up the results set out in the statements of the vote. [s. 301(2) of the act]

the burden of proof is fairly low at this stage of the proceedings.^footnote ^6 courts have granted recount applications on evidence of errors having occurred such as the incorrect counting of unused ballots, even though such errors did not affect election results.^footnote ^7 the election officer's obligation to count correctly—set out in s. 283 of the act—applies not only to the votes cast, but to all ballots. some judges have gone as far as to hold that the requirement on the judge to fix a date for the recount is mandatory if it appears certain that counting mistakes exist.^footnote ^8 there is case law considering the number of mistakes to be immaterial. a recount was granted in saskatchewan on evidence of only two votes being improperly rejected.^footnote ^9",liberals

you are vastly oversimplifying a tense situation and it worries me that many canadians indeed share your point of view. as donald trump has shown us, this simple and naive approach to geopolitics tends to have disastrous results. i think everyone wants to see a just resolution with the uyghur population but we also want to get the two michaels back to canada safe and sound. if we play our cards right, we can certainly accomplish both things.",conservatives
