i'm pretty sure that's by design. though i strongly disagree that the liberals won't be in power by then. 

if you're cynical, this is a decision that lets them win the next election over their covid response and keep childcare on the table to help them win the one after that. 

if you're practical, this is a decision that delays a significant new expenditure until the short term \"don't let covid fuck the economy altogether\" programs have run their course. 

personally, i think both angles have a lot of truth to them. but i think delaying at least five years is a very smart economic move. 

all of the studies that have concluded that public childcare is an economic win predicate their conclusions on the impact of freeing up an additional parent to enter the workforce. that's a rock solid justification in times of full employment, but if we're looking at a recession then adding public childcare would be an additional expense without the resulting economic growth to pay for it.",liberals

that having been said, is this really a widespread issue? i know the toronto context, and usually lines are designed specifically with developments in mind. for instance, the ontario line (and previous plans for downtown relief lines) were designed to go through the unilevel site on lake shore e, which is an old factory space that is planned for a large redevelopment centered around the subway. the sheppard line was designed to have a station at bessarion, which was put there specifically because of a large planned 45 acre development that was planned to go in next to it (concord park place).

in areas that don't have these planned in, they usually happen eventually anyways just because of market forces. developers come in and buy up houses at a high price, build a big condo building and make lots of money.

i guess we can agree to disagree. i'm my opinion it's an empty promise because most cities already support transit oriented developments. so it changes nothing. 

as for the other parties the liberals platform includes transit oriented development, actually mentions zoning and nimbyism in a way that's not tied to transit oriented development. also it has a concrete financial commitment, which as of right now the cpc plan does not. 

&gt; invest $4 billion in a new housing accelerator fund 
which will grow the annual housing supply in the
country’s largest cities every year, creating a target 
of 100,000 new middle class homes by 2024-25. 
this application-based fund will offer support to 
municipalities that: grow housing supply faster than 
their historical average; increase densification; 
speed-up approval times; tackle nimbyism and 
establish inclusionary zoning bylaws; and encourage 
public transit-oriented development. this fund will 
support a wide range of eligible municipal 
investments, including red tape reduction efforts, 
and reward cities and communities that build more 
homes, faster.

2) gov doesn't have to compromise on timeline, or amendments

4) if opposition raises fuss, gov can point to recent election as 'proof' canadians are behind their agenda

look at the past two years, for instance -- trudeau's cabinet had to work harder throughout the pandemic than they ever did during their first term, handling a massive public health response on top of normal parliamentary duties, chaos in the us, and multiple big foreign affairs events, all while rolling out several big government programs. 

during this entire time, they couldn't do anything without the support of the opposition, and even where they chose to compromise, they couldn't wear their policy successes as their own. take pandemic supports for instance -- they took on all political risk for this spending, attracting tons of conservative flak, and yet many canadians see this policy plank as something the government conceded versus led on. they're in a no win situation. 

for the record, i personally like minority government situations because they keep incumbents on their toes, and allow for more oversight. however, it's very common in westminster systems for minority governments to seek majorities after a couple years of stable governance, and i think it's silly for us to pretend as if this is some radical, unprecedented event.",liberals

well that's untrue, isn't it. they cost medical resources, they support criminal gangs who definitely hurt people, they frequently commit crimes to pay for their addictions... do you need more?  they absolutely hurt people.

legalizing dope was the right thing to do but it sure as hell didn't solve our organized crime issues. 

&gt;portugal's model is one that i'm sure you have heard of. 

yeah - and their economy is a total train wreck with massive overspending and employers forcing part time work on employees just to get by. not really interested in what they've got to say. if a solution is going to bankrupt us then i'd rather just let the drug user's die. as you say, why should we care if they're mostly hurting themselves.

100 percent of it is the responsibility of the person who puts the drugs in their body. and - that is the only place we can make meaningful change as a result.

unless you hold a few degrees and a couple of decades of experience i'm really not prepared to buy that. 

again - either someone comes up with a plan that makes sense based on hard experience and knowledge with specific goals and costs and we can look at moving forward, or let them work it out on their own.

the only interest-rate-centric policy i can think of that might help would be to adopt a higher inflation target.  if the target inflation band was 3-5% rather than 1-3%, the neutral interest rate would be higher, and mortgages would become proportionally harder to qualify for because prospective owners must qualify for nominally-fixed payments out of current (not inflation-adjusted) income.

my ideal government would be a liberal minority government that needs to be propped up by the ndp, at least with the current leaders in place. 

i’d prefer not to get into another discussion about israel-palestine, but while i disagree with the military actions of hamas that harm civilians i recognize that these are not equal adversaries. israel has the means of avoiding civilians casualties from bombings while hamas does not. israel however does take actions that cause far more death and suffering among civilians then those rockets, such as blockading gaza, stealing the vast majority of the west banks water or using live ammunition of protesters both back in 2018 and this year in the west bank.

of course, this kind of reform would likely take decades, and have tons of unintentional consequences. it is an interesting thought experiment more then anything. it is a laissez-faire implementation of ubi, and likely a reckless policy move, given what a radical change in society it would mark.

&gt; saudi arabia and the united states are close strategic allies and partners. however, the relationship witnessed certain decline during the last years of the obama administration, but strengthened following the election of president donald trump who forged close ties with the saudi royal family.

usually that means canada is also an ally, as we're tied to the hip with the us on most matters.

but much was made about twitter politics and how saudi grew *oh so angry* at us.  well that has subsided since.  frankly it was as implausible to cause such a stir as trudeau's tweet was to cause an influx of haitian migrants.  (yes, i believe twitter politics is fakepolitik.)

if we are allies, and it seems that we are, along with the us, then why in the hell do these weapons deals always draw such bs negative attention?

you: the committee chair said they were out of order, but the liberals and their buddies decided to ignore that.

reality: a liberal committee chair ruled they were out of order; a majority of committee members, made up of liberal, bloc, and ndp mps, voted to overrule that decision (not “decided to ignore” it, but to voted to overrule it, as they are procedurally permitted to do); and, the liberal speaker of the house overruled the committee vote.

i think you fully understand the differences between those two statements. yours: a) contains partial information; b) when speaking of alleged incorrect behaviour, identifies the liberal participants but omits the identities of others, as “buddies”; and, c) when speaking of alleged correct behaviour, omits the liberal identities of the participants.

election if they get stuck, and put the other party in the hotseat,   
instead of burning years waiting for the next opportunity

that is one of the biggest differences. in the states if the republicans don't support the new budget, it just doesn't get passed. and all kind of bad things happen but until they come to an agreement nothing can get paid or done. 

in canada if that happens in a minority (can't happen in a majority) then if the opposition wants to vote the new budget down, that means we go to the polls. and they'll have to explain to the voters why that was a good idea. voters generally don't like early elections without a good reason. 

now - that only applies to 'confidence votes\" . most votes are not confidence votes. but anything involving money always is and the gov't can declare something to be a confidence vote as well .and of course the oppositon can call a confidence vote if they feel it's time for an election. but the bottom line is there's a serious price to be paid for voting against many bills in canada and you never know how the voters will take it, so you need to be a lot more careful than in the states.

both ran tight ships. trudeau had a lot of people who were very loyal to him and there was a lot of inside pressure on anyone who disagreed. he was hard as a rock. i mean - this is the guy who declared the war measures act and flipped western canada the bird when he was pissed at them, literally. 

harper had a strong policy - anything goes in caucus away from the public eye and everyone gets heard and every idea gets debated - but once we've decided on how we're going to handle something, that's it - everyone toes that line 100 percent or you're gone.  period. 

chretien tried to rule without listening to his people and he got ousted in what's called a 'backbench revolt', where the mp's can basically pressure the hell out of the leader to resign and speak up against him or his policies publicly or even threaten to vote against a policy in the house and he was forced out of power in favor of paul martin. you will still occasionally hear references to \"martinites and chretienites' within the party, depending on what side of that someone was on.",liberals

oh yeah, and the ombudsmen have also said the government and minister are stonewalling investigation and crippling their office for political gain (or to prevent political loss.)

sajjan has lost the moral authority to lead a circus troop, let alone the canadian armed forces.

* no more full blast ac all summer long
* no more comfortably leaving your thermostats at 23c in your home.

so i guess, some fraction of money will get diverted to potentially green things. but there isn't really a reward/penalty system like the lpc has, and it would likely be a tiny fraction of the scale/effectiveness.

at least it does more than nothing. i think mainly the cpc want to avoid the effective progressive tax that the co2 tax causes (rich people waste more co2 and thus pay more in under the lpc system).",conservatives

let's make sure not to be mixing up the demographics that are in fact responsible for those emissions. those who live in the cities of china emit far more than the chinese rice farmers living a sedentary lifestyle.

for example, looking at the rural population (% of the total population) for china. 40% of the population lives in a rural setting.

while looking at the same statistics for luxembourg, only 9% live in a rural setting. 

these figures change the per capita emission if you are considering who is actually emitting. this would also explain why china would have a lower emission n per capita than say luxembourg where nearly the entire population is in an urban setting. 

while i don't have the exact figures of who is emitting what, i think it would be safe to assume that the rice farmers are not emitting anywhere near the same amount as those living in cities.

so o'toole did exactly what he had to do to win the leadership. i know for a fact that had poilievre run in 2020 and campaigned as the centre-right candidate, o'toole would have positioned himself to the left of mackay. that was delorey's plan. is that disingenuous as hell? god yes. but it's also the only way to stop candidates like scheer from winning.

people have to come to grips with the fact that the conservatives will eventually return to power. don't know when, don't know who, but they will. when it happens, i vastly prefer an o'toole, or a mackay, or an ambrose, or a raitt, or a chong, to a scheer or a poilievre. 

want to make sure this country doesn't get fucked when the conservatives take back government? start voting in their leadership races. seriously. more conservatives are progressive conservative than any other wing of the party, but there's not enough of them to override the combined votes of the social conservatives and right wingers, which is why o'toole won and not mackay. pushing the conservative party firmly to the centre will force other parties to shift as well and we might start making some progress on good policy.",conservatives

hace752,2021-08-25T07:22:41.000-07:00,"trudeau promises to hike taxes on canada’s big banks, insurance companies whoa take breather there bud, went pretty up in arms there over some questions.

as for the statement of how banks react to increased taxes - not my just my opinion, actually from a couple studies, one a fdic study done in 2013 (albeit about the usa, seems very comparable) titled \"how financial institutions react to tax increases\", another from bbva titled \"macroeconomic effects of taxes on banking\", and some others. all suggest that banks react to higher taxes by increasing their markups and by transferring part of the fiscal cost to households and firms through higher interest rates on loans. the increase in government revenues comes at a cost of a long-run decrease of gdp, an increase in loans interest rates, and a reduction in the volume of credit, deposits and bank capital. another study done by nyu titled \"taxation and the financial sector\" suggests financial institutions compensate for increased taxes with riskier investments - riskier investments by banks is usually bad (see 2008 financial crisis). have you got some studies done that suggest increased taxes on banks result in less costs to households?

i'm not a 'concerned troll', i actually work for a canadian financial institution analyzing data, and i know as soon as financial institution see increased costs anywhere, they begin exploring avenues of how to offset that increased cost to them.

i guess my question to you would be: what do you think the banks responses would be increased taxes? if they're not going to 'pass the expense onto consumers through fees' do you think they'll just accept the profit loss and move on?

as for corporations/rich paying less tax, lets clarify. they pay less tax as a *percentage of their income*. in *absolute dollars* (the money coming in) they still pay way way more. if an individual making an income of $80,000 is taxed at 28% and a corporation making $5,000,000 is taxed at 10%, the corp is still paying more  ($22,400 vs. $500,000). when it comes to government spending, they look at real dollars being spent.

hcg2z8b,2021-09-11T01:47:41.000-07:00,"four of the five federal parties commit to supporting news media, and increased funding for cbc/radio-canada obviously, just about everything you’ve said here is wrong. you’re basically confusing the criteria for losing a lawsuit with the criteria for that suit being a slapp. they are not the same thing, and your argument is essentially refuted by the court’s statement that i’ve already quoted, but will repeat for emphasis:

&gt;\\[55\\] the cbc, as a state owned enterprise, is being reasonable in its concern to neither be nor appear to be politically partisan. it is unfair to allege, as the respondents do, that the adverse impacts arise from its commencing this litigation. there is no evidence to support the accusation that cbc is acting irrationally in protecting its rights. to do otherwise is to open it to a catch 22 situation of being accused of favouring a party if it did not exert its rights against them and criticized as partisan when it does assert its rights.

if it is reasonable to bring a suit, then it is not a slapp, because the defining characteristic of a slapps is that it has no basis to be brought other than to consumer the other party’s resources and discourage them from a further, legal course of action, such as voicing criticism, and therefore it is otherwise unreasonable to bring.

by your logic, virtually every lawsuit is a slapp, because there usually a loser that the court decides is wrong. that’s not how any of this works.

that is the major point on which you are wrong, and is a theme throughout your incorrect comment, but i’ll address the further specific points below.

&gt;broadly, could the cbc have legitimate concerns? absolutely, but these concerns were absolutely spurious.

the court said that *these* concerns were reasonable. the court *never* said these concerns were spurious. you can’t quote the court in support of your claim because the court did not say them but, rather, said the opposite.

&gt;further i have not misrepresented the suit, while there were other clips that cbc sued over (the news roundup which contained clips from cbc general programs) it also objected to the cbc posting a clip of their own leader speaking at the debate.

i presume you mean “*cpc* posting a clip,” otherwise this makes no sense. (or, rather, even less sense than usual.)

you have misrepresented the suit. you misrepresented it by cherry picking from it. there were nine disputed clips, five of which—i.e. the majority—did not include scheer speaking at the debate. you have attempted, and are still attempting, to make it seem like the cbc was suing the cpc over showing clips “of their own leader”. when your comments exclude the majority of instances, and act as if the minority of them were the only ones, that is misrepresenting the facts.

&gt;it is patently absurd for the national broadcaster to sue someone for posting a clip of the national leadership debate.

see? you just did it again.

&gt;it is enshrined in law that it is fair use. the cbc knows it is enshrined in law as fair use.

cite the law that enshrines it, then. you cannot, because it does not exist. firstly, “fair use” is an american legal doctrine. american law does not apply to canada. you’re not even in the right jurisdiction. “fair *dealing*” is the canadian doctrine. 

secondly, no, no “enshrinement” of fair dealing states that it applies to “posting a clip of the national leadership debate”. again, cite that law if you disagree. rather, fair dealing includes a six-factor test that involves the purpose, character, amount, and effect of the dealing, the existence of alternatives, and the nature of the work, all of which involve judgement calls that reasonable people can disagree on. indeed, in the decision, the court finds that the conservative party of canada failed on the “character” factor, and the “alternatives” factor was neutral. the court could have gone the other way. again, the court emphasized, “the cbc’s concern for its neutrality is reasonable. the role of the cbc itself has been a political topic. there may be situations in the future where the manner of use and distribution of cbc material may adversely affect the cbc”.

you claim it was patently absurd. the court says it was entirely reasonable. guess whose opinion matters more.

&gt;the cbc sued the cpc for no other reason than partisanship. notably they did not sue anyone else who posted clips. it showed that at the top of the cbc was a willingness to use public funds to go after political grudges. how does that not also impugn their editorial decision making?

none of that is true, for the reasons already cited.

&gt;notably they did not sue anyone else who posted clips.

who else posted which clips? cite sources. i’m not interested in your unsubstantiated claims.

&gt;there was no chance of the cbc winning and their claims were absolutely in bad faith which was stated by every single legal commenter who wrote on the topic.

who? cite them. again, the court disagrees with you, so i very much doubt that “every single legal commenter” did the same.

&gt;hence, slapp suit. sure, they didn't engage in forum shopping. that's about all you can say to defend that asinine suit.

and yet here i and the federal court of canada are saying so much more. i guess you’re wrong again.

&gt;you understand that describes the first tweet completely right?

i already explained that. you were cherry-picking. that’s misrepresenting.

&gt;hardly a resounding defence of cbc's claim.

i didn’t claim that the cbc won the case. obviously it didn’t. i claimed it wasn’t a slapp, and it wasn’t. again, this is your core misunderstanding. every lawsuit with a loser involves a court decision holding that one or more legal and/or factual claims by the losing party is wrong. by your logic, every lawsuit with a loser is therefor a slapp. that is not even remotely how it works.

&gt;think about that initial claim, cbc wanted the conservative party to be bound by what cbc thinks it should say, how it should say it, when it can say it, all in furtherance of the cbc's agenda.

that is absolutely not what the cbc requested. sorry, but the words matter.

&gt;but i guess i needed to take time to debunk your false information that this was somehow justified.

probably not as much time as i’ve (sadly) needed to take to debunk your false information. i went and actually cited things related to my points in mine.",conservatives

here's michael geist: https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2019/10/what-was-the-cbc-thinking-a-closer-look-at-the-clips-in-its-copyright-lawsuit-against-the-conservative-party/

&gt;beyond the strategic blunder, cbc’s legal arguments are very weak. the conservatives considered a copyright amendment in 2014 that would have created an exception for political parties to use news clippings. i argued then that it was unnecessary since fair dealing would cover reasonable uses without the need for permission from broadcasters. the conservatives ultimately dropped the idea, but fair dealing remains in place. in fact, the supreme court of canada just issued a ruling last month that again strongly affirmed users’ rights and the need for balance in copyright. 

go ahead find someone who thinks the cbc had an even chance to win.

what you're failing to recognize is the way quebec culture works also. regardless of stripe people in quebec are happy to be quebecois. it's a sort of pseudo ethnicity in a way. 

so calling quebec racist isn't just a comment on its legal system or it as an entity in and of itself, it's a comment on each person in quebec. in a way that isn't reflected in english canada. when she it was implied that quebec is racist she may have been thinking of systems. the people of quebec thought of individuals. and the older generations remember when english canada discriminated against *them* so it double sucks and stings and pulls all the wrong strings when phrased that way. 

the bloc exists because people worry that english canada will go back to ignoring their cultural differences and telling quebec what's good for them. so opening a national debate, in english, asking if they are racist to the bloc leader when most bloc maybe voters have a victim complex rooted in history is not the play.

[...] honestly, i cannot tell you how many people have told me they are experts on this doctrine since this snc-lavalin story broke. what has always been crystal clear to me – at that moment and throughout – is exactly what my role was as the attorney-general. in the pm’s description and questioning it was clear he had talked to others. i remarked, “you have been talking to a lawyer.”

i'm not an expert myself, but i tend to think that a lawyer might well qualify as an expert, in one degree or another, as an actual expert on the law (and, presumably, the doctrine, if they're that sort of lawyer). despite what jwr thinks, she's not the sole authority on the law in this country. especially not when the question at hand is murky and experts might disagree. 

i mean think about it. imagine jwr was your doctor, and she gives you a diagnosis-- and you go to another doctor to get a second opinion. upon returning to her, she accuses you of seeing another doctor, which is a 'bad thing' to do, instead of trusting her completely. it may be that this second doctor is wrong and jwr was right all along, but seeking out a second opinion from another doctor really isn't a bad thing-- its only a bad thing if the 'second doctor' is unqualified or a quack (see: covid-19), but disagreeing isn't the same thing as being unqualified. 

does this look good for trudeau? of course not. but reading this feels like jwr is inadvertently exposing the same aspects of her personality that we saw in the heat of the scandal. it's what drove her to release a secret recording she had made without recognizing the unethical nature of that act or the fact that she doesn't come off looking particularly good for doing so.",liberals

please quote the court saying that this was a “spurious” suit. i know you can’t, because i’ve word-searched it for that and it’s not there. but maybe there’s a synonym for it or the like that you have in mind. then quote that. but, for the umpteenth time, a claim that fails in court and a claim that is spurious are not the same thing. you’re going around and around in the same circle.

h2kano8,2021-06-21T04:17:47.000-07:00,"canadian unions break with trudeau &gt; if a employer knows that all they have to do is wait for the government to come in a force people back to work, then the union never had any ground to negotiate on. the existence of the mere threat of back to work legislation is a giant unbalancing of the power dynamics between worker run unions and their capital controlled employer. it in self is the means to an end.

this is getting a bit into the weeds on negotiating theory, but i think it's erroneous to assume that strikes are the _only_ way that unions exert bargaining power.

&gt; they dynamics of choosing a mediator is also a unbalancing of the whole process because they have to be mutually agree upon.

that's not the common practice with back-to-work legislation; if the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, the relevant minister will select one.

&gt;  it means that no mediator is going to ever do more than cut the baby in half.

that's also not necessarily the practice with imposed arbitration.  bill c-29 allows for interest arbitration, but prior legislation has sometimes imposed final-offer arbitration.  with final-offer arbitration, there's necessarily no baby-slicing.

&gt; it assume that both sides are valid. sometimes there are real problems with working conditions only one side is advocating for health and safety the other is always arguing for the bottom line.

in that case, where one side is obviously right, it seems like final-offer arbitration would naturally select the common-sense terms.

&gt; if large nationally important businesses can't be ground to a halt by workers than what is the union going to use as leverage.

it's the \"nationally important\" part that's the problem.  a strike that imposes costs on the workers (lost wages) and business (lost profits) is \"fair\" in a normal sense.  

but when the strike also imposes real costs on the economy as a whole (e.g. delayed mail delivery), that's an additional set of victims.  these \"nationally important businesses\" can't be easily replaced by their very nature, so customers and the public at large are also harmed with no direct way to intervene in the dispute.

that turns a strike from a private dispute to one impacting public order.  and in that vein, we already have ample history behind \"never strike\" industries.  the uniformed military for example can never go on strike by its very nature, and i believe that our jurisdictions have applied similar restrictions to other public health and safety matters like fire departments and police forces.

&gt; the liberals are great at marketing themselves as for the working class so they cyphen of soft left vote away for a more truely populist option while then turning around and stabbing those voters in the back.

another reading of this is that the canadian public is a lot more ambivalent about this than union organizers would prefer, especially when it comes to services that impact said public.

look at this empirically: if labour rights as described here were so popular, then back to work or other union-hostile legislation would be so risky that the \"transactional\" liberal party would never touch it.",liberals

since the decision was rendered in 2016, it was the liberal government that had to decide whether or not to appeal it.  to the extent the decision was political, i think it's evidence that the liberals are not keen on \"punitive\" back-to-work legislation.

i have just finished reading through the document. i have to admit, it's over 80 pages so i've skimmed a lot of it, but i've spent a good hour or two reading through it now. it is very much what i expected from the liberal party of canada and from a government that is 6 years into their mandate. a lot of it, which i was expecting to be quite frank, was expansions or broadening of currently existing programs.

i found they put *a lot* of emphasis on race, gender, and diversity throughout the document, and even had a race and gender impact assessment after most sections. this struck me as something different the liberals did compared to others. it is very apparent the liberals are trying to do their best, or at least appear to do their best, at doing things more *intersectionally.*

what's more, this platform is also designed to grab that left-wing and abc vote. there isn't very much within this platform that appeals to me as a conservative.

will this work? time will tell, they'll have to sell it to canadians, and tomorrow, explain to quebeckers why they want to impose more federal government on us which is expressly outside of françois legault's request. pm trudeau and the liberals have made it clear with this platform that the requests of legault and the québec government will not be met by the liberals. québec nationalists, the liberal party is not your party.

i also want to add that a lot of what's in the platform could have been implemented in a minority situation with the help of the ndp. why did we need this election for this? pm justin trudeau and the liberals will have to answer this.

look into the specifics of the latest bans and yeah, i don’t trust this guy to actually do anything for the good of canadians. trudeau knows the average canadian doesn’t know much about guns and will just throw taxpayer money at the issue which won’t do anything once an inevitable cpc government legalises the guns again. why am i to believe that trudeau will do better on environmentalism, an issue i know less about? sure, he can give me assurances that we have great goals, and no more pipelines for sure this time. but i know he’s a liar in the topics i’m knowledgable in, so i’ve no reason to trust the liberals. if it’s so easy to make evidence-based policy, why haven’t they tried it? not like cpc is any better but they are not out there campaigning on lies regarding firearms.

full disclosure, i don’t own any guns, neither do i shoot guns. i stand nothing to lose from a gun ban. but guns are a wedge issue that is easy to spot and judge candidates by. like how the leader of the bloc gave a speech the other day saying trudeau gave in to the gun lobby regarding “assault weapons” ban. yeah, which lobby, company or person? of course he can’t name one, it’s yet another lie, trying to make trudeau look not gun grabby enough. it’s ridiculous. both of them pushing useless laws then talking shit about who’s doing more to protect the children.

&gt;	both the federal government and the bank of canada has policy that effects inflation yes. and cpi does look at housing, of course it does, it just doesn’t focus on housing as an asset compared to housing as a cost to your budget. you know, what you’re supposed to be looking at for what the price of living and what the cost of a good is. asset price inflation is just plain not inflation, its just not what the word means.

“inflation is the rate at which the value of a currency is falling.”

if the same house costs more tomorrow then it did yesterday how is that not inflation?

&gt;	likewise, if the issue was inflationary policies, rather than an issue with one sector, you’d see inflationary effects across the board. we very much are not. 

look at any asset class, collectables, housing, equities, crypto anything with scarcity, the dollar is absolutely plunging compared to then. yeah our supply chains are somewhat healthy keeping groceries and clothes in relative check and wages are stagnant.

&gt;neither is the dollar tanking in price nor is the government of canada having any real difficulty finding purchasers of their debt issues even at low rates of return.

lmfao only because the central bank is buying it all. stop the billions a week in bond purchases and lets see how high rates for that debt go.

&gt;	btw, none of the stuff i’m talking about is mmt anything, and the government of canada hasn’t been pursuing mmt policies at any point. they’ve been doing fairly standard neo-keynesian policies during unusual conditions. these were prudent policies to have during the crisis, which is why the economy appears to be in a position to rebound to previous conditions whenever pandemic conditions justify reopening.

for me its more a matter of 'a lot of parts of the government are inefficient because the government as a whole is slow and reluctant to upgrade any technology that it uses'. like it doesn't need to be constantly at the cutting edge but it often seems like most of the government is barely out of the 90s. the private sector isn't any better, many companies are very change averse and end up missing out on large amounts of efficient solutions to things.

the frequent calls for ubi to replace numerous government services is a great example. the only way it ends up not working out math wise is when people (disingenuously) act like it would get payed out to everyone regardless of income. any reading about it beyond just looking at the name would disabuse people of those notions but ahh people don't like to read. its 'always' paired up with some sort of clawback rate or income cap or both. or it ends up being a similar system based on having negative tax rates, there are lots of ways to get there.

having a system like that replace welfare, disability, old age, and family payouts and merging their respective work forces end up costing the same or less than we currently spend on those respective services and streamline it all for users and the government and tax systems.

similar with my example of a coherent government it program. every single piece of news that comes out about our governments it infrastructure is basically terrible. its ancient, has terrible security, gets hacked regularly, breaks all the time, and is handled differently at every single government location across the country. there are so many ways that could be handled better, and they would all likely end up being cheaper and better in the long run.

see i'm not talking about fiscal cutting for cuttings sake, and i'm not talking about blithly looking for inefficiencies. it has to be a big picture overhaul of systems with a focus on things that actually work and are supported by data and modern technological practices. basically i want the government to modernize and by doing so become more efficient at the things its supposed to do. it has decades of inertia carrying it into the future backwards from a technology perspective and it only gets harder to fix the problem the further it goes.",conservatives

one is way more likely and happens way more often than the other. if you took today's aberrant weather and said the government caused it with a weather machine, even though engineering weather is a documented phenomenon, you would have to provide evidence since weather occurs naturally all the time.

&gt; or maybe...there always was evidence and the media over-reacted.

there's no maybes here, if these conspiracy theorists had evidence they would show it. the fact that secondhand circumstantial evidence has triggered investigations and support from world leaders should tell you there's no conspiracy because as soon as any shred of even possibly legitimate evidence was brought to light, people started taking it very seriously very fast.

&gt; anyways, it sounds like you've set up this non-falsifiable claim. like, even if the media is eventually dead wrong, they were still \"right\" back then, and there's no way to convince you otherwise.

no, it's very easily falsifiable. all you would have to do is show the conspiracy nuts had evidence before this new report was revealed and that it was not reported on. luckily articles and webpages are dated so it shouldn't be so hard since those conspiracy theories were so widespread.

&gt; to me, it is clear that there was over-confidence given the vast amount of uncertainty that existed. it's totally ok to say \"we don't know\" and the media didn't do that.

this is a very different claim from the one you started with about people shutting up discussions by saying \"trust the science\". the broad consensus has always been natural spread from an animal and the media has generally presented it like that while saying a lab leak was unlikely. you're welcome to go verify that. easier way would be to google something like \"covid origins\" and then add \"before:yyyy-mm-dd\" to get dates before this new report came out. if you check before may, most news reports focus on the april who report that said a lab leak was unlikely. if you go before that it's similar speculation. can you tell me how this is unfair reporting? how is pointing to likely and unlikely origins as reported and speculated on by many scientists not saying \"we don't know\"?

here's some articles:

*  [nbc in february. the headline: \"u.s. still hasn't ruled out lab accident origin for covid because china hasn't been transparent\" ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1258032)

* [ctv in december 2020. headline: scientists find new clues, but origin of covid-19 still a mystery.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/national/coronavirus/2020/12/1/1_5211636.html) quote from the article: 'while simon-loriere said it was not yet possible to completely rule out the idea that the virus escaped accidentally, he stressed that there was \"no indication it was manmade\".'

* [global in january. headline: who team to research covid-19 origins in wuhan. here’s what we know. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/7604579/covid-origins-world-health-organization/amp/) quote from the article: 'the team may visit the market itself as well as the locations of other early cases.
it could also go to a laboratory at the wuhan institute of virology that was built after the 2003 sars pandemic and maintains an extensive archive of genetic sequences of bat coronaviruses. u.s. officials in the previous trump administration suggested without offering evidence that the virus could have escaped from the institute.
experts say it’s unlikely that the new coronavirus emerged from the lab in wuhan and overwhelmingly say analysis of the new coronavirus’s genome rules out the possibility that it was engineered by humans.'



so i have to ask, why are you making up a false narrative of media bias and cover up where none exists?

&gt; i'm quite alright with admitting that that literal and specific phrase wasn't used often.

weird that you'd call it a catchphrase then. 

&gt; the sentiment was though. 

ah the \"sentiment\", eh? just conveniently vague enough to be completely unfalsifiable.",liberals

then there is the second category of refugees, but they are more accurately called “asylum seekers”. they are not in the same lineup at all as the first kind. these are people who arrive in canada and ask for canada’s protection. it is part of our international obligation to provide asylum to legitimate cases of people in need of protection. these people get hearings to discover if they really need canada’s protection. they all start at the back of the line and are allowed to wait in canada for their hearing (as it’s unknown at that point if they can go back home again). in rare cases, if some people are considered possibly dangerous while they await an asylum hearing, they are held in detention. 

tldr: two types of refugees. those that are resettled and those that claim asylum. they do not share the same lineup.
