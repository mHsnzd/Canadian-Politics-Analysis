i'm personally opposed to it because of the crtc being completely captured by our telecom oligarchy, and see this as the ndp being unwilling to stand up to the liberals out of fear of triggering an election. 

the point is that canadians never asked for it. you can already find all the canadian content you want on the industry, and if the bill started and stopped at \"providing increased funding for canadian-made-media by increasing taxes on large corportations\", but that's not what bill c-10 is. 

bill c-10 is about giving the crtc the mandate to regulate internet media like they can for broadcasting, which is not a requirement if your goal is to promote canadian content. in fact, it's highly likely to have the opposite effect, limiting any kind of grassroots canadian content by requiring anyone with any sort of audience to register with the crtc.

anyone with any kind of knowledge of how the crtc works knows that the only people this is going to help are large canadian media and telecom companies, who already soak up the vast majority of media funding in this country and gatekeep from anyone outside of their bubble.

gpasgo9,2021-02-28T22:03:12.000-08:00,"under trudeau, canada is saudi arabia’s most dedicated gunrunner so first, i didn’t know about that hitler fallacy. thank you for pointing that out. 
that being said, my argument doesn’t fall into that fallacy. according to the definition from your link and i quote 
“reductio ad hitlerum is a form of association fallacy.[6][7] the argument is that a policy leads to—or is the same as—one advocated or implemented by adolf hitler or the third reich and so \"proves\" that the original policy is undesirable.”

my argument has nothing to do with a policy advocated or implemented by hitler, rather i am associating selling weapons to human rights violators with selling weapons to hitler who was also a gross human rights violator. so i respectfully point out that your accusation of my argument falling into reducto ad hitlerism (lol love the name) is incorrect.

secondly, i despise harper deeply. that does not take away from the fact that the liberals did not cancel a contract harper made to sell weapons to human rights violators. does the evil of cancelling a contract outweigh supplying weapons to a regime known to commit human rights violations using it ? would we have done this if we had a similar contract with hitler ? 

lastly, the argument that we need to hold our agreements to have a voice in dialogue is absurd. so essentially you’re saying we should continue to send weapons we know are being used in yemen because we’re scared of china saying “you didn’t supply weapons to be used in genocide, even though you promised you would. now your word means nothing”. 

if anything our word would mean more if we took a brave stand against human rights consistently.",liberals

next, the harper government knew exactly who the saudi’s were when they inked that deal.  we already threw human rights out the window when the deal was made.  whatever damage to our reputation this deal caused was made then.

next i have already explained why we need to honour our agreements made to ensure that our word means something which is important to canada right now with the meng wenzhou case.

and lastly, there is also [the massive punitive damages canada would face for cancelling the agreement which is reported to be in the billions](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/penalty-for-cancelling-saudi-arms-contract-in-the-billions-trudeau-1.4150003) to consider.

so we are damned if we do give arms to the saudi’s and damned if we don’t and then have to give the saudi’s billions in compensation which they can use to fund terrorist organizations, and then they also get to say canada doesn't honour their agreements, and should be ignored when they squawk about human rights.

from the article:

&gt;members  of the ontario covid-19 science  advisory table said there are three  policies that mr. ford could enact  immediately that would save lives:  the increased redirection of vaccines  to covid-19 hot spots,  particularly in the greater toronto area; the  provision of paid sick  days; and a narrower definition of an essential  business  
the   globe and mail spoke with more than half a dozen members of the   advisory table during the weekend and all expressed dismay with the   government’s actions. several say they considered resigning in protest,   but feared the move would only worsen the government’s next steps.  
peter   juni, the scientific director of the table, said he was “at a loss”   trying to understand why the provincial government announced a suite of   measures that didn’t account for his group’s advice.  
nathan  stall, a physician and the  assistant scientific director of the  table’s secretariat, said he was  dumbfounded by the government’s  rejection of science and common sense.  
andrew   morris, an infectious-disease specialist and also a member of the   table, said his reaction friday was a mixture of shock, disbelief, anger   and sadness.  
alison thompson, a   member of the ontario covid-19 health system response bioethics table,   another group advising the ford government, said she and her colleagues   were stunned, especially by the absence of enhanced protections for   essential workers.  
“it was probably one of the lowest points in my career. it was hard not to quit,” dr. thompson said.  
dr.   morris added the government’s small steps to correct themselves during   the weekend shouldn’t distract from their failure to implement the   policies that could alleviate the crisis.  
“we need a government that will listen to science,” dr. morris said.  
behavioural   scientist laura desveaux, a member of the science table, said she felt   angry and deflated to learn of the measures on friday.  
“i   started to reflect on what were the restrictions that were announced   and, benefit of the doubt, how could that link back to the evidence that   was presented? and some of it clearly didn’t,” she said.

also, with the fractured roll out with a myriad of portals to navigate, it can be quite difficult for people who are esl or who are not well connected and experienced with our system to get vaccines.

however, redirecting vaccines seems like a weak use of the emergency powers act. there are sensible uses of the act that bear considering, such as an actual mandatory mask rule and enforcement thereof and stricter rules, enforcements or even shutdowns of opc darlings in the construction, warehousing and big box retail sectors. the ondp has called for the broader shutdowns in line with medical experts, so its odd that singh is not referring to those demands in his letter. it's also disappointing that the ondp won't call for an actual enforceable mask mandate with teeth.",liberals

the main reason is that one of the defence minister's main jobs is to keep the military accountable for following the law and not doing anything evil. senior military commanders (not all of them, but often) have a tendency to have a black-and-white view of things ... i mean, when they've spent most of their lives planning how to kill people in enemy countries, they develop a certain way of seeing things that might tempt them to justify doing sketchy or illegal stuff. so these experts think it's best to have someone who's not from that world to say \"hey no, that's crossing the line\".

for an extreme example, in japan, there used to be a law that defence ministers *had* to be military commanders; in the 1930s, these ministers started becoming essentially spies for the army that would blackmail the prime minister into doing what the army wanted (like, they'd literally say \"do what we want or else i'll sabotage all your cabinet meetings and policies\"). eventually, a few ministers got assassinated, and the army straight up took over running the country, started a war with the us (which none of the civilian politicians they took over from wanted), and it all ended up with the country being literally nuked to death.

naming a civilian as defence minister is essentially a way of making sure the person is going to be the people's voice to the army, not the other way around.

&gt; with logic like yours maybe the surgeon general shouldn't be a doctor or the attorney general shouldn't be a lawyer.

those jobs aren't equivalent. the attorney general's job is to lead the federal government's law department and strategize for court cases and so on, so yes that person should be a lawyer. the defence minister's job is *not* commanding military campaigns (that's what generals do), it's more like supervising the generals to make sure they're being good law-abiding people. 

putting a former military commander as defence minister is more like putting a former executive of bell or rogers to run the crtc (and be in charge of regulating bell and rogers).

\\* although it's quickly becoming a dead law, the last two presidents both nominated a former military commander (trump -&gt; gen. mattis, biden -&gt; gen. austen) as defence minister and asked congress to pass a new law making an exception.",liberals

&gt;ans honestly it is rrally funny that you say aggravate china, when breaking the treaty wiuld aggravate the us far more and be far more damaging to canada. 

stop saying break the treaty. i'm not talking about abrogating the treaty. i've read the treaty, and the *extradition act.* you understand that we can refuse to extradite without abrogating the treaty, and that cases like this are *exactly* why the final decision is with the minister of immigration, not the judge?

in any case while it would have aggravated the us, they would have understood our position perfectly. but freeland came into office promising an \"america first\" policy, so we chose instead to further entrench our international standing as an american lapdog who harms our own relations with other countries at america's request.

&gt;i nwver said anything about sanctions being right or wrong. only legal or illegal. and lying about ignoring them to a bank is also illegal. and it is also illegal to lie to the bank to get a loan in canada. hence the extradition.

thanks for laying out the prosecution's case for me, though i am familiar with it. matters of law are rarely black and white, however.

&gt;it's funny how everyone is so anti-white collar crime, but now that china is doing it we should just let it go.

i am not in favour of aggressively punishing any kind of crime purely for the sake of justice. i am not a justice hawk. but neither is anybody else. if we want to crack down on white collar crime we should start with tax evasion in canada, and maybe consider that this particular prosecution is obviously politically motivated and not done out of concern for the poor defrauded hsbc. to believe that officials in either canada or america were motivated primarily by a commitment to upholding the law here is absurd, don't you think? be real.",liberals

however, sloan's comments were not acceptable nor are any other racist remarks and i am glad o'toole took a strong stand and booted him.

i am very cautious around the framing of such statements as it quickly boils down to unconscious xenophobia, there is nothing wrong with hiring nationals or companies from other parts of the world. the lpc had hired a plethora of obama-biden and democratic campaign strategists, no reason the cpc could not do the same.

as for mortality rate? i said nothing about mortality. that was unclear on my part. 
my point is that the % of efficacy vs recovery is only 2%. we have learned to deal better with the treatment of the infected. so the death rate has dropped more than significantly. 
your comment about the “pfizer vaccine being 94% effective at preventing asymptomatic infections and 97% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, severe disease and death” 
“asymptomatic” refers to “not exhibiting symptoms”. so i read that the vaccine is effective at reducing symptoms being exhibited. 
“effective in preventing symptomatic symptoms” reads to me that it is effective in preventing “symptoms” of disease, severe disease and death. 

my comments and information do not come from only one site/ article. some of the percentages i have provided are an “on average” percentile. (i feel i even gave the upper percentile in favour of the vaccine reports)

from the site i sent you. 
“how long does protection from a covid-19  vaccination last?”
“we don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. what we do know is that covid-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. if you get covid-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. getting a covid-19 vaccine is a safer choice”
my point here is that the cdc is not sure as to how long the vaccine will last. 
“experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. cdc will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.”

it also recommends that if you are vaccinated ,”until more is known, fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from other people in other settings, like when they are in public or visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households.” 
this tells me that the spread of disease is still possible even if you are vaccinated. 
another source 
https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison

as for your comment, “take it or leave it “ that is my original point here. i reserve the right to chose to take it or leave it. a person should not be mandated or restricted because of their choice not to participate in something that is still so unclear. 
i feel personally, if i am healthy, active, diligent and at low risk, why should i be forced to be injected with something that is still not 100% conclusive for its efficacy long term, for all variants, and without long term potential unwanted effects?

personally i wish all of us good health and good luck.

here you place an offer at listing price, say `$700,000` as in your example, with a specific deadline and all the various required info / clauses / contingencies, and an earnest money cheque.

one of those clauses can be an escalation clause.  it has two values on it:

- you're willing to go over anyone else's offer by example `$5,000`
- up to a maximum of example `$775,000`

for this to trigger i believe (but am not entirely certain how it works) the sellers realtor needs to come back with proof (possibly redacted, or only shown to your realtor for privacy concerns) of another offer received recently still within it's deadline.

i never actually had mine trigger, and was able to get a place for asking price, so i'm not entirely certain how it works but i think it's a good idea in theory.",liberals

does the ndp need to do a better job in communicating this? absolutely. but i don’t know how to convince someone that hundreds of years of oppression and discrimination (overt and unconscious) needs something more that words to overcome. i can’t teach a masterclass on race, privilege, and empathy. and i don’t know how to get through to people who think that removing systemic discrimination is somehow a bad thing. 

we need much broader education on systemic issues that certain people are still, in 2021, refusing to learn about. you can pin this on the ndp but all of society is moving this way - even the conservatives pay lip service to it in between their dog whistles.

all i can say is if you believe in workers rights, those rights have to extend to everyone. 

&gt; your comment about white men disproportionately making up top jobs is exactly the kind of talk that leaves the impression that the ndp see it as something that needs fiximg

it is something that needs fixing!!! how can you think it’s ok for just white men to be in charge of everything?

if this is your priority i don’t know what to tell you - you are not pro-workers rights if you don’t think your fellow workers deserve full participation in our society.

&gt; your equality is being interpreted as less whites

that is a hefty projection and is embodying the sentiment of that quote. people who think that equality means “less whites” need to get over themselves. it’s not always about you - you need to let other people participate too. it’s not a zero sum game.

edit: and let me clarify - i’m not calling worker concerns imaginary. those are real. i am saying their belief that it is women, or bipoc, or lgbtq+ causing those concerns is imaginary - it is the corporations and capital class causing the problems, not the poor immigrant just trying to make a living.",conservatives

ha7zf5t,2021-08-24T08:44:16.000-07:00,"john ivison: lessons from a heckler on trudeau's six years of failed promises of affordable housing this \"6 years\" narrative that has taken hold is either a poorly informed meme or an attempt to manipulate voters using social media. frankly, the fact that the np is running it makes me suspicious that it's not coordinated in some way.

so i'll remind again: we had an election during the past 6 years, 2019 in fact. housing/cost of living was not a key issue during the 2019 election. it was barely on anyone's radar, and not part of any political platform in any serious way. something like only 17% of millennials (ages 18-34) saw it as the most important issue. housing then was at best a highly regional problem and not a national issue. people from owen sound to halifax did not care about toronto/vancouver's woes (\"let those cities/provinces solve their own problems,\" they said). just look back at the stats/issues from the 2019 election.

it's only emerged as a national issue (or at least, having an incredibly large geographic sweep) in the past 15 months where the byproducts of covid-19 has resulted in a housing and affordability surge. some of those were from steps designed to keep the economy from tanking, and therefore... people from losing their jobs (or the homes they do have). i also use emerge intentionally; the reality of the situation we face with housing didn't suddenly blow up in march/april 2020, we only come to realize how bad things were getting over the months that followed.

so yeah, this narrative? it's incredibly disingenuous to claim \"they've had 6 years\". this is just misinformation and trying (intentionally or not) to re-write history. might as well blame harper, or obama.",liberals

ignatieff is a bit of an outlier. his era of lpc fuelled progressive voters to jump ship, initially voting for layton's ndp and subsequently considering mulcair's ndp (as shown in early polling) before trudeau finally turned things around and won 2015. admittedly though, i was young in the 1990s and didn't follow politics as closely.

regardless, i feel that discussions about progressive vote splitting are too often misplaced. when parties merge, instead of combining their bases, they often struggle to maintain their big tent identities. early success (e.g. harper's cpc or kenney's ucp) can be followed by alienating voters away, even spawning offshoot parties (e.g. bernier's ppc). ultimately, parties cannot take individual voters for granted.",liberals

arguing against an electoral system based on your preferred outcome is blatantly anti-democratic.

there's only one real test of any system: does it effectively reflect the will of the electorate?  to that end, i prefer ranked ballots, because it reflects the reality that most voters aren't partisan and have preferences, including a rank ordering of who they'd vote for.  if a more partisan approach is preferred, mmp works to balance the seats to reflect the vote.   

i'm not actually convinced that a different system might substantially advantage the liberals, any more than first-past-the-post helps them through higher vote efficiency today.  whatever the new system, parties will change campaign practices.  in any ranked system, for example, there's substantial value in even appealing to be everybody's number 2.  so the cpc would win many suburban ridings by appealing to liberal moderates to put them number 2.",liberals

&gt;[ultimately, however, the greatest problem with handgun bans is they violate the principle that canadians should not be deprived of preexisting rights without rational, evidence-based reasons for doing so. advocates of gun control often argue—correctly—that the canadian constitution does not protect the right to own firearms. this attitude is reflected in public safety minister bill blair’s recent comment that gun ownership in canada is “a privilege, not a right.” characterizing rights as privileges sets a troubling precedent, however, as the constitution is equally silent on most activities canadians enjoy, many of which are more dangerous than responsible firearm ownership. our rights to make our own choices are not favours granted by government, even when those choices lack explicit constitutional protection. in a tolerant society such as canada’s, citizens should have the freedom to pursue whatever interests they enjoy, unless the government can reasonably argue that their actions pose a danger to others. with respect to owning handguns, the government has not made its case.](https://www.nationalmagazine.ca/en-ca/articles/law/opinion/2021/irrational-lawmaking?fbclid=iwar0toycwjxyjfsh6xnso0ocz90198gn3fjz1lsjtgnl73ixmi63r_ddin_a)",liberals

yes, that means we are going to offend certain people. but that's exactly the point, we should implement integration programs to ensure that the people who are coming into this country aren't going to cry *racism* whenever we try to conserve our heritage. in norway, for example, they don't care which country you are from, if you don't complete their integration program and accept norwegian social values they are going to deport you.

it's also absurd to bring up the japanese concentration camps which was a *war time* measure. it was unfortunate that it occurred, but you have to remember that ww2 was an intense conflict. japanese spies were very much present in china, korea, the philippines, and in hawaii, and did in fact assist japanese soldiers and lead to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. japanese operatives were in conflict with american soldiers in the pacific coast. it was an unfortunate situation but it was not without reason. if you looked at it purely from a canadian perspective it seemed irrational but if you studied the war crimes the japanese soldiers committed in the places they invaded and occupied, it was a legitimate concern. compared to the european interventionists and colonists in asia, the japanese were brutal and horrific. the british occupation of india was heaven compared to the japanese occupation of manchuria and south-east asia.",conservatives

i have a beef with this interpretation, at least when its applied against liberal voters. 

i think there's a good degree of privilege involved in the ndp attitude of \"liberal or tory same old story,\" a privilege of people who are secure enough (or inexperienced enough) to hand-wave the \"minor\" differences between liberals and conservative parties of various stripes, because either the impact doesn't register or because its worth the pain if it helps the ndp's long march to power. 

a conservative victory this time around would have undone breakthrough funding agreements for universal childcare, a holy grail for progressive voters for decades, and a big deal for struggling lower income families. in 2006, we lost the kelowna accords, a critical step forward for first nations that stalled a lot of help for a decade, and tax cuts were used to create an appearance of fiscal desperation as a justification to cut social supports.

in ontario, the ford government removed critical inspectors from ltc homes, a move that lowered standards and put vulnerable, poor seniors in danger. he rolled back the liberals' youth pharmacare program. the minimum wage increase was stalled instead of increasing from $14 to $15 (and would not have even become that high if the tories had won the previous election). the free tuition for those whose parents made less than $50,000 was a boon to low income families that's been taken away to reduce fees for higher income earners. 

ndp voters have acted \"shocked\" and \"outraged\" when such things happen, and declare themselves appalled by conservative policies. i'm torn between dismissing this as insincere or taking their words for it and dismissing them as entitled when they say this stuff and then turn around and declare liberals and tories are the same. 

either this pain inflicted on the working class when liberal programs are stalled or scaled back is \"worth it\" to new democrats if it helps on the long march to power - a very privileged outlook, and an attitude they often ascribe to liberals, or they're really just so detached from reality that they don't notice the impact of minimum wage changes, pharma-care, tuition, transit freezes, changes in retirement age or other things where the liberals and tories disagree. 

i'm all in favour of people voting ndp, and it often makes a lot of sense as a matter of principle *and* as a matter of electoral strategy. i intend to vote ndp in the upcoming provincial election.

but i find the notion that its the strategic or principled federal liberal voters who are entitled and disinterested as supremely disingenuous. people who vote for liberal care about the ways conservative policies hurt ordinary people in the near term, and don't think that the long-game of someday for the ndp is worth the consequences people need to face in the meantime. that's not privileged, its compassionate and principled. 

i think 2006 and, especially, 2011 turned me off the federal ndp forever - watching crowds or ndp supporters party and celebrate a conservative majority government, only to turn around to scream about how its roll back of previous liberal policies were unmitigated disasters gave me severe whiplash i'm still recovering from.",liberals

he also said if you noticed that legion magazine article that he spoke with the ombudsman about changes.

what else did he know with regard to vance?!

i do also wonder since he is using that true patriot foundation as a funneling way to get money to other groups for raising money and it seems like a conflict of interest to get favour which is a deep conflict of interest.

he could have also silenced the high powered veterans groups over the veterans who suffered gravely under the harper government.

hillier being associated with o'toole helping to found the true patriot foundation tells me that there is more to the story than anything else because they both formed it. the harper government also had a good relationship with hillier and he never challenged any issue as cds.

everyone probably also knows all the people within that mood organization which got money from true patriot and even from the legion. i say that because true patriot appears to give money to everything and o'toole and hillier are well-connected in the military.

this does resemble the we charity because the conservatives post it all the time, get people from their committee for the party and it is no doubt used by the conservatives in almost every way possible as a promotion vehicle.

and yes how do they know who to fund?! how close as an elected official is o'toole to that organization?! he also is very strong with royal canadian legion and many other alma meters as noted on his bio page.

another huge issue is that true patriot foundation charity picks organizations and quite frankly wouldn't just pick organizations willy nilly. there must be standards and the legion also probably coordinates so one has to wonder why they chose that particular one and true patriot is very much tied to all the big military organizations.

“that’s what the ndp, the media and the federal liberals were looking for and want. we simply couldn’t allow that to happen.”

the truth is that the governments of the ucp and onpc have both bungled their pandemic responses at the expense of lives and livelihoods.  it's clear to see by anyone who actually cares to look. if justice exists in this country,  their will be consequences for their poor decisions. 

this statement contributes nothing positive to the crisis at hand, in fact it achieves the opposite by being divisive.

&gt; why would that happen exactly?

## transfusion transmitted infections (ttis)

first, because if you get a blood transfusion with hiv-infected blood, you have [a 92.5% chance of contracting hiv](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html). our bodies have a lot of defenses, and many of those are barriers such as skin and our skin even has enzymes on it to help kill viruses. but if you straight-up inject someone with a virus, unless your immune system already recognizes it, then you are probably going to be infected.

now, for a lot of this, i'm going to focus on hiv, but what is true for that is true for several other ttis. [according to the bccdc](http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/documents/guidelines%20and%20forms/guidelines%20and%20manuals/epid/cd%20manual/chapter%201%20-%20cdc/epid_gf_tti_june2004.pdf):

&gt; examples of known ttis include: hepatitis a, b, c, d and g, hiv, htlv i and ii, west nile virus, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and malaria. a tti may also result from new or emerging infectious agents, which are not known to be transmitted as a tti, but for which there is biologic plausibility of person-to-person transmission as a tti. such an example is the agent responsible for new variant creutzfeldt-jacob disease. 

that list is not exhaustive and there could also be new and emerging diseases -- think \"covid-19, but it's transmitted by blood\".  (luckily, [covid-19 isn't likely to be acquired via blood transfusion](https://www.blood.ca/en/stories/why-you-wont-get-covid-19-from-a-blood-transfusion).)

## factors that lead to contamination of the blood supply

because there are at least three sources of error with ensuring that blood is safe.

1. **human errors.** *i.e.* people make mistakes. lots of engineering controls go into ensuring that this is minimized, however human-caused errors still do happen. human errors tend to be unpredictable, so it's difficult to set a hard number on this.
2. **testing errors** *i.e.* false negative or [type ii errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_i_and_type_ii_errors); \"a guilty person is not convicted\". no test is perfect and sometimes a test will, for whatever reason, say \"no hiv/hcv/hbv detected\", even when some is present.
  * [example of a false negative rna test involving hiv](https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/55/12/3316.full.pdf)
  * [the same issue can occur with covid-19 tests](https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-021-01489-0)
3. **window periods**. *i.e.* a just-infected person has enough virus (e.g. hiv, hcv, or hbv usually, but also others) to transmit an infection, but *not enough to be detected using current techniques*.

the last item tends to have the largest effect, *given the current screening regime*. if the screening regime were to be changed, the others would play a larger role.

### window periods

an infection that occurs within the \"window period\" is likely going to evade all of the tests. we have no means of catching these infections outside of **screening** questionnaires. 

the window period means that the optimal strategy is to *minimize the number of people donating blood who are most likely to have recently become infected with a tti*. 

what groups present the largest risks?

people who inject drugs and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbmsm). i direct you to the government of canada publication, [\"estimates of hiv incidence, prevalence and canada’s progress on meeting the 90-90-90 hiv targets\"](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/summary-estimates-hiv-incidence-prevalence-canadas-progress-90-90-90.html) (data for 2018), and specifically to \"figure 9. proportion of new hiv infections by key population, canada, 2018 (n=2,242)\". 

**new infections** are distributed as follows:

* 49.5% (~1,109) in gbmsm
* 2.7% (~60) in gbmsm + pwid
* 13.0% (~312) in pwid
* 34.0% (~761) in heterosexuals 
* &lt;0.2% (~5) in other

[according to catie](https://www.catie.ca/sites/default/files/fs-epi-gbmsm-en-2018-09-07.pdf) (2018):

&gt; gbmsm represent approximately 2% to 3% of the adult male population in canada. based on this estimate there are approximately 345,284 to 517,926 adult gbmsm in canada. 

let's examine this from the mathematically conservative side of the equation. if we compare solely men (excluding drug users and approximating 50% of heterosexual persons infected), and set the relative risk according to the risk of a male who only engages in heterosexual activity vs someone who is in the gbmsm group, then we have:

    (1109/0.03)/(0.5*761/0.97)
    (312/0.007)/(0.5*761/0.97)

* 1 = the relative risk of a heterosexual, non-pwid male, as our reference.
* 94 = the relative risk of a gbmsm male.  
* 113 = the relative risk of a pwid (male or female)
  * note: [roughly 0.7% of canadians were pwid in 2016.](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/ajph.2019.305379) 

(note: the numbers for gbmsm and pwid would be slightly higher if the gbmsm+pwid group were included.)

note that we have two groups, both of which are approximately **100x** the relative risk. this isn't 2x or 3x the relative risk *of new infection*which would already be kind of high. this is *one hundred times more risky*. we cannot ignore that.

if we were to erase deferral on those who recently had a sexual encounter with someone in the gbmsm community, *we might as well end the ban on injection drug users*. 

## estimating the impact of donations from gbmsm with no deferral

i've previously [explained the math for how the window period affects risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/kcq1h0/uk_drops_abstinence_period_on_gay_men_donating/gft21ve/), but i'll repost here:

given the window period (but excluding human error &amp; testing errors) with current tech and no other filtering, the risk for hiv-1 would be *roughly* 0.005 %, or 1 in 20,000 donations in canada. here's how i come to that number using what i believe are conservative numbers:

* 600,000 msm men in canada
* 600 new hiv-1 diagnoses each year (in that population)
* that gives a 0.001 rate (0.1%)
* the window period of 16 days =&gt; 16/365 ~ 5% with rounding
* so one expects ~ 1 in 20,000 units donated from the msm group to have undetectable hiv
* if 4% of msm donate (the same rate as other canadians), that's 24,000 units
* 24000 / 20000 = 1.2 units every year, with a false-negative hiv assignment
* by comparison, the current rate (which includes all other factors) is estimated at 1 in 12.9 million
* 700,000 / 12.9 million = 0.054 units every year.

if we tested all of the tests individually, presuming perfect testing, and we bring the window period down to 9 days, that still means 0.675 units every year, which means that most years someone contracts hiv-1 from tainted blood.

1 person getting infected every 20 years is almost impossible to detect and tract. even if it's 1 person per year, it will be difficult. for countries which have eliminated their deferrals, an uptick in ttis hasn't been reported largely because it is very difficult to detect because there are often other plausible infection pathways. 

## double testing

hiv is not the only risk in the business. one is at greater risk of contracting hepatitis b or hepatitis c as a transfusion transmitted infection, both of which are more prevalent in the msm community, hence they are also part of the risk profile. 

for hepatitis b, the nucleic acid testing window period is up to 26.5 days. (cbs's 2016 report: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28389206/ )

however, if we stick with the 3 month deferral, then we get the *full* benefit of all of the tests that we are paying to do. because canadian blood services currently does *both* nat testing and antigen-based testing for all three of the major ttis. (see [cbs's clinical guide to transfusion](https://professionaleducation.blood.ca/en/transfusion/clinical-guide/donor-selection-donor-testing-and-pathogen-reduction)) so ask yourself: why is our healthcare system currently paying for every blood sample to be tested *twice* for the same set of viruses? because **testing errors** are always going to be an issue. 

having two tests means that in a large proportion of the samples tested, you have a form of **failsafe**. if one test fails, the other should catch it, so long as we maintain a sufficiently large (1 to 3 month) deferral window. 

## exchanging risk for validation

so what the anti-deferral lobby is asking is, \"won't you please just only do *only 0 or 1 test* on the blood of people who have had recent sexual encounters with msm?\" 

put this another way: the anti-deferral lobby are asking transfusion recipients (preemies, cancer patients, those undergoing surgery, hemophiliacs, etc...) **to bear the risk** so that they can receive *validation* through the medical system. 

i don't think that is reasonable. no one's and no group's validation should impinge upon the rights of others. 

and frankly, this could backfire. spectacularly. if, for example, someone's preemie baby gets hiv from a transfusion, that family will be entirely within their rights to demand answers. and the most likely answer will be that it came about because of the change in policy. this will result in real vilification of the msm population and widespread distrust in canada's blood supply. 

creating a safe and trustworthy blood supply is *why* canadian blood services and hema quebec were created. 

&gt; canadian blood services is committed to fulfilling the principles of the krever report, which puts safety first. [[source](https://www.blood.ca/en/about-us/nucleic-acid-amplification-testing-nat-hepatitis-c)]

ever read the krever report? i have. that's some heartbreaking stuff. we do not need to repeat that. a safe and adequate blood supply is more important than offering validation to a sexual minority.",liberals

i don't mean the expression of ideas, i mean adopting new words where there is no english equivalent. there is no hangup about the \"purity\" of the language, it constantly adopts foreign words.

some of them are obviously a little unwieldy, but there are plenty of cases where if the english equivalent is clunky we've adopted a french phrase. obviously there are french speakers who do the same with english or else this wouldn't have to be something moderated. the academie also came up with a phrase to replace the \"english\" word \"cookies (the tech kind)\" when cookies is actually a word english took from dutch. 

or see this article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_french_words_of_english_origin

this exchange between languages is only natural for ones in such close contact. 

&gt;so what should we québécois do? roll over, accept the english master language and assimilate?

not at all. i want more people speaking french. i just think it belies a fundamental misunderstanding of human cultural development. english is virtually unrecognizable from what it once was literally due to french invaders that established french as the language of the nobility. french was the main language of england for hundreds of years, the language of official documents for a few hundred years more. like i guess i could bemoan the loss of the language of beowulf, but in turn we gained the language of shakespeare, and now instead of the language of shakespeare we have the language of [insert favourite writer here].

french itself today is a far cry from what the norman's spoke, which itself was the culmination of several regional influences.

oh please. when people talk about new laws around abortion they're talking about restricting abortion rights. most of these aren't even terribly conservative. 

seriously you feel that banning coerced abortions is a social conservative issue? i'm pretty sure the left has commented that they didnt' like that when some first nations people brought it up recently :)  i'm not sure that's quite what people are talking about with regards to the 'abortion' issue. so you're pro pressuring native women into abortions? c'mon, if that doesn't cross the isle then there's something wrong with this country. 

funding pregnancy centers is not the same as anti abortion laws. 

and stopping the practice of paying for other people's abortions in other countries has nothing to do with abortion rights either at home or in the other countries. 

about the only one that's close is not allowing a practice of abortions based on the sex of the baby, and frankly i don't think that's terribly 'right wing' either. killing all female fetuses is a bit of an issue for a lot of people, i'm not sure the feminists on the liberal side are ok with it either. 

so really that whole site is just saying that she won\"t be doing anything to change abortion laws for women. i mean - it's pretty clear that's her point. she will not be bringing in new laws to limit people's access to abortion.. that is the opposite of promising to do something socially conservative.",conservatives

conservatism hasn't looked good through this past pandemic year on top of canadians seeing the clear morally corrupt evil nightmare of trump and us conservatism/hateful dangerous overt authoritarianism influencing things. cpc floor may have been 30% in the past, but that's not a universal law of how things must forever be.
