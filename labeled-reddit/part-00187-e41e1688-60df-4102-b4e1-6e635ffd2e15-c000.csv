hoi3mux,2021-12-13T20:15:26.000-08:00,"trudeau says he won't step into bill 21 debate to avoid triggering jurisdictional spat with quebec this bill sets a pre-defined level of what the state tolerates in terms of portrayal of religiosity for certain jobs. when people say \"yes but it just so happens that crosses can be easily hidden, but not hijabs\", yes that's true but that is simply because christians are not nearly as religious as muslims. 

most of you are trying to compare the \"common\" practices of each religion, which would entirely defeat the purpose of the bill. more secular muslim women can also wear a hidden muslim locket and that would be fine. the hijab, btw, is not even in the quran and is a symbol of being more religious than what is required by islam according to many scholars. 

i completely understand the confusion in this day of openness, tolerance and fight against system racism, but you can't apply the same principles with religion. religion is a choice that people make, unlike their race or sexual orientation. so if you are so religious that you can't even imagine removing your religious symbol to go to work, this tells me you are probably too extremist and hold values/beliefs that i don't want a public authority figure to have. 

i say this coming from a muslim family myself by the way, and my mom being a school teacher in quebec wearing the hijab. 

there are large numbers of muslim women in quebec in support of this bill. these women have fled from countries where these political symbols are common place, and they understand their significance better than anyone. ironically, people who lack such and understanding and who have never lived in muslim countries sympathize with the more fundamentalist/extremist women rather than the more secular ones.",liberals

it’s one of those things that’s difficult to raise as an issue without getting shouted down because it is theoretically intended to protect the environment, which is something that, in the abstract, sounds like the right thing to do. but if you ever have the misfortune of having to actually navigate it, it’s a disaster. 

somewhat relatedly, his reluctance to do anything that might alienate voters in the lower mainland and quebec created a very troubling precedent with tmx and the ability of a provincial government to completely overstep its constitutional bounds. among other things, it’s symptomatic of a political fracturing that he seems okay with overseeing so long as it looks like the end result may favour his party’s political prospects.

the plastics policy and corresponding amendments to cepa also create an issue that won’t have a significantly positive impact and will make it more difficult for the prairie provinces to diversify their economies.

the furor created by the lpc’s approach to taxing small business was completely unnecessary and, while it was ultimately abandoned, made it pretty clear their policy backroom is nowhere near as savvy as they think they are. 

the lpc’s housing policies have, in part, fuelled the rapid increase in housing costs. yes, it’s primarily a provincial and municipal issue, but giving and/or increasing loans and grants to first time or lower income homebuyers puts upward pressure on asking prices.

and frankly, his paternalistic approach to climate policy, whether you support his goals or not, is going to create a massive hole in the country’s finances. the political line is that it’s an “opportunity”; the reality is that it’s eventually going to result in the elimination of more than $100 billion in annual exports (significantly more than the auto industry in central canada) without any clear plan b. to be clear, it’s the lack of a plan b that is the problem here. there is no replacement for what we have, particularly for the prairie provinces, and his government has been incredibly dishonest about that.",liberals

(i'm not in the riding, so i was neutral.) there was an automated process for getting a ballot, where you would scan and submit your driver's license and a selfie, and the website would compare the two and check your name against the voter list. or you could connect to a zoom meeting and be assigned to a private breakout room, where a party staff person would check your id against the voter list and issue you a ballot.

the party doesn't keep any of the images from the driver's license and the selfie, it's just for authentication. i expect the privacy commissioner will need to determine whether the party and the vendor (jumio) can demonstrate that that they're not keeping the images. jumio says that it's fully compliant with the eu's gdpr privacy regulations. https://www.jumio.com/compliance-regulations/gdpr-compliance/

lastly i think the 3rd thing (first two being philosophy and economics) is history. many don’t trust or trust the government to be in charge of certain areas because of what governments have done in the past. government has committed horrific, scarring atrocities and has also created quality of life boosting programs. this ones way harder because it’s so general and i don’t know how to tell you to go about getting a good historical base without giving you a biased direction (i’m libertarian).

from here i’d start looking more into political ideologies. with your built base you can understand why these ideologies are rooted as so and then from there you can look at parties and see which ideologies they represent. once you get a handle on the different political ideologies that exist, you won’t even need you look up a party’s position on an issue anymore. you’ll be able to assume it because party’s usually follow a consistent philosophical base. as you learn, you’ll understand that most conservative, liberal, socialist etc party positions are very consistent with a more general applied world view/philosophy. best of luck man if i can help out any other way let me know",conservatives

just because somewhere else has the capacity to build something as complex as nuclear power plants fasts doesn't mean we can snap our fingers and scale up production. it takes time to build up that capacity and scale up. we should be investing in nuclear and working to expand it, but we need to be building clean energy now that is ready now, and that's where our investments need to be focused. building nuclear up in the oils sands is also insane. say you have something built by some miracle in 8 years, you would want to operate it for at least 30. global markets are still accepting canadian bitumen deposits on the global markets when there are cheaper alternatives (i. e. demand is similar to what it is today) we are pretty much finished on the climate change front, we've just given up and are allowing worst case scenarios to occur.",liberals

quebec has some 60% of kids in provincial child care, if provincial child care makes up 50% of all child care, then that means that a further 30% are in private child care... most likely 75% of that wait list is also in private child care, so there are really about 12,000 kids that don't have child care... that's about 1% of the kids in quebec

again. when you actually look at the numbers, it's not bad... there are roughly 1.1 million kids in [quebec under 12](https://childcarecanada.org/sites/default/files/pq.pdf)

again, you're only looking at the waiting list for subsidised child care... you're not looking at how many are actually in child care. with nearly 500,000 kids in subsidised child care (again, numbers the rest of the country would kill for), quebec is not a recipe for disaster, quebec has a system that, while not perfect, is working better, by a very long shot, than any other system in canada.",liberals

1. spending during the pandemic was massive and done by every western democracy regardless of political leaning. trump did it, boris johnson did it. it is the recommended approach for government to manage world-wide economic crisis, and falls into founding principal of canada's constitution act 1867 - \"peace, order and good government\" .
2. the people we honour with statues reflect our society's values. this movement to remove statues of those who did great harm to large groups of canadians is still new and the public debate on this is still ongoing. a society that mythologizes its past is in danger of stagnation of its political discourse, though i'll admit stagnation of political change is a conservative value.
3. natural resources are a public good and the source of almost all of canada's wealth. it would be foolish to squander this wealth in the present to end up unable to support the citizens in the future. canada has not done well on this front, especially with our oil wealth - look how alberta now struggles while norway has the largest sovereign fund in the world.
4. regulating speech falls into the \"peace, order and good government\" which is the founding principal of our country. allowing unfettered hate speech is not aligned with peace and order. the internet now necessitates additional measures to ensure we continue to meet these goals in an online world.
5. yep, trudeau is obviously partial to cronyism, which is bad but no atypical for pms. there have been two major crisis during his time as pm - trump's attacks on our trade and the coronavirus. with trade he managed to make canada come out with a better deal than we had in nafta (though i'd put that on chrystia freeland) and our coronavirus vaccine procurement has been excellent despite having no native product, and the financial supports were rolled out with a speed that was staggering and helped many avoid poverty. it's impossible of course to say if the cpc would have done any better or worse if they were in power, though conservative provincial governments have most definitely done worse than other provinces.

hecuwns,2021-09-26T01:34:37.000-07:00,"erin o'toole promised to remake the conservative party. so why are his mps so white and male? i think we are very close to agreement here. firstly, you are right that there are underlying reasons that need to be explored as to why these gaps in representation exist. but that's kind of the point of pointing this out, so we can ask ourselves what has led to certain groups being left out. in this case it is largely because they only won in rural majority white ridings. now we should also be asking whether it's a coincidence that they only appeal to the ridings that are majority white, did they put more resources into supporting white candidates etc.? and by asking these questions i am not assuming the conclusion to be that they are racist. my hypothesis personally is just that the cpc appeals to rural voters who happen to be white and it is a coincidence that they mostly elected white men. however, that does not even begin to tell us why they elected so few women. 

&gt;it may come back to the number of students, the number of applicants, and so forth. i haven't heard of an issue where black or south asian doctors are out of work whereas hospitals are banging at the doors of their white counterparts to hire them.

once poc become doctors there isn't an issue the problem happens during the recruitment process, although it has largely improved over the last decade or so, which is why we are seeing so much improvement in healthcare for poc. in canada anyway. 

&gt;\"why are there so many white males?\", why not simply ask \"how do we get more [under represented group] to pursue politics?\"

these are different questions that are both frequently asked, but have to be asked at the appropriate time. the first question establishes whether there is over or under representation of one group or another. the second considers how we correct for the discrepancy. again in this case of cpc mps it is not a case of not enough poc involved in politics it is a case of the cpc only appealing to rural voters. 

last point, and honestly i mean no offense, but you just have to be less sensitive about these things. no one is blaming white guys for getting elected, people are just wondering if the circumstances that led to only white guys being elected were discriminatory and need to be corrected. you may notice that no one is upset about any individual white man doing any particular job as long as he is (or at least is viewed as) competent. the problem we have is when mediocre white men (or anyone else for that matter) are given opportunity to over more capable people due to implicit bias in a system. as long as you aren't incompetent you have nothing to fear in equality.",conservatives

the experts weren't wrong, there was no new science, masks work and we knew they worked at the time. some public health officials were wrong. journalists are supposed to cover the story including consulting experts and misleading on stories because that was the government position at the time.

you are the one who was moaning how the vaccine passport is a conspiracy to hinder your freedom of travel. and now you move the goalpost and moan about the industry. ok, let's talk about the industry then.

do you know why people are still not flying at pre-pandemic level? because they don't feel safe. they don't know whoever sitting next to them is vaccinated or not, or maybe even contagious. airlines are actually happy to have this mandate, because it can give passengers confidence. read the following:

the mandate is going to increase the demand the travel, not the other way around. also if the demand gets lower, the ticket price goes down not up, it's basic economics.

lastly, i work for an airline. i am very concerned about my co-workers who work front line at airports and in flight. they come across a large amount of people everyday, and every time i see news about unruly passengers who refuse to wear a mask or even throw a fit, i get worry. having the vaccine mandate protects them, it's win-win-win for travellers, staff and airline companies.
