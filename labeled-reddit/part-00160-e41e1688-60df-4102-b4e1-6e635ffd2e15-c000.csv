&gt;if he's elected jan. 23, harper said, territorial battalions made up of 100 regular troops and 400 or more reservists would be stationed in vancouver, calgary, regina, winnipeg, the toronto area and other major metropolitan areas.

&gt;**harper also announced he would:**

* &gt;increase pacific navy personnel levels by about 500.

* &gt;purchase a new replenishment ship and new transport ship and upgrade existing frigates and submarines.

* &gt;restore a regular army presence in british columbia with a new rapid reaction army battalion of 650 regular force personnel.

second, the choice isn't just between daycare and having a stay-at-home parent.  some people have grandparents or aunts/uncles providing childcare; some people have informal arrangements with neighbours; some parents arrange their work hours (often with one or both working part time) to avoid having both parents working at once.

finally, if we consider families as an economic unit -- the way we do for all sorts of subsidies, although oddly enough not for income taxes -- having a stay-at-home parent and a working-outside-the-home parent may be the outcome which yields the highest economic productivity.  if me staying home allows my wife to earn more money, i'm making an indirect economic contribution even if i'm not making a direct financial one.",conservatives

you literally repeat right wing fb memes, with ridiculous hyperbolic statements about canada ending up like greece.

here’s a tip for your, learn a little about economics before screaming about “liberal bankruptcy and greece”.

1) in your originally comment you don’t know the difference between debt and deficits, as you used the word incorrectly.

2) canada has one of the lowest debt to gdp ratios of any nation in the g7 (pre covid under trudeau it was the lowest), so before canada becomes greece, you’d have to see a collapse of the us, france, uk, germany, italy and japan. i couldn’t imagine living my daily life believing hyperbolic statements like “canada is just about to become greece…” lmfao… it’s so sad you are that uninformed.

as for the 2 michael’s, it was your trump god, in the us that pressured canada to detain meng, instead the us should have done the dirty work themselves instead of having canada take the brunt of the work. she was flying over us airspace to mexico… but they didn’t have the balls to do it themselves. we did the us’s dirty work for them, so they should help to get them out. have you ever thought that maybe the 5g decision won’t be made until after meng gets released or extradited to the us, or would that strategizing be too complicated for you to think of…

to clarify, i actually agree with you that the greens have made remarkable use of media attention with what they have. it's not easy to get noticed as a caucus of 3 in a majority pc situation, especially as covid is hogging all the space. 

i don't know if non-politicized people who don't read/listen to the news are aware of anything but the government's handling of covid though, and that was my point.

jeff and betty are told to go out and do a survey, and in a pure, platonic ideal world, they go out and take a random sampling of 1000 people each. 95% of the time, both jeff's mean and betty's mean should be within the margin of errors of one another, and 99.67% of time, jeff's result should be within three standard deviations of betty's mean, and vice versa. we would also expect that even though jeff and betty's results could have a vast difference between them, they're more likely than not to be fairly close to one another (ie within one standard deviation of each other's means). and 1 out of 20 times they do this (probabilistically), jeff and betty are going to have a much bigger gap and get a result outside of the margin of error. that's not only okay, that's expected. but it starts to become improbable if you ask jeff and betty to do the same thing again, sample 1000 people each, and they're still outside of one another's margins of error. 

outliers are by their nature not impossible results, but they are *improbable,* so having outliers appear over and over again indicates something weird is going on. 

of course, we don't live in an ideal, platonic world, so the obvious difference comes down to methodology. the goal of jeff or betty is to try and get at the 'true' result for whatever their survey is-- that's the whole point of doing public opinion polling at all--so the methodology being used, even if it differs, should be designed to impact the result as little as possible. the sample pulled from the population should be as broad and random as possible, and so forth. two companies with two different methodologies, unless there's something wrong with the method, should be getting very similar results. 

so, if jeff and betty are getting dramatically different results, it likely comes down to methodology, which is my whole point. someone's methodology is screwed up. someone's sampling isn't truly as random as it should be. someone is processing the numbers in a wrong way. 

in other words; when someone suggests a poll is an outlier, they probably don't mean it's an outlier in the statistical sense (that is, a poll that has a 1/20 chance of happening) but a methodological sense (that is, these results seems suspect and someone somewhere has screwed up the process of doing the survey for this result to occur).",liberals

i’m not sure why, at the end of 2021, this point still needs to be made, but i guess it does. people are literally dying in suffocating agony because of facebook posts spreading lies about a life-saving vaccine. but, yeah, disinformation isn’t real or something. of course, you [don’t have to ask the prime minister](https://www.tvo.org/video/ron-deibert-fix-social-media-save-democracy):

&gt;one specific thing i talk about in the book is the way in which social media and the entire communications ecosystem helps propel forward authoritarianism. and it really happens in two ways: one is around what we just talked about. this environment on the content lair, if you will, the fact that you have content that's pushed forward at a rapid pace, that's emotional and extreme and so on. it makes it difficult for people to fact-check, to stop, slow down, and really examine claims. but it also turns out to be the perfect environment for those who wish to sow chaos and division and undermine society. a lot of that is with respect to russia, its disinformation campaigns. russia is not alone. there are many governments out there that are beginning to see social media as a kind of giant disinformation laboratory, and the aim here is not really to push a particular ideology. it's not to push an agenda. it's simply to confuse, distract, disorient, and ultimately kind of bring about a political paralysis through fatigue. so you start questioning, you know, what's real or not, what's the truth or not, can i believe anything? that serves their end. the other way in which it really helps authoritarian practices is by the inherent insecurity. so, as i said, the aim of these technology platforms is to push more and more sensors out, more and more applications, constantly to get closer and closer to us. so, you have this ecosystem that is invasive by design but highly insecure.

[similar points have been made by yale historian of 20th century europe and authoritarianism, timothy snyder.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/05/21/fascism-is-back-blame-the-internet/) [freedom house agrees.](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2019/crisis-social-media) and there’s [this](https://twitter.com/davetroy/status/1452290807491440648):

&gt;disinformation is the operational end of a process designed to break down society and radicalize it into cultish forms. this process leads people away from truth.  
&gt;  
&gt;we can’t address this process by distributing truth; the cure for disinfo is not simply truth.  
&gt;  
&gt;…  
&gt;  
&gt;we don’t look enough at the relationship between identity, in-group, and belief. they are all reflections of the same thing and you can’t alter one without altering the others. this is why injecting garbage breaks down social ties and alters belief and identity.  
&gt;  
&gt;sufficiently radicalized, people won’t recover their prior social connections, leaving them stranded on “islands of dissensus.” there is no natural pathway back from this. it’s a one way process. throwing truth at them doesn’t restore lost social/family ties; it alienates them.

many of the denialist and conspiratorial comments posted here thus far simply prove these points. but it would make sense, in a twisted sort of way. we’re on social media, so of course those things would show up on a post about disinformation and conspiracy. gotta keep feeding the beast, i guess.",liberals

like, surely there's no way every single municipality in canada has been making the exact same decisions, causing the exact same problems. there's gotta be something overarching that's impacting the entire country, which would be at federal levels.

i suppose it could just be interest rates, which are absolutely a colossal factor, but... i dunno. surely there's gotta be something more to it that has at least put us in this situation, even if it's something that can't be reasonably undone at this point.",liberals

part of it might be ego, but part of it is also personal frustration with a party that i used to admire and in fact voted for in the past. sure, soundbites are a fact a life in elections, but i really doubted the ndp's sincerity this time. i also want a better future, but that future involves an affordable childcare program, so that i can maybe afford kids down the road, and concrete action on climate change. i could see getting both of these with a liberal government, but not a conservative one, and i was disappointed to see singh come out and attack trudeau relentlessly when those things were at stake. i think we can engage young people on these things too, but in a way that is rational and amounts to more than just slogans and, in my opinion, superfluous demonstrations. it would be different if what you were engaging with kids on was an actual discussion  maybe, rather than just \"hey, we should tax the rich, watch me dance!\"

edit: although, that isn't always engaging for kids anyway and sometimes you're left to trying to meet them where their interests are. i still don't think it works if you just play a game with them and then slap on \"tax the rich\" at the end though. i think kids are interested in the issues themselves. sometimes, when i'm planning lessons, i use a social justice lens because that is, in fact, what engages kids, and it is worth talking about, but talking about it is key in my opinion.",liberals

it’s a well researched topic and there’s a lot of entry level literature surrounding exactly what you are talking about.

that’s a big reason why you see so many immigrants in low skilled jobs, they are going to school again here usually to re learn something and gain proper credentials.

to all the panicked libbies and conservatives...the rona is a sars virus, as is something we call \"the common cold\". anyone who still thinks we will ever eradicate the rona is a plank...plain and simple.

these \"variants\" may be more contagious, but they're also less lethal. the rona will continue to mutate to the point where it will be a minor nuisance like...the common cold...or the flu.

in fact, the death rate of the rona is very similar to that of the flu. dangerous for the elderly and physically challenged...a week in bed for the rest. and now that treatments are finally being accepted, the death rate will naturally plunge.

the rona is here to stay. we will learn to deal with that. but we also now know that the rona is a man-made virus that fauci funded. will we hold him, all the other lying \"scientists\" and china responsible?
