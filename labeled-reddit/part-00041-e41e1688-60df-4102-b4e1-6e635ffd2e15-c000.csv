gq0w2dj,2021-03-06T05:54:38.000-08:00,"when will the liberal government keep its promises on national pharmacare? &gt;it would appear that our elected mps are out of step with the opinion of canadians when it comes to universal prescription drug coverage. a recent study found nearly nine-in-ten canadians supported the idea, including three quarters of conservative supporters. furthermore, 77 per cent stated that this should be a high-priority issue for the federal government.

&gt;pharmacare not only makes sense from a health care perspective — it also makes financial sense. currently, we rely on a convoluted patchwork of more than 100 public prescription drug plans and 100,000 private plans that is one of the most expensive in the world. universal public drug coverage would reduce total expenditure on prescription drugs in canada by between $4.2 to 9.4 billion and save the private sector between $6.6 to 9.6 billion. these findings were replicated in the study conducted by the parliamentary budget officer in 2018.

seems the majority of canadians do consider it relevant and it would actually be cost effective.

regardless, the point is that the liberals have promised it, yet are failing to deliver it and even in some cases (re: the ndp bill) are actively hindering its progress. if they didn't plan to implement it and don't believe in it, they should be honest about that to canadians. certainly you can agree with that at least?

the system is going to need to be fully costed with a new tax system in order to pay for it. is it going to be a tax on citizens, paid out of their income taxes? or is it going to be a tax on wages paid out by employers? how do we make a new tax appealing and non controversial?

any talk of \"elites\" or even \"liberal\" as a catch all phrase is meant to channel these fears (some of which may be justified). brexit was supported for similar reasons, it was less about individual policy implications of leaving the eu, but rather a general sense that power was being stripped from the country by globalization. this fear goes across typical demographics, and from a political point of view can be very useful to bridge tricky policy gaps that people might have with the conservative platform.",conservatives

what is saddest in all of this is both trudeau and sheer had good approaches in 2019, but their plans together would have made it that much more effective. 

sheers plan was innovate in the sense that encouraged investment in greener technologies, however it lacked in the enforcement and target areas. he makes a great point if canada stopped producing carbon tomorrow it has very little effect on the world. instead, if we have the greenest manufacturing industry in the world, that’s a far greater contribution and an asset for the world to buy canadian. 

trudeaus plan is good in the sense that there is definitive actions to meet clearly defined targets, however is a tax / expense and the proceeds go back to low income earners. businesses can’t afford to reinvest in their company because you took a portion of their profit making them less competitive. it doesn’t allow for industry to invest and solve the emission issues for the gov’t. 

so the answer is trudeaus plan for carbon pricing, targets and enforcement. sheers plan to allow businesses to plan and reinvest in making their businesses greener (with results) for a period of time, providing incentives to offset the tax.  the proceeds from the carbon tax get reinvested into the program…  and you have a plan that drives itself!

you are correct, and that is in fact how most undocumented foreigners end up staying in canada, living \"under the radar\" so to speak. however, what has gone on at roxham road (among other places along the border) is somewhat different where many, if not most could not qualify for a visitor's visa in any event (i.e. they were living undocumented in the u.s., or transited the u.s. on visitor's visas, or could not ever establish that they had an intention to return home after their \"vacation\", and thus would therefore not qualify for legal entry to canada). for many, rr/claiming asylum was \"sold\" on the internet/social media as a \"back door\" to canada, with promises of high chances of success because of canada's perceived \"soft touch\" on asylees. the levels of ridiculousness were so high (and the stories so fantastic) that the feds had to put out ads and send representatives to foreign places, just to try to correct the misinformation.",conservatives

hcz7l59,2021-09-15T04:00:37.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - wednesday, september 15, 2021 well new brunswick is in breach of the canada health act by saying they would only pay for abortions in hospitals and that they will allow hospitals to decide whether to provide them or not (tentatively based on need). under the act they are expected to pay any billing for the service because in canada abortion is considered a \"medically necessary procedure\" under the law. and as a medically necessary procedure there is no way to pay for it privately as an individual. 

this has resulted in fredericton having no abortion clinic, as it was a private practice that billed the public system (this is how healthcare works in canada for most things). and only two cities in the entire province offer the procedure now. 

so its not banned but it is restricted by way of a policy decision. 

o'toole's answer, in practical terms, doesn't really help shed light on what he would do. right now the lpc as sitting government has applied a slow boil method over the summer where they are withholding some funds from the health transfer that nb is going to get next time it goes out and the longer they don't fix it the bigger this health transfer deficit is going to get. 

he did say \"access\" is a federal issue, but nb claims they are still providing access because abortions can be done at one of three hospitals in two cities. 

the current government argues that by not paying the bills sent by a private practice for publicly paid for procedures (which again, is how most doctors offices are run, they bill the province for what you went in for) they are effectively restricting access. in practice this failure to pay caused the clinic to close down in the third city that had the procedure in the province. 

so, is that restricted access? would otoole step in or would he consider this in the province's prerogative? i don't know. 

now, i don't think the issue is going to be huge in the media, but let's not pretend that it was a bad answer given the fact that there is an active case of it happening right now.",conservatives

actually, the present legal framework (including the stca) does in fact recognize international law. international law requires that states accept/process claims for asylum at its borders (hence the mess at roxham road), and international law also requires that prospective asylees make their claims in the first available country of refuge that they arrive in (hence the stca). those who advocate for an end to the stca merely wish to ignore the \"second half\" of the international law regarding asylees.",conservatives

i don't believe this is illegal in canada. i'm not an immigration lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt, but from what i understand, crossing somewhere other than an official port of entry is only illegal if you do not report to an immigration officer immediately. 

the immigration [regulations](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-9.html#h-686042) specifically mention this:

*\"27 (2) unless these regulations provide otherwise, a person who seeks to enter canada at a place other than a port of entry must appear without delay for examination at the port of entry that is nearest to that place.\"*

obviously, places like roxham road have a heavy law enforcement presence, so any potential asylum speaker would almost certainly appear before an immigration officer 'without delay' - that's the whole point of doing this.

i think it's fair to call it a loophole, although it is ultimately a loophole to the safe third country agreement, which is somewhat questionable in its own right (as the article points out).

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;and back to the root of o'tooles argument, is it not jumping the queue of other refugee claimants who follow the official process?

i don't really understand his point about queue jumping. refugee cases are heard on a first come first served basis - coming in this way doesn't give anyone special priority, as far as i know.

i think there are certainly issues with people doing it this way, and it's not a sustainable or desirable solution. but in my mind, the blame lies with the safe third country agreement and the convoluted legal framework we have, not the asylum seekers themselves.",conservatives

those abuses do have a corrosive effect on canadians' confidence in our immigration system, but the actual levels of abuse aren't anything close to what a lot of other g7 countries are facing right now. the aggravating thing for many of us is that the abuses would not be hard to address through proactive policy measures, but the feds just won't do so.",conservatives

it may not have been used often in this context - but that's partly because this context is comparatively rare.

&gt;critics of the liberals wouldn't be so vocal if this same government hadn't tried multiple different ways to stonewall and block documents going to committees.

the liberals stonewalled because they (rightfully) recognized that this format of disclosure, especially with no notice or approval of our allies that gave us the intelligence, is likely to cause massive harm in the natsec area.

first, the house does need to exclude it if it doesn't want s. 38 to apply. section 38 is legislation enacted by parliament. it's not optional to comply or not. a future legislature can ignore that law, but if they want to do so they damn well better specifically say that the law does not apply. it's like where an expropriation occurs - the default is that compensation will be paid (or in this case, s. 38 will be complied with) unless stated otherwise expressly.

* the incidents of blood clots from az is about [1 in 250000](https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/04/17/understanding-the-blood-clot-issue-behind-the-astrazeneca-vaccine-and-its-safety.html) or so.
* however, if you get covid, the risk of getting blood clots in [10 times higher](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/blood-clot-risk-from-covid-19-higher-than-after-vaccines-study-68675) than the az vaccine.

i would also recommend taking a look at the epidemiology data that the feds put out every day at the [site here](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html). this page provides details on the number of covid cases per age cohort, and how many people have been hospitalized, been put into the icu or have died from covid. many people focus on the deaths caused by covid, but overlook the hospitalization/icu numbers, because i believe that you're sick enough to be put into the hospital with covid, you're likely to be experiencing negative health impacts (not limited to blood clots) for some time afterwards. i cobbled together the following data from the page to determine hospitalization odds and odds of being in the icu, if hospitalized, and have come up with the following:

&amp;#x200b;

|*age cohort*|*covid case #'s*|*admitted to hospital*|*odds of being hospitalized*|*admitted to icu*|*odds of being in icu (if hospitalized)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0-19|195499|902|1 in 200|131|15 in 100|
|20-29|206098|1914|1 in 100|265|14 in 100|
|30-39|175958|4351|2.5 in 100|908|21 in 100|
|40-49|160097|3161|2 in 100|504|16 in 100|
|50-59|145403|7308|5 in 100|1840|25 in 100|
|60-69|91372|9696|11 in 100|2636|27 in 100|
|70-79|50671|11793|23 in 100|2569|22 in 100|
|80+|65709|17469|27 in 100|1291|7 in 100|

even if you're in the youngest cohort, and you get covid, you have a 1 in 200 chance of being hospitalized from it. and, if you're hospitalized from it, you have a 15 in 100 chance of needing to visit the icu. those are much, much better odds than the 1 in 250000 chance that you would get blood clots from covid.

i'm 40+ and just put myself on a waiting list for az. i'll take whatever vaccine they give me, because i think the odds of something negative happening from any of the vaccines is much, much lower than anything that is in the chart above.

edit: i think the icu odds are lower for the 80+ cohort because may be because they are dying after being hospitalized, but weren't put in an icu unit. just conjecture, but one of my wife's aunts was 80+ and died in hospital - she was put into palliative care instead of going to the icu.",liberals

polling at this point is largely focused on the party rather than the leader (except of course the premier). that’s why you aren’t really seeing people being turned off. i’d be interested in seeing pollsters ask liberal voters on who is the current leader of the olp. i bet more than half couldn’t name del duca.

boring is one thing, but del duce has a mountain of baggage. it could sink him depending on how the campaign goes or if it’s more focused on ford’s failings then it might not affect him much. i’m not saying this as someone who generally is an ndp or green supporter, literally anyone else in the olp leadership contest would’ve been more appealing and less vulnerable.

as for the ndp, i don’t get the hate that horwath gets. she has maintained or improved the party’s standings in every election she has ran in. her personal approval ratings are generally the best of all leaders. it’s just the ndp branding that sucks in ontario after rae. i don’t think any leader could do better. their fundraising numbers haven’t been better. they had a huge candidate issue in the last election with many controversial candidates that got through vetting and that they were largely scraping at the bottom of the barrel since no one expected them to be in contention to actually win. that shouldn’t be the case in the next election as they have a shot and will be able to recruit better candidates.

i’m not saying the greens have a shot at winning the next election - that’s just not going to happen. but they could definitely pick up one or two seats. and the stronger green seats are currently held by the pcs so they could snag a few of those and have a better chance at keeping the pcs to a minority.",liberals

\\&gt; the economy is going to easily absorb this spending. 

it's not about the economy absorbing anything. it's about the debt load. this kind of thing always leads to higher interest rates, reduced economy and inevitably higher inflation. in the 80's we saw the policy of heavy gov't intervention and borrowing from the 70's force interest rates up into the 20 percent range. just to put that in perspective, if our debt cycled through that rate we'd be paying  200 billion dollars in interest payments alone. which is about 2/3 of our entire budget (prior to 2020) 

obviously we'd be bankrupt long before that. it is honestly difficult to imagine we could sustain 10 percent for very long. even 5 , a traditional 'low' for us, will mean very difficult financial times. 

and of course those rising interest rates wind up crashing the housing market. prices collapse so nobody can sell, but the costs stay the same as when the prices were high due to interest rates. so the kids still can't buy, the older ones can't sell,  nobody will build, and there's a strong economic downturn.",liberals

check out [https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html)

slightly more than half the vaccine has been administered which is exactly what you'd expect as only recently have people been getting their second dose.

if the argument is that its slow, its because the supply from the feds is slow.

health canada went through a process to approve these two vaccines.  going over the research health canada knows there is no evidence to support only giving one dose as effective.  health canada should be stepping into say what some provinces are doing is irresponsible - that they didn't approve the vaccine so that provinces could ignore the instructions from the manufacture.   canadians in any province should not be experimented on but it appears some provinces are doing just that.

and frankly, we shouldn't trust the supply.  it could collapse.  there could be delays.  the country of origin could suddenly not allow it to leave before their citizens are treated first, etc....allot could go wrong that is out of the hands of anyone in canada.  something as simple as a delivery to canada spoiling can happen if in transit the freezers fail.

&gt;foucauldian post-structuralists are interested in binaries that either are or can be understood to be hierarchical. the key liberatory project is to discern how these are ordinarily arrayed and then to reverse them.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;it is one of the great ironies of this kind of work that it supposes itself to be radically transgressive on the subject of epistemology and yet is rigidly formulaic in application. it will identify two terms, one privileged, the other not; the analysis “violates” the boundaries of this order by turning it upside down. it can be good fun, but part of the fun is the safety of it: it preserves the overall order very perfectly, which is why it is so attractive to elites.  
&gt;  
&gt;consider present day calls to remake the academy. there should be more soft sociology of the hard sciences; there should be more women in male dominated disciplines; we should “indigenize” the university. there are two terms in each case; we should reverse the conventional hierarchy of those terms; and the results will be profoundly liberatory, because, ptolemaically, the university rather than the world is the most important locus of struggle

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the pervasiveness of this formula helps to explain the widespread enthusiasm for gender identity ideology in the academy. the relevant flippages are of at least three kinds. first is the reversal of the sex:gender relation as it is commonly understood. ordinarily sex has primacy. it is the biological given upon which the cultural constructions of gender are elaborated. in gender identity ideology, the terms are reversed. gender is essential, and sex is the unsteady social construct.  
&gt;  
&gt;to be, in any way, a traditional scholar under such circumstances is to be a problem. radical feminists are “traditionalists” in this sense, in that they root their analysis in the materiality of biological sex and take the oppression of women to be linked to the control of reproduction. in the present scholarly ecumene, this aligns them in some respects with scholars who are traditional and conservative, and explains why they, like conservatives, are so often in trouble with their institutions under present conditions.

radical feminists are the new conservatives. a radical feminist says it herself. funny how times change. this article is important as it shows how conservatives can do better with women. traditionally women that voted conservative did not call themselves feminist. but now the world has gone so far left that certain feminists start viewing themselves as conservative. pushing back against anti-science rhetoric of mainstream left on the topic of what it means to be a woman, can increase the party's  success with women.",conservatives

with regard to whether o’toole has functional control of the party per say, ultimately he is the leader and he is the direction that the party members have chosen to move forward. above all else politicians care about electability and being re-elected. if they are shown through this election that this strategy gets cpc members elected then there won’t be issues about the vast majority towing the line. actions made by mps prior to this election and prior to when the platform was presented aren’t representative of where the party is now and mps vote where their base tells them to move to. 

frankly i hope the conservatives get elected in this cycle in part for that reason, because it would serve as a significant catalyst that pushes the conservative party back towards the center to provide a rational second option to canada’s ever further left political spectrum. otherwise i fear that the conclusion will be that moving to the middle didn’t work so instead the conservative party will slide back to the right, leading to further political division in our country as we have seen throughout much of the rest of the world.",conservatives

i wonder whether the common canadian habit of \"vote splitting\" at the federal and provincial levels might be a nice safeguard. (look at how there are a lot of conservative premiers with a liberal pm right now, but in 2006 it was mostly liberal/ndp premiers with a conservative pm).

there's less incentive to sulk over an election loss if you can get into power at a different level of government. (e.g. jason kenney)

whereas in the us, states tend to be \"red\" or \"blue\" and there won't a democrat government in south carolina anytime soon, or vice versa with the republicans in oregon. and for states like georgia that are at a tipping point, the republicans are hella desperate to cling to power because they're afraid that once they start losing, they'll never have another chance at power.",liberals

personally it feels riskier to give money to a group to help build something while expecting a return on their investments. it's like charging ourselves extra to the benefit of the cib and its funders. it was a vehicle for private interests to get their hands on public assets and revenue streams. 

so yes, we pay and transfer the risk, and the risk has some value, but these p3 deals are ripoffs promoted by large financial interests. the canadian central bank already has a mandate to offer low interest loans to provinces and municipalities for less than 2%. the cib with their use of p3s was expecting returns of up to 7-9%, there was info here but the link is now broken https://psacunion.ca/user/login?destination=node/6022

we also do not need larry fink, the ceo of blackrock the largest financial firm in the world consulting on these type of activities, along with other large us banks that have demonstrated time and time again contempt for the majority of people and the long term stability of the system, orchestrating major financial crashes and asset manipulation through their unchecked greed.
https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2020/07/02/how-ottawa-is-driving-up-the-cost-of-infrastructure-by-listening-to-wall-street.html

the goal of blackrock is not to improve public infrastructure, it is to maximize their profits and their power. the company has an absolutely despicable track record and is one of the largest advocates for private ownership of public infrastructure.

yes, that's an important point to keep in mind, they do revert back to the public eventually. however, i feel like what this essentially means is that the public gets a piece of infrastructure back just in time for its major rehabilitation schedule to get started. and who knows, perhaps the contractor actually did do solid upkeep and repairs for their contract. or maybe they sub-contracted the expense out and have been keeping up with the bare minimum required in the specs. [infrastructure asset management is the niche i'm trying to squeeze into]

and yeah, it's fair to say that any number of p3 projects have been hobbled from the outset by conservative (and liberal. just as many examples here.) governments either being corrupt or deeply stupid w/r/t their procurement process.

hypocrisy, in my view, is when you insist on a standard for someone else that you do not follow yourself. 

so let's have a look at the facts:

singh says that an election before we have the pandemic more under control would be a bad thing, and would be a power grab. let's say for the sake of argument that he's right on both counts.

singh also campaigned for john horgan, who called an election during a pandemic as a naked power grab.

the problem, i think, for the hypocrisy view, is that you could believe strongly that john horgan is an asshole who should not have called an election, and still think it is important for him to get reelected. mr. singh would be a hypocrite if he himself called an election in such circumstances, but once one is called, you have to make the best of it. i just don't think there's a logical inconsistency there.

three out of four of them involved someone upset they didn't get what they wanted and responded violently.  four out of four of them likely required police intervention, at least two out of four of them sound like mental illness is involved.

hc6mqo8,2021-09-09T00:18:26.000-07:00,"discussion thread - élection 2021: le débat de chefs i'll not speak about lévesque, as this part of history is a bad place to go to speak about my culture.

est québécois qui veut l'être is something that is far larger than both those personalities, as it designates the idea behind the very concept of the national identity of being québécois, as opposite of the traditional ethnic naming behind canadien/canadien français. 

trudeau is infamous for fighting tooth and nail against the cultural specificity of the québécois culture, and so québécois for him is about being historically tied to the province, the political entity, etc. for pet and those who think like him, you're québécois if you live here, and you're not if you leave.

the modern identity of being québécois is about culture though. it was invented to go further than our traditional ethnic group. one cannot become canadien français, but one can become québécois for sure. my syrian neighbours identified as québécois the moment they began learning about the culture and the language, and i considered them completely québécois, even though they were not canadian, as they didn't have any status here for the time being. in another life, my soccer teammate from toronto was an ontarian living in québec, in his eyes and mine, until he learned the language and decided he was québécois. and he was automatically one for me and my friends too. same thing for a huge deal of people.

and so, it's typical québec situation: you're québécois in a fiscal sense if you pay your dues and you're québécois if you can vote here. that's the older way of thinking, the one that existed before québécois meant anything to the people here other than a descriptor. but you can become québécois, as in put on the cultural mantle, the moment you embrace the culture as your own. there are no official way of doing so, mind you. the common denominator is often the acknowledgement of a distinct culture that exist here, the appreciation of the cultural quirks that make us sometimes strangers in a known land, the love of a common language that makes it possible to exist as a nation, even though we're a cultural minority, etc. as they are no answers, it's just an open concept, which is why it's important for me that the est québécois qui veut l'être concept stays like it. 

anyone that wants it can become québécois. and nobody can stop you from doing so.",liberals

hc6p38i,2021-09-09T00:35:43.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - thursday, september 9, 2021 the ppc could have invigorated a subsection of the population who have only just started getting into politics. a new tap of voters.

also, it is possible. i mean, the cpc has a strong base out west. the ndp have a tiny base, and there are a lot of ndp/lpc fluid voters - not the case with the cpc previously.

the ppc is also tapping into angry people. across party lines. i mean, the ppc numbers go up a bit lately, the cpc has been steady and the other parties have been bleeding numbers to the ppc. the cpc's initial drop went to ppc, and now there's a small trickle from everyone else.

the ppc's strongest voter base is the under 35s, and the next group also has a lot of ppc voters - just like the ndp. so surprisingly, it looks like young conservatives are more libertarian than socon, and cpc is losing the thread on small government.

plus there's a general disaffection among millenials and it looks like for people 40ish and under, the new ideological spectrum is sitting on the ndp and ppc sides. maybe not entirely, but the established cpc and lpc are being turned on by them because they feel underserved in a large enough proportion that you get a strong youth lean on the ndp's approach as a counter to the centre left lpc and the ppc as a counter to the mode centre right cpc (this election anyway). the divisions that everyone likes to pretend are extremes being built in older folks on facebook aren't quite as devisive in practice when you look at political leanings.

it is also possible that these are protest votes, people mad in general and wanting to inflict maximum frustration on existing parties and the ppc is the best way to do it. unlikely to actually gain power, unlikely to win many seats, but definitely on the radar enough to make people think about what's happening when they see a big national percent vote. i mean the 11% is big but if its spread so thinly it won't matter in our system. either this is being taken advantage of instead of a ballot being spoiled, or people are using it to show that the electoral system is broken and they don't care etc.

all in all i think the ppc is collecting disaffected voters. both the \"i believe in these policies against vaccines and mandates and freedom curtailments\" sense of disaffection, and in the \"i want to make a point because life fucking sucks\" sense of disaffection.

this isn't to say there aren't people who truly believe in the ppc platform and everything in it - there are - but i don't think we have 11% ardent platform supporters of the ppc out there. let's be real. they're positions are kind of out there when it comes to all of canada views. 

i also don't think its actually 11% for ppc in the end, it will come down, but they are definitely doing better than the greens. so a high single digit isn't out of question.",conservatives

don't forget that many cpc voters would view a coalition government with the ndp as a deal with the devil (some of them would mean that literally), so o'toole would take a huge hit in his party for doing that deal and then dissolving the government.

a principal residence tax seems like a good idea to me, although i imagine most homeowners would be staunchly opposed. i think a speculation tax would be a great way to help maximize the utility of our land. with regards to realtors, i support an end to blind bidding. past that i’m not sure what else can be done about realtors? i think listing homes in an open auction would remove a lot of their utility. i don’t think it should be a one time tax as it is in ontario and would be better served being more like the bc vacancy and speculation tax. even better in my opinion would be land taxes to make it less economically viable to hoard undeveloped land or vacant housing. the ndp do have a luxury goods tax in their platform but i’m not sure of the details. i personally support a ban on foreign ownership as long as pr are exempted. the wealth tax is on wealth over $10mil which i would prefer to drop significantly. i don’t know if it needs to be much higher than 1% but i certainly wouldn’t be opposed to something higher, especially in the short term. i agree the capital gains inclusion rate should be 100% although i think that should apply at all income levels. i’m not sure why someone earning $60k through income should be taxed more harshly than someone earning $60k through investments. i’m not sure how liberal housing policy is harsher than ndp policy, although i haven’t really read a whole lot of what they propose since it’s only been out for 2 days and is on a difficult to navigate website. they have had 6 years to implement useful housing policy and have failed so far. i really don’t expect them to change that now.",liberals

¹ canada is pretty much middle of the pack in health outcomes among developed countries, and similar for per capita costs.  i'm sure there is some wastage that could be trimmed, but i suspect we're well into diminishing returns trying to do more with less.  looking at the strain our healthcare system has been put under in the last year, realistically we'll be spending more on it for a few years at least.

our neighbour to the south is not part of this comparison.  they're such an outlier, it's useless to use the us for any sort of healthcare insight.  my scale of reference for costs and outcomes has the extremes at france, switzerland, australia, etc.

if you look at switzerland and germany though, their per capita healthcare costs are a fair bit higher than ours, but outcomes are only a little better.  i think that if we were able to increase healthcare costs close to half the difference to switzerland and germany, we could vastly improve our performance.",liberals

hcrap7t,2021-09-13T10:09:56.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] hard to say as they don't exactly spell it out, but if i'd have to take a guess, at that time att's (authorization to transport) were manually done so every single firearm purchase, every single firearm sale, every single request to move a firearm, every single ownership transfer request, had to be done over the phone and approved by a person. with some 9 million firearms in the country at that time, and x% needing an att or att renewal, it eats a lot of resources with precisely zero public safety benefit.

specific to the ontario cfo (chief firearms officer, the agent for the rcmp), every licensee's test had to first be sent to them separate of the application to get an approval stamp... then sent back to the licensee only for the licensee to send it back to them along with the full application. with a few tens of thousands of new applicants every year, that eats a lot of time and resources from a department who's budget is regularly reduced.

imo, registration is up there with the other expensive and time-consuming regulations with minimal benefit. the handgun registry has existed since 1934, yet they can't trace (both to canada and abroad) upwards of over 2/3 of firearms seized. of the ones they do, between ~54-93% came from out of the country anyways. the long-gun registry cost $2b dollars over it's 10yr life with negligible conclusive benefit; i can't imagine what the rreg cost since 1934.

edit: i, and many others, to this day are reporting their references as never being contacted - even spouses - which is in breach of requirements. i wouldn't be surprised is background checks are limited too (contrary to what trudeau and blair say, yes, background checks do go back to the beginning of time; they're only limited to five years for mental health reports). i have to believe the rcmp/cfo would do this only because they're undermanned and therefore don't have enough time/money to fully follow the current requirements of the law. so while i'm sure harper's elimination of the manual att helped significantly, high demand for applications and probably low funding kept things bottlenecked. trudeau's idiotic rollbacks won't help the situation in the slightest as clearly they can't keep up with the original law.",liberals

you have a good point here, but unfortunately when it comes to the automotive sector, even if we manage to develop vast hydrogen infrastructure for cars (despite huge hurdles that involves cost, saftey, transporting hydrogen and etc) we really don't have many automakers except a few making hydrogen cars because hydrogen fuel cell technology is very expensive, and as i said, the fuel cell when converts hydrogen into electricity to power the hydrogen car uses rare materials like platinum which is very valuable, expensive and it's a rare material. the use of platinum is just an example, the cost of fueling a hydrogen car is very expensive, it's not as cheap is charging with electricity or fueling with petrol/gas.

currently, we only have 1 automaker making a hydrogen car and investing seriously into it which is toyota, while bev technology is what the rest of the market believes as the future. even if we develop infrastructure, there won't be many hydrogen cars to use such infrastructure, thus, it's a loss for the owners who developed the hydrogen infrastructure.

coming back to the home heating point once again, as we move towards an electric future, i won't be surprised if we use electricity even for home heating, but yes, instead of relying in one source, using hydrogen for example is a nice option and i would call it viable, but when it comes to cars, we need a lot of hydrogen = huge expense, adding up to one of the many hurdles of hydrogen cars.

there was no competitive alternative. the technology and scale of production necessary to offer an economically reasonable alternative to more emissions intensive products and services didn’t exist yet. 

canada is not a large market and canadian demand alone would not have been sufficient to spark the changes necessary to make those alternatives competitive. there was a point, probably in the past couple of years, when technology and production capacity caught up to aspiration and we reached the point where a carbon tax can be an effective tool to direct consumer demand towards alternatives. prior to that inflection point, however, it would have just been a cost because, even with the added expense of the tax, any alternatives would have still been more expensive. we could have ratcheted the tax up to account for that, but then we would’ve been making daily life unsustainably expensive for many many families all to achieve an insignificant reduction in global ghg emissions.",conservatives

so the public responded by rallying around the one opposition party left standing, the ndp that was normally a fringe also ran who just happened to have a suprisingly talented leader in place.

one of the consequences of this is if the ndp gets into government for a 2nd time under notley, they're going to be in a much stronger position to govern compared to the previous attempt. consolidation of the centre-left ahead of time means their organization and candidate recruitment will be much better and they'll be able to tap more experienced people.",liberals

gurey1n,2021-04-16T05:43:38.000-07:00,"how the four main federal parties’ climate plans stack up now that the conservatives have released a plan which includes modelling from navius, showing that the proposed policies are stringent enough to hit the current paris 2030 target (like the liberal plan), i'm curious whether the ndp will put something similar on the table. the ndp has set a more ambitious goal, and listed a number of actions, but without modelling, it doesn't seem likely that the actions are at all adequate to hit the target.

a big advantage of the liberal plan (besides its already being in place) is that if scientists tell us we need to make the target more ambitious, the carbon price can go up faster. the liberal plan can also pick up the complementary flexible regulations that the conservatives have proposed.

[economist andrew leach and climate scientist katherine hayhoe](https://www.chatelaine.com/living/politics/2019-federal-election-climate/), writing before the 2019 election:

&gt; the ndp’s plan is ambitious. it argues firmly for meeting canada’s obligations consistent with a global 1.5 degrees c climate change target rather than the less ambitious (but still challenging) 2 degrees c target that underpinned the paris agreement. they plan to do so through an emphasis on expanding training and education for clean energy jobs, along with investing in zero-carbon housing and transportation and eliminating canada’s fossil fuel subsidies which, according to the imf, average around $220,000 per second at the global scale.
&gt;
&gt; here’s the problem, though — the plan doesn’t explain how they’re going to cut canada’s emissions by 40-50 percent in the next 10 years. it’s also unclear how they’re going to navigate the already tricky issue of provincial versus federal jurisdiction.
&gt;
&gt; not to get too wonky, but if jagmeet singh is going to argue that provinces should be able to veto a federally approved pipeline project, it’s hard to understand how he’ll be able to impose a wholesale replacement of a province’s electricity generating assets in 10 years when, unlike pipelines, electricity actually is provincial jurisdiction.
&gt;
&gt; further complicating their plan is the fact that a lot of the subsidies they’ve pledged to remove are provincial tax policies. plus, the labour wing of the ndp might be swayed by the talk of green jobs, but their pledge to remove competitiveness protections from carbon pricing will increase the challenges faced by industries like refining, steel, fertilizer, and other operations with union workforces.

they say that the green plan seems detailed but unrealistic:

&gt; as you’d expect, the green party is informed and honest regarding the extent to which our economy will have to be transformed in order to meet canada’s most ambitious climate targets. their plan also goes into some detail regarding how this transformation might be achieved. however, the proposed target, a reduction of 60 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, implies a 4 percent average reduction in emissions per year. in recent history, emissions have only dropped that fast during the global financial crisis. how likely is it that they can realize their ambitions?
&gt;
&gt; here are just three examples of the challenge posed by their 2030 goals. first, the green plan calls for the phase-out of all fossil fuel power—not just coal-fired power—in just over 10 years. our electricity sector is already very clean; but replacing 20 percent of our electricity generation in a 10-year span (80 percent for alberta, including plants integrated into oil sands and petrochemical plants) in an area that is solidly within provincial jurisdiction is not going to be easy.
&gt;
&gt; second, the plan also pledges to rebuild the electricity grid linking canadian provinces with the infrastructure to support renewable power. the regulatory and interjurisdictional wrangling over such a plan could take 10 years in and of itself.
&gt;
&gt; and lastly, it aims for 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2030, a goal not quite as ambitious as norway but which would still require a very rapid transition of the fleet and charging infrastructure. it’s doable, but it’s going to require more than just car sales: charging infrastructure and grid upgrades will be required in spades to support such a change.",conservatives

it will drive up much muchmore than just ful prices.  food prices, all your every day products , the housing market, amenities, literally everything will go up. 

maybe you live in a recession proof city like toronto or vancouver, where these won’t take as much effect. but for those of us in rural communities, especiallyaboriginal and inuit , it will make the already exhorbitant costs unaffordable.

there is also no green alternative! if they had an alternative form of energy that was just as efficient i would be for it, but as it is it’s just going to increase the cost of living for all of us without actually making any impact on climate change.

what you think putin or biden are gonna see canada and be like “oh they taxed themselves into poverty with their green energy intitiative. we should do the same!!” 

like no. that’s absolutely asinine, naive and not representative of reality.

&gt;yet that is not why lockdowns have been so endless. again and again, the premiers of the worst-hit provinces — almost all conservatives of some variety — have waited too long to impose public health restrictions, and have been too quick to lift them. 

there's no need to make this so partisan. premiers of all political stripes have been slow to lock down, with the exception of the maritime premiers. 

bc, for example, is lead by a ndp goverment, but it has a 37% higher case per 100k than ontario, pretty meaningful context, but that wouldn't be useful for the author's agenda.

&gt;using the power of government to pay people to stay home during a pandemic, or even just when people are sick, is too much for these leaders. giving people something might lead them to realize better things are possible

again, the ndp in bc are actually celebrating the same federal legislation that the ontario provincial government are relying on, in their article '*9 pretty good things that happened in 2020*'. from the bc ndp's website: 

&gt;this year premier john horgan pushed the federal government to make sure workers could afford to stay home sick or isolate with covid-19 — and this fall, the canada recovery sickness benefit was created. it’s one step closer to the national paid sick leave program we all deserve.

all that being said, i don't think most provincial governments have done a good job at containing the pandemic. my point here is that this article is needlessly politicizing the pandemic, and is basically lying by omission to craft a political narrative. many other media outlets are guilty of this too. if you find yourself reading this article and nodding along with it, you should consider how the media is using your biases to manipulate you.",conservatives

gnnq8ve,2021-02-16T00:11:22.000-08:00,"trudeau government would allow municipalities to ban handguns under new bill with zero actual legal enforceability. municipalities are creatures of the province under the constitution. provinces can simply prohibit municipalities from doing so and/or render any such municipal by-law null and void. worst case, they legislate them out of existence.

yet another example of trudeau virtue signaling. criminals don't care about \"bans\", and ownership or purchase of guns other than hunting rifles are already extremely controlled and restricted, it's nearly impossible already to legally buy one.",liberals

gnnqivo,2021-02-16T00:13:27.000-08:00,"five reasons why trudeau will still be running canada in a few months time i don't think many people on the left end of the political spectrum are going to deny the existence of white privilege, if that's what you're driving at. 

this really just strikes me as a distraction. in the context of a likely successor to the liberals, it doesn't make much sense to criticize the left as a predominantly white political group, when that describes every political party. that's the society we live in, and you can at least put your finger on good faith, imperfect efforts by progressives to improve things. 

are they sometimes going to be hypocritical about it? of course. but you have to compare them to a realistic alternative. since we're talking about a hypothetical successor to the liberals, that leaves the bloc and the ucp, both of which have recently supported overtly discriminatory policies.

all this to say, you missed the key part: *to the exclusion of others.*",liberals

it's kind of a meme at this point that singh doesn't understand the actual powers/role that the federal government has relative to provincial powers, but stuff like kind of lends an uncomfortable validity to it. 

trudeau isn't trump; he isn't going to deny support to the provinces on this sort of thing because of some sort of grudge, and if a province were to request help in the form of the military, i'm sure it would be provided. it's possibly, even likely, that it's been brought up in the premiers meeting.",liberals
