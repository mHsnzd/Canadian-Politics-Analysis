https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/news/opinion/trudeau-government-plays-politics-with-pardon-reform/357330

&gt; the trudeau government has long known the pardon system is broken and in need of fixing. way back in 2016, public safety minister ralph goodale vowed to overhaul canada’s pardon system, calling the changes made by the harper government a “punitive measure.”

&gt; and yet, for over half a decade, the government sat on its hands and did absolutely nothing to overhaul the criminal records act, even after aspects of it were found unconstitutional by courts in ontario and british columbia.

&gt;if the government were serious about reform and not just messaging, they would have introduced legislation in a timelier manner. they could have adopted one of the two bills that senator kim pate introduced, making pardons free and automatic.  

&gt; heck, legislation is not even necessary to reduce the application fee; that can be done with a simple pen stroke through regulation.

&gt; so, forgive those who see this late new pardon legislation as a cynical bit of pre-election politicking.

in other words, just like the electoral reform promised by the liberals in 2016, we'll believe it when we see it.",liberals

on the other hand climate change seems to have become a giant whip used to force leftwing policy. you have to understand that agreeing with climate change also means i have to agree with every other item on the socialist wishlist because they have all been wrapped into a single package. because of this i simply can't go along with it. we need to find a solution that isn't going to result in more deaths than climate change itself. i can't agree with shutting down the oil industry because we don't have replacements for plastics. we can't use solar because the areas they are building solar are actually needed to grow food. there are unintended consequences in every action that is the purpose of going slow and seeing the result. when i see crap like the green new deal it makes me wonder if proponents of climate action even care about the consequences or maybe the end goal is to kill off half the world's population through famine.",conservatives

internment rates world war 1

&gt; according to official records, 8,579 men were held at 24 internment camps and receiving stations across canada. this included 5,954 men of austro-hungarian origin, the majority of whom were ukrainian. there were also 2,009 germans, 205 turks, and 99 bulgarians. some dependents of the male internees — 81 women and 156 children in total — were also voluntarily interned. other internees included homeless people, conscientious objectors, and members of outlawed cultural and political associations.

&gt; around 80,000 people, mostly ukrainian canadians, were obliged to register as “enemy aliens” during the war. they were compelled to report regularly to the police and were subjected to other state-sanctioned censures. these included restrictions of their freedom of speech, as well as their movement and association.


internment rates world war 2 

&gt; the army and the secretary of state shared administrative responsibility for internment camps. more than 40 camps held around 24,000 people in total. a total of 26 internment camps were in ontario, quebec, alberta	and new brunswick. (see also prisoner of war camps in canada.)

&gt; most of the german canadian internees were members of german-sponsored organizations. some were leaders of the national unity party (the canadian nazi party). hundreds of germans on canadian soil were accused of spying and subversion.

&gt; the camps also housed captured enemy soldiers. more than 700 german sailors captured in east asia were sent to canada. german immigrants who had arrived in canada after 1922 were also forced to register with the authorities; 16,000 did so. (see also prisoner of war camps in canada.)

&gt; after italy entered the war in june 1940, several prominent italians were interned. around 600 italian men suspected of sympathizing with fascism were placed into three camps: kananaskis, alberta; petawawa,  ontario; and fredericton, new brunswick. some 31,000 italian canadians were registered as enemy aliens. they were forced to report to local registrars or to rcmp	stations once a month.

&gt; in the summer of 1940, more than 3,000 refugees — among them 2,300 german and austrian jews aged 16 to 60 — were sent to canada. they were interned in guarded camps in ontario, quebec and new brunswick. the jews in the group came to be known as the “accidental immigrants.” they were initially interned in prisoner of war (pow) camps alongside actual  pows, including nazi germans.

&gt; on 24 february 1942, cabinet ordered japanese canadians to move 100 miles inland from the pacific coast. the order led to the expulsion of some 21,000 japanese canadians from their homes. sixty per cent were canadian born and 77 per cent were canadian citizens. they were divided by sex, and housed together on cots in a former women’s building and in livestock barns on the grounds of the pacific national exhibition.

about alcohol restrictions they are a part of classic toryism. classic toryism is different from american conservatism. american conservatism has been heavily influenced by liberalism, whereas classic toryism, such as what we had in canada, was born out of a desire to preserve old european social structures. classic toryism was paternalistic. hence classic toryism wasn’t afraid to use government authority. not just government authority for economic goals, as previously stated, but for enforcing traditional social morals as well.",conservatives

as for cerb, a lot of people didn’t need the help that badly. canada already has existing programs like ei and welfare to help people in need. i paid my employees with canada’s cash and pocketed the profits, like every business in canada. the pandemic was a bonanza of free money for business owners.

hnlfwrm,2021-12-06T22:17:57.000-08:00,"brian jean holds slight lead over jason kenney for preferred ucp leader come election time: leger poll couldn't be less true.  first off classic liberalism is not an absence of values, but a belief that the gov't shouldn't be imposing it's perceived values on others by force of law. 

and that's basically what current conservatism is. what you're talking about is inflicting a moral belief system derived from an imaginary friend on other people at gunpoint. that's not being 'conservative'. and yes it is religious fanaticism. honest religious belief does not require you to force others to adhere to it. 

\"religious values\" have no place in conservatism.  other than than granting the freedom to practice them privately. 

which isn't to say that a country or a conservative party can't have principles - but  principles are not the same as religious morals. we can all agree on certain things and should, such as that all people should be treated equally or that a man's home is his castle or the like. and some religious morals may happily coincide with the principles we agree to live under. 

but forcing your moral beliefs on someone by force of law is actually more like modern liberal behavior. it's authoritarian, it's socialistic, its' the whole \"social utopia' concept. \"the world would be better if everyone believed as i do and those who don't will be forced to or locked up\". 

if your imaginary friend tells you that you shouldn't have an abortion, i fully support your right to choose not to have one. hell i'll even support spending taxpayer money (which comes from my pocket as well) to make sure that's a viable option for you that's practical. to be honest, personally i think that's the right thing. i don't really support abortion as a 'good idea'. i'd rather see more babies brought to term. 

but - unless you can demonstrate convincingly that a fetus is an actual human with the attached human rights then it simply your belief that this is the case and inflicting that belief on others is just as wrong as requiring others to have an abortion would be. 

 so no.  the conservative party isn't about pandering to religious fanatics who want to impose their views on others by law. you aren't a fanatic just becuase you have religious beliefs even if they are strongly held, but you are one if you think that you should force others to adhere to them just because you believe it.",conservatives

so it is not o'toole that is mixing terms, it has been othera for years to the point people are confused and think that civilians are out there with fully-semi-automatic assault style rifles or whatever new made up terms.

you could argue the mass shootings in the states and canada justify stuff, but again you would be wrong as the simple facts are less then 50% of mass shootings in the us, use a rifle, and they account for less then 2% of overall shootings. even in canada the amount of legal firearms owned by licensed gun owners is the minority of firearms used in illegal shootings. even general crime is far less likely to be committed by licensed firearms owners.",conservatives

abortion access (make it harder)
gay marriage (artificially restrict it)
reconciliation (what reconciliation)

obviously this isn’t all of the politicians, but overall the tories tend to oppose *justice* in the name of “conservative values”. i do not see how legislating who can get married and who cannot as being small government. telling doctors they’re not allowed to perform surgeries that they want to, and women that they *must* give birth (and usually tories do very little to support new mothers) is not small government. denying the historical genocide of the first nations is just them being shitty humans, it has nothing to do with governance.

as for your other points, that’s true, those *are* small government economic approaches. the problem is that they do *not* benefit the people, and allow us to be abused by other powerful groups.

i think it’s fair to say that “small-government” folks distrust the government. think it is too large, corrupt, or ineffectual, right? *but* who is corrupting the government? in canada i think we can all agree that our telecoms take us for a ride, hey? highest prices and worst service in the west (pretty much).

that’s because it’s these large companies that buy politicians (across the spectrum), leading to the corruption we all see. but we (the people) have no power to change corporate policies, we don’t get to vote for their board members or policies. that’s where government regulations are *supposed* to come in. sometimes companies are too large and corrupt as well, and the government is the peoples tool to change that! there is such a thing as *too much* regulation, but we are far far *far* closer to the point of having not *enough*. hence canadians growing dissatisfaction with government, it’s an unfortunate and vicious cycle.

cutting taxes also disproportionately benefits the extremely wealthy, tory tax cuts are in fact *designed* to. they may help us in the short term, but long term i kinda wish we had more money for things like healthcare, pandemic response, heck, *roads* are pretty nice! i’m bitter about what happened to the 407, which is a *blatant* example of corruption. 

my problem is that it seems like the “small-government” politicians seem to really be advocating for *no* government power, *no* regulations, and damn near *no* effective taxation of corporations and the wealthy. these positions are nonsensical, because they are absolutes. there absolutely *are* some industries where the existence of a real crown corp would benefit canadians as a whole by *forcing* companies to compete for once. any industry where the base cost is too high for any non-billionaire to start a competing company should have a federal equivalent in my mind. 

break the telecom oligopoly - saskatchewan has *great* service and low costs thanks to sasktel. break the bloody irving’s practical monopoly on the east coast gas. stop airlines *gouging* us at ever bloody step. 

the lack of competition in these industries means that the “invisible hand” meant to direct the market doesn’t really exist any more. they’re free to rip us off and hold us hostage because we have no alternatives! that’s where i think the government should step in.",conservatives

one, our immigration system (especially in more recent years) biases towards younger, highly educated immigrants who often have far more liberal beliefs than the majority view in their home countries. 

two, 'social conservatism' means very different things in different countries and cultures; in north america, there is obviously a strong christian/evangelical slant to hot-button socon issues, which doesn't always translate particularly well to a lot of other conservative cultures.

finally - and this is key - the conservatives have to constantly fight the perception of being the anti-immigration party. canadian conservatives at the party level have generally been in favour of immigration, but for better or for worse, the party does harbor individuals who are seen to be demonizing or scapegoating recent immigrants. the constant association with us republicans only exacerbates this perception problem.

which generally means you're part of a group of people who are very interested in pushing left wing or liberal propaganda.  if you said anything about being even mildly conservative or disagreeing with their dogma they would generally disavow you.


&gt;strongly support same sex marriage

why?  aside from legal reasons which could be accomplished regardless of using the term marriage, do you think it legitimizes gay relationships somehow?  it's a moot point as it's already legal, but it's always seemed to me an uneccessary pursuit.  

&gt;equal adoption chance

do you think it's in the best interest of a child to have both a mother and father? what does equal adoption chance mean to you specifically?  that gay couples should be treated equally to straight couples when it comes to adoption?  in which case do you not think the best interest of the child is unnecessary?

&gt;and being able to transition to the opposite sex (and be treated as one aside from very few situations like medical ones where birth sex is relevant). 

do you think people should be forced to play along with what the lgbt organizations demand under penalty of law?  or do you think it should be left to an individuals personal decisions?  do you believe people should be forced by law to use others pronouns? do you think trans people should be allowed in female only spaces like abuse shelters?  do you think if they aren't allowed in that the abuse shelters should be shut down?  if you do any of the above, i don't think you're very conservative by most peoples metric.

&gt;i believe one should be able to medically do so once you are past the age of consent. 

do you think canadian taxpayers should pay for such surgery even if it causes medical complications and does not really accomplish what it's supposed to beyond a superficial level?  should children be allowed to take hormone blockers?  with or without their guardians permission?  do you agree with the notion our schools are overly pushing lgbt dogma/propaganda on young impressionable minds?  

&gt;i’m unsure of my opinion on non binary, but will call someone they if asked to. i don’t believe that there are any other genders that have any type of scientific validity behind them (some studies have been able to find transgenderism in brain scans but no other genders). i don’t believe people should be forced to agree with lgbt as long as they can give them equal respect.\"

i don't know what this means.  respect isn't something you can legislate.  not in a free country.  

do you agree with bill c-10?  that we need to fund canadian content and have the crtc involved in every aspect of the internet?  then you wouldn't be a conservative you'd be in the other 3 major parties.   

do you think weed becoming legalized has lead to people abusing that newfound privilege?  smoking near school grounds?  do you think there should at least be restrictions on people the same way there are restrictions on tobacco?

now if you disagree with me but still respect my right to an opinion different than yours, maybe you're a conservative despite that.  or at least, conservatism is the only party currently that will dare to have the debate.",conservatives

so yes, because you have population growth [2.3x the next closest g7 country](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-215-x/2019001/c-g/c-g1.2-eng.png) while [we built more homes in the 1970s](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410013501&amp;pickmembers%5b0%5d=1.1&amp;pickmembers%5b1%5d=4.1&amp;cubetimeframe.startmonth=07&amp;cubetimeframe.startyear=1948&amp;cubetimeframe.endmonth=07&amp;cubetimeframe.endyear=2021&amp;referenceperiods=19480701%2c20210701)(in absolute terms!) we're in a bit of a pickle.

but here are some ideas:

1. cut income tax for low earners and introduce a federal property tax
2. attach conditions to every single federal grant to a province or city. if you're not on track to reach the g7 average of properties / capita by 2031 you don't get a dollar
3. have ofsi say only principal residences are eligible for mortgages
4. have ofsi focus on loan to income ratios instead of gds.
5. have ofsi end the ability for rental income to be included in gds
6. end principal residence exemption, or at the very least cap it to the average home price in 2000, inflation adjusted
7. decrease immigration, with targets of housing construction for when we can go back to previous levels
8. introduce the three fs for rentals: you cannot be evicted for any reason whatsoever, you may sublease to your heart's desire, rent is capped at inflation. how can the feds do this? easy 100% inclusion of capital gains on properties which don't follow this.
9. end visas for foreign students for universities in urban areas with average home price to income above 3x.

herqa9h,2021-09-29T06:53:40.000-07:00,"what do you think the cpc's strategy relating to québec ought to be? in a perfect world, the cpc and bq would ally with each other like the cdu/csu in germany. unfortunately, i think the bq are too leftwing and anti-o&amp;g for that. 

instead, i think that the cpc should try to maintain it's stronghold in and around quebec city but allow the bq to win regions that would otherwise go to the liberals. 

i also agree that the cpc should try to be pro-decentralized federalism and provincial autonomy, not because of quebec, but because it's a generally conservative position. i'd like to see the fed neutered since i don't believe in allowing the laurentian elite in ottawa, toronto and montreal making decisions for the rest of the country. 

it also allows people with certain ideological or cultural beliefs to move to a province that aligns with their values. for example, i'd like move to alberta since i'm conservative; not having to deal with the federal government just incentivizes me to do so even more.

in terms of bill 21 and 96, it's a sticky situation. i don't personally agree with them and believe that they are both gross violations of our rights. that said, i feel like the courts are going to be more effective/successful at dealing with them than federal interference will be. bill 101 at the federal level is just retarded considering 4 in 5 canadians are anglophone.

edit: i was mistaken on what bill 96 is. i thought it was the bill that blocks protesters from protesting in front of certain public spaces (e.g. hospitals), not the one that is toughening up french language laws.",liberals

an individual's religion is actually not assumed to be political in the rest of canada, and hasn't been for a long time. perhaps in quebec, having only separated its political and religious systems ~60 years ago, it is still common to assume political views based on religion. but if that's the case, bill 21 is an inferior solution to that problem, because it makes more sense for people to stop assuming a person's religion and politics are linked than it does to try to remove visible clues to what a person's religion (and therefore their politics) are. 

&gt;deciding to display one's religion is a way to endorse the message of that religion and the person seeing that endorsement can't know what part of the message the wearer disagrees with.

sure, i guess it could be an endorsement of what *you understand* the message if that religion to be, and you can't know whether the person agrees with what you believe the region's message to be. 

in fact, i think you'll find that the \"message\" of any religion will be different to each of its adherents. at least that's been my experience when i ask people.",conservatives

hp09b7a,2021-12-17T11:24:33.000-08:00,"trudeau calls on canadians to \"starve\" omicron by following public health guidance over the winter i don't believe anymore that following all this guidance made much of a difference. every jurisdiction seems to cycle through waves, no matter how on top of things they were at one time. kingston being the most recent example. they have never really showed us anything tangible that says that following the guidelines had demonstrable results. except maybe lockdowns and that's not a sustainable solution.

the best i hope for is the virus will play out like they say they all do, and settle on a form that infects more people less seriously. i think the \"unprecedented\" narrative has been unfortunate; they won't let go of it, and the people who are supposedly navigating us out of \"this unprecedented situation\" sound increasingly unhinged.

it haunts me that someday they will look at something we did based on the experts saying \"you gotta do this\" and realize that it was that very thing that kept the pandemic going. 

does anyone think there might be high level discussions about a plan b that pivots away from what they've been doing for two years? because i don't think this is working, and i can't be the only one. i see no point in the insanity of doing the same things over and over again.",liberals
