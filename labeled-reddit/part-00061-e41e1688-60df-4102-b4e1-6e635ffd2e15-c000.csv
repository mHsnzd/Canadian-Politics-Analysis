so if tommy douglas also changed as that other user pointed out to you, why doesn't he get the same pass as trudeau in your mind? he also brought us universal healthcare. that's obviously been a far greater benefit to canada than anything trudeau has ever done.

&gt;all the while he's been working his whole adult life to bring about greater equality between disadvantaged people of colour.

what exactly has he done to do this? our indigenous people in canada still don't have clean water. unless you meant working to talk a lot about it or kneeling in protests for photos while enacting zero relevant policies? i'd agree he does an excellent job at that.

b) reasoned criticism of islam (and other religions, political beliefs, cultural practices) is not indicative of bigotry

c) that it does a disservice to the quality of dialogue we can have about the direction of our society to conflate the two and that labeling people with an unsavoury term like this is often a tool used to shut down argument from those who want to appear to win a discussion without saying anything substantive.

i say this as a green party member married to someone who grew up in a muslim household. i wish our politicians would stand up and unequivocally say bigotry and hatred are bad, but having an issue with a set of ideas doesn't automatically equate to those things


immediate edit: i also genuinely believe that this kind of messaging would lead to fewer people being sucked into these crazy alt-right echo chambers and long term lead to some more substantive dialogue and less polarization. (particularly intergenerationally) - a lot of younger canadians with family history in this country have parents and grandparents with shitty values that we need to progress from and new immigrant families have shitty values they need to progress from. our youth would fare far better at moving forward if criticism of one was not protected while criticism of the other becomes the national pastime. all this does is serve to polarize, strengthen groupthink and foment resentment across those groups.",conservatives

tragedy ought to be even more political. many tragedies are caused by social issues that are solvable by government action. in this case, right-wing radicalization. if you don’t look into the underlying reasons for a problem, which are often political, you can’t take any meaningful action to solve the issue; this being a political process.

so my point is, if we don’t want this to happen again then we need to take it seriously as a function of politics and do something about the underlying issues causing tragedies like these.",conservatives

gyrk33o,2021-05-19T10:34:44.000-07:00,"trudeau and biden continue support for israeli apartheid despite public pressure &gt;i think using terms like apartheid and genocide are not productive to the argument. it creates a gulf between the camps that cannot be bridged. once you say that israel is committing genocide, you can no longer compromise. and in this situation, compromise is exactly what's needed.

if a genocide or an apartheid are what's happening, i feel like that needs to be named. the policies enacted by israel in both that country and in palestinian territory directly reflect policies enacted in apartheid south africa, and the attitude towards west bank settlement and gazan military action reflect many genocides in the past, including the displacement tactics employed by both canada and the us during their colonial periods.

i say that israel is committing a genocide and is an apartheid state not because i want to sow division, but because those are *accurate statements*. ignoring that fact is a disservice to palestinians who are suffering at the hands of an oppressive regime that wants them gone. 

&gt;it's a complex problem. israel was created partly in response to genocide. there are many of its neighbours that would gladly commit another one against the jews and wipe their country and people off the map. you can't approach the problem without taking that into account.

it's not nearly as complex a problem as you think. israel has been engaged in a steady campaign of settling in the west bank since the 1967 war, and despite numerous conflicts with palestinians who opposed that agenda and despite israel signing the oslo accords, in which they agreed to no longer settle land in the west bank, they've chosen to do so anyways. at the same time they have created a blockade by sea and by land of gaza to the point where the region is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. it has one of the highest unemployment rates, infant mortality rates, and depression/suicide rates globally, all of which only being made worse by the fact that the israeli military routinely destroys their hospitals, schools, and civilian infrastructure biannually.

as for israel's enemies in the region, they have pacts with their major military adversaries (egypt and saudi arabia) as part of each of those countries' alignment with the united states, so they're not really at much risk these days, which is evidenced by the fact that they have gone to war against virtually none of those countries for decades. and even if it were the case that they had enemies, it's worth noting that none of those enemies included palestinians until israel began targeting them specifically. hamas only evolved into the political and military force it is today thanks to continued israeli involvement in palestinian politics and self-governance.

furthermore, i don't believe that the risk of enemies in the region really excuses many of the policies employed by israel in palestine anyways. palestinians are subjected to a second class status in their own land, with everything from road access to availability of water, food and medical supplies being limited with priority for israelis. i don't understand how \"having enemies in the region\" provides justification for israel's treatment of palestinians.

&gt;casting israel as the bad guys and hamas as the good guys is problematic, to say the least. i hope people with a better appreciation of the complexity of the problem than i have, can apply themselves to solving it.

i hate to say it, but israel *are the bad guys* in this situation, which is not to say hamas are the *good guys* per se. rather, it's helpful to understand hamas as a reaction to israeli policy in palestine, from which they derive a great deal of their political ideology and policy positions themselves. it's not just a bunch of bloodthirsty terrorists in hamas, in fact they are better known in palestine as a political party that won their most recent parliamentary elections. (it should be noted that israel opposed these election results by arresting half of palestine's parliament, including several moderates who were opposed to any military retaliation against israel. many have suggested this was a move by israel to aggravate tensions in the region by framing the only representatives of hamas to be extremists.)",liberals

if garbage is getting dumped on your street, that doesn't suddenly grant you a moral *carte blanch* to dump your own garbage. just because someone is screwing up more, doesn't suddenly mean it's okay to screw up.

this is just a further example of the modern conservative ethos - fuck you, i got mine. you see no value in reducing pollution - which, per capita, we are one of the worst offenders on the planet - because it might affect your personal life.

yes, the us and china need to step up and reduce their emissions - but we need to do so as well. if we take all the countries with 2% or less (countries which you think should just do nothing) and add them together, that group contributes over 40% of global co2 emissions. if all these countries adopt a climate plan as callous and shortsighted as yours, we'll never make significant strides towards climate change mitigation.

i thought you conservatives loved to preach about personal responsibility? why is it you love to shirk your personal responsibility when it comes to pollution and the environment?

i thought you conservatives love to preach about long term economic impacts and against short term gains for long term pain? why do you suddenly ignore this principle when the climate is involved, and the long term destabilization of the globe will produce dire economic consequences into the future?

in canada the answer is pretty obvious - you abandon your vaunted principles when environmental issues occur because the conservative party of canada represents the oil industry and workers. accepting climate change means accepting a simple truth - we have to eventually leave some of our oil in the ground. unable to accept that, denial is the next best thing.

of course now denial doesn't work anymore, so you have to accept climate change. what's the next step? denial of the solutions, denial of a solution - for a party born of the oil sands can never abandon it, but must instead craft policy and messaging to protect it. if you can no longer deny the truth right in front of you, you create your own - \"we can't possibly do anything, so let's not\".

and i sincerely hope the party continues down that road, honestly. the cpc is fast becoming the bloc prairies - unable to connect with city voters that decide elections, and unable to change their messaging for fear of reprisal from their core base.",conservatives

i believe this is very complex. it's not that the communities are not provided solutions and potable drinking water, it's the fact that when they are provided these amenities, they are not maintained or manned.  i've been told from some government workers who work with ingidenous reserves that they pay and install systems for potable water, but they are not manned to continue compliance, maintaned or sometimes the money used for these systems are not internally used for this purpose. often, the cash flows to the chief or elder in charge and it doesn't always make it's way to support the rest of the communities. these are internal politics that the federal and provincial governments can't control. not saying this is the case everywhere, but more often than the average citizen is made aware of.",liberals

it's extremely troubling that in a country that calls itself a democracy that the flow of information is almost universally controlled by private interests, with zero public oversight and zero regulation on how ownership of media organizations ought to work. postmedia also has a history of \"endorsing candidates\" in elections, which i'm sure has some influence on voting patterns, and given it's a canadian megacorporation with much to lose from more equitable policy, they tend to endorse the conservatives in all their publications nationwide.

[backgrounder](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2020/11/supporting-a-stronger-more-inclusive-and-more-competitive-broadcasting-system.html) from canadian heritage.

dale smith, [roundup: some of the misconceptions around c-10](https://www.routineproceedings.com/2021/05/29/roundup-some-of-the-misconceptions-around-c-10/).

dale smith, [careful when regulating web giants as broadcasters](https://nationalmagazine.ca/en-ca/articles/law/in-depth/2021/the-pitfalls-of-regulating-web-giants-as-broadcast).

&gt; guilbeault says that the original version of c-10 dealt with social media in two ways: in section 2.1, it provided that individuals who upload content on social media platforms, such as facebook or tiktok, aren't considered broadcasters.
&gt; 
&gt; \"this means you and i can't be regulated by the crtc,\" he says. \"we've kept that clause.\"
&gt; 
&gt; the provision which has received more scrutiny is section 4.1, which initially excluded social media platforms from the category of broadcasters.
&gt; 
&gt; \"based on the testimonies heard during the committee process, we realized that that exclusion was too broad as it excluded platforms like youtube when they act as music streamers,\" says guilbeault. \"that's why we've removed 4.1.\"
&gt; 
&gt; various cultural groups across the country supported removing section 4.1, including the alliance of canadian cinema, television and radio artists – or actra.
&gt; 
&gt; \"actra is of the view that individuals who use social media to transmit programs for non-commercial purposes should be excluded from the application of the broadcasting act,\" says david sparrow, actra national president, in a written response to cba national. \"this is why it supports the new section 2.1 in bill c-10. section 4.1, however, provided a blanket exemption to social media platforms – as distinct from their users – from the application of the broadcasting act.\"
&gt; 
&gt; the trouble, says sparrow, is that social media platforms produce professional cultural content, like music. also, facebook has broadcast major league baseball games, twitter has introduced live broadcasting, and both youtube and facebook have entered the scripted content market.
&gt; 
&gt; \"while both have now stepped back from creating original programming, there is no reason to assume they may not resume creating scripted content in the future,\" says sparrow. \"if these or other social media platforms evolve to become primary distributors of professional content, it should be open to the crtc to capture that activity under the ambit of the broadcasting act. \"
&gt; 
&gt; sparrow says that actra supports giving the crtc the broad scope to determine how and when to regulate social media under the broadcasting act, subject to transparent and thorough public consultations and hearings.",liberals

but you can read more about it in lots of places. for example, the gov't took back control and the maintenance of the residential schools from the churches in 69 to 78. trudeau was prime minister from 68 to 79. so he had all the power and access to the schools to find out what was going on and what had gone on..... and didn't give a crap. 

during that time according to the truth and reconciliation reports 7 brand new schools were opened up (although i believe 3 were just to expand existing ones and allow for the amalgamation of them, so lets say 4).  

so trudeau was a big fan of the residential schools and had complete authority over them, which wasn't the case previously as prior gov'ts had basically foisted the system off to the catholic church.

talking to someone that did this, they do stuff like make voldemort in harry potter appear in a strange font. cool. that makes it a bit more interesting to read, but that hardly justifies the hours/days involved in manually processing a book.

the availability of this tech should have absolutely collapsed the cost of doing this. instead of having a team of people working on books, you literally just need a printer that can handle braille and bind books available at a library... library staff are more than competent to be able to handle software to convert the ebook to braille.",liberals

you keep shifting from topic to topic and confusing the discussion, but what we're talking about already exists.  we already have algorithms that can allocate capital on the stock market better than individuals.  the stock market is not a small detail, as it holds trillions of dollars.  we also have giant pension funds that are quasi-public like cpp and the ontario teacher's pension plan.  

many countries have public investment development banks which provide credit and micro-loans to small vendors.  i have seen no evidence that they're doing this any worse than private banks or have lower rates of return.

to say sajjan did nothing is not truthful.

mccrimmon also said that there were other areas where the complaint could have went like a centre for sexual assault/harassment and even to give a formal complaint.

trudeau is backing sajjan and this government does have a history of doing more for victims than the previous harper government.

i can easily pull up articles where the previous harper government did absolutely nothing for their 9 year period on this issue.

even sajjan admitted when being interviewed by solomon and others in the past few weeks.

then there is the issue of political interference which is another aspect that sajjan and his officials and even liberal mps argue that is why things happened the way they did.

sajjan even admitted as such in committee on february 19th, 2021.

he said he was shocked by the reports.

some information out there based on yesterday's article does state that sajjan only knew general information from what walbourne told him, so there is that line where sajjan was shocked on the full extent, so that is a possibility.

it could even be a new allegation from feb. of 2021 versus 2018.

sajjan even disputes what walbourne said, so of course sajjan will be invited to committee, but sajjan again will be evasive. what can sajjan say while an investigation is going on. it will be much of the same.

the government will say it took actions and it was sent to the proper authorities. other than calling sajjan to resign, the government is firmly behind him and they felt they did the right thing. any form of political interference was not wanted with norman or snc, but it seems to have been fine in this case?! hmm, i wonder?!",liberals

[alykhan velshi](https://linkedin.com/in/alykhanvelshi), who's worked for both jason kenney and stephen harper, and who set up ethicaloil.org, has been huawei canada's vice-president of corporate affairs for a couple years now, advising huawei on meng wanzhou's arrest and extradition. this is on his linkedin page:

my guess is that by hiring enwright and then velshi as lobbyists, both long-time conservatives, huawei is trying to influence the cpc's position.

other than maybe taiwan, china and vietnam, can you point me to any country that was out of the crisis after the first 3 months of the crisis?  a lot of us had unrealistic expectations at the beginning.

your point about delaying the second dose is misinformation, there was a study published in the very reputable journal nature published last week which showed delaying the second dose of pfizer for 12 weeks rather than 3 weeks actually increases immunity.  i encourage you to get off erin o'toole's twitter feed and read it: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01299-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01299-y)

second, the decision to delay second doses was made by the naci, an independent agency at arm's length, not the pmo.  this is not russia where government agencies are all under the thumb of one man: we do have independent agencies with an independent mandate.

canada spacing out second doses not only provides greater protection, but has allowed us to reach a greater percentage of our population with a first dose than almost anyone else in the g7, and provide a baseline of general immunity.

* those entering sports competitions, the military, and public washrooms should do so with their biological sex, not the sex they believe to be.
* doctors should not prescribe hormone suppression or other gender altering treatments to under 18. and teens looking to change their gender should require permission from their parents.
* against kathlynne wynne's sex education curriculum. i don't like the idea of normalizing homosexuality and transgenderism to young children. parents should be the ones to teach their children on these topics as they see fit.
* against the assisted dying law. this opens the door for potential malpractice (i.e., a doctor coerces a not fully functional patient to sign a waver for their medical suicide). we should focus on improving treatments instead. 

**progressive viewpoint:**

* gay marriage should continue to be allowed and gay couples should have the same rights and treatment as non-gay couples (adoptions rights for example).
* women have the right to decide if they want an abortion. the government should never have a say in this.
* transgender people deserve the same rights, treatment, and protections as non-transgender individuals.

the point of a steadily rising carbon price floor is to cut our cheapest, lowest-value emissions first, instead of singling out a particular industry (the oil patch) or a particular province (alberta) as a scapegoat. alberta's going to be the most affected, since oil production is responsible for a lot of emissions, but other provinces (which have a lot of drivers) will be cutting their low-value emissions as well.

&gt; if you think that further climate change will be prevented by meeting the paris climate accords

this isn't binary. step one is to get carbon pricing and regulations in place, so that individuals and businesses have the incentive to cut emissions. step two is to tighten them, cutting emissions faster. the advantage of the national carbon price floor is that it's flexible: initially it just went to $50/t in 2022, which as numerous modellers pointed out, wouldn't be enough. so now it's continuing to rise by $15/t each year until 2030, and if we need to cut faster, we can raise it faster.

the liberals actually present them as 4x higher, but the pbo highlighted that that is not an accurate reflection of actual government spending as there is a massive difference in lowering the interest rate of loans. those loans is basically money that developers could already access from the federal government through traditional cmhc insurance, the liberals just offer that same money at a lower interest rate and claim the full amount of the loan as government spending, even though the real difference is the interest amount, the rest gets paid back. for instance, rcfi which represents 71,000 promised units has an advertised budget of $26 billion, but only costs the government $1.6 billion in reality.

right, those \"real life circumstances\" was that the lpc still had a large number of very good politicians, policy wonks, back room dealers, fundraisers, still in the party and ready to go to work. which they did. they also had a young, handsome, charismatic, famous future leader waiting in the wings, so that helped too. 

if you're trying to say that jack layton's death is the reason the ndp didn't ascend and the lpc didn't die out then i think you're wrong. i don't think layton could have kept the momentum from the 2011 race in 2015. not with trudeau in the running. people underestimate just how unpopular and uncharistmatic iggy was. he was an awful party leader and the lpc paid the price in 2011.

i'm not saying we should be under house arrest, all i'm saying is don't try and run before we get walking. if we had just done shit properly in february of last year we wouldn't have 26,000 people dead because of this shit.

masks, essential travel only etc. until we can get to that 80-90% vaccination rate to bring the r number below 1 and not risk spreading to people who cannot get vaccinated.

i'm not scared of this shit, i've been working on construction sites this entire time, but i am cautious and follow precautions (mask, hand washingetc.). if not traveling can save a life that's a small price to pay.",liberals

even when canadian arctic scholars say otherwise.

[lackenbauer ](https://www.naadsn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dean-policy-brief_breaking-through_lackenbauer-chapter.pdf)


but i digress,

how about we discuss those six years shall we? 

the trudeau arctic policy framework was a list of bulletpoints and was announced only right before a new federal election. great prioritizing there.

did anyone follow the vice-adm. mark norman’s case and the government’s (failed) attempt to prosecute and silence his whistle-blowing?

i’m lgbt2sq+ and the blood ban still exists, and rather than try to end it or provide documentation so as to explain its current status, the government has decided to battle an lgbt2sq+ couple seeking to reverse this ban in court.

we were promised electoral reform and a switch to a pr federal voting system.

i don’t recall the last election being pr. do you?

the we scandals, treatment of jody wilson-raybould in the snc-lavalin affair also call into serious question whether the party is really serious about the is issues.

what of ministerial responsibility over the handling of sexual misconduct in the rcaf? 

did the liberals condemn the current treatment of uighur’s as genocide? they were quick enough to condemn a canadian scholar’s criticism of québec’s bill 21.",liberals

two things can be true at once, also i said that one was getting worse not that it is worse. i made a comment on the rate of change not the absolute value, or as you are pointing out the per capita value.

i’m pretty sure every small “l” liberal (and by extension every big l liberal) hates the chinese government. you can love the people, the culture and the place though and couch your hatred for a government. you said “ a disaster of a country and a terrible place“ which is **not** about the government, at least not explicitly and as such i pushed back.

i was not ignoring the fact that the worst islamophobic hatred (and out right genocide) is china, in fact i was literally acknowledging it as an example of why the cpcs position on this issue is such nonsense... unless of course you explain it with the understanding that the cpc is racist. 

finally, it’s not bias, i’m acknowledging that the 90s happened and the left wing dictatorships largely collapsed (cuba and venezuela now being notable exceptions). most dictatorships that exist today are conservative dictatorships.",liberals

sorry, i don't follow what you're saying. that's the point of the vaccine. or are you saying asymptomatic transmission? because the vaccine does diminish the probability of me getting sick. that's it's entire point.

&gt;if not traveling can save a life that's a small price to pay.

1: how much of a life exactly are you speaking about? because me going to the mall when i am vaccinated is not going to kill one person. it may kill .0001 of a person in expectation or something. but, we need to be honest about the actual expected lives we are talking about, and what the actual cost is. if your threshold is honestly zero, then yes, you should never leave your house, we should outlaw drinking, we should make the speed limit 5 miles per hour, etc. in all of those cases, we have decided that it is worth the 6 zeroes of lives killed for some other purpose.

2: that's all well and good that it's a small price for you to pay, but with all due respect, people have different objective functions and different priorities. i don't think that you can claim that because it's a small price for you, that it is a small price for everyone. someone deciding to wait until marriage to have sex may well say that it is a small price, but other people can also disagree. it's not that one side is wrong or right, it's that they have different preferences and different objective functions. the same is tru here.",liberals
