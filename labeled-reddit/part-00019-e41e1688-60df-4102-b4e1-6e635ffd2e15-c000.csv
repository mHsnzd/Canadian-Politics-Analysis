i can't really prove or disprove this, given how this is a \"she said, he said\" situation. if you're under the assumption that there isn't a genocide happening, then it would be a logical conclusion to believe that a lot of uyghurs enjoy living in china.

it doesn't say that \"the vast majority of them\" are violent terrorists, it says that there are violent terrorists, and that's the purpose of the re-education centers.

the east turkestan islamic movement (etim) is an actual terrorist organization that's active in xinjiang. it has been designated as a terrorist organization with ties to al-qaeda [by the us](https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123086.htm), [european union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex:32012r0034), and un security council’s [al-qaida sanctions committee](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list/summaries/entity/eastern-turkistan-islamic-movement). 

there are thousands of uighurs who are returning to xinjiang, radicalized after fighting for isis. the goal of the re-education centers is to deradicalize them.

&gt; why are you, as a canadian, defending what china is doing?

it's definitely true that quebec has the right to amend its own constitution. and it's definitely true that quebec is free to pass a law which declares - as bill 96 does - that quebecers form a nation, and that french is the official language of quebec and the common language of the quebec nation. that law can even purport to amend the *constitution act, 1867.* there's no mechanism for ottawa or the courts to stop such an action.

but that doesn't - or at least shouldn't - mean that the text of the ca 1867 actually gets updated if/when bill 96 receives royal assent. since its an amendment \"affecting the use of french or english within a province,\" the consent of the federal parliament, and a subsequent proclamation under the great seal issued by the governor general, should be required to actually change the \"supreme law of canada.\" [some experts](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/may-2021/quebecs-attempt-to-unilaterally-amend-the-canadian-constitution-wont-fly/) have even suggested that the \"quebecers form a nation\" declaration would represent such a significant change to the architecture of the constitution that it would likely trigger the need for a general amendment (using the 7/50 formula).

if that is the case, then passing bill 96 should either a) trigger a request from the quebec government to ottawa to pass a bill concurring with the ca 1867 amendments, or b) a refusal by ottawa to amend the ca 1867, leading to a court challenge *by quebec* (which quebec would be likely to lose).

it's hard to imagine justice canada is advising the minister of justice that the 1867 constitutional text can be updated unilaterally by a provincial legislature without reference to the federal parliament. and it's hard to imagine the pm would imply such a thing in the absence of such advice. so it's likely what he's really saying here is that ottawa can't and won't intervene in this case or challenge bill 96 - not that ottawa will accept the ca 1867 as having been amended if the bill passes. but i guess we'll see.

one way or another, this feels like it'll end in a courtroom.",liberals

the oecd has an agreed-upon level of 0.7% of gni. that was a target proposed and championed by canada and lester b. pearson. canada under harper dropped to 0.3%* in doing this, he specifically reduced aid to african countries. they eventually added back some of the excluded countries after criticism, but ended up freezing aid anyway in a bid to magically balance the budget. 

i agree that throwing money at the problem isn't a solution, but straight up cutting money from aid agencies isn't either. 

\\* it should be noted that under trudeau that has dropped even further to 0.26% (although the actual dollar amount has gone up). this is part of the reason trudeau was also unable to secure a seat at the security council.",liberals

(here's what i expect to happen in that time line.)

the federal government offers an electric vehicle rebate because they've been trying to promote their usage by making them cheaper. but now they're becoming cheaper via greater competition and advancements in batteries, and we will probably see a ramping down of the rebates of electric vehicles, followed by a grace period, followed by the introduction of a similar tax once the number of electric vehicles start to take a significant proportion of all vehicles sold and driven in canada. 

(here's why doing this tax now is obviously not great.)

the inconsistency of a province charging a surcharge for electric vehicle while the federal government offers a rebate just makes it seem they're trying to grab some of that cash while simultaneously giving a \"win\" to the people in the conservative party that voted to not admit that the environment is fucked up and we need to make changes.

(here's why a government should be interested in putting money towards environmentally beneficial policies.)

and it's also got to be said. there are real costs to our economy from pollution. they're not upfront but they are there. air quality causes millions of premature deaths every single year. the general costs of changing weather. the death of all sorts of important animals. there are even studies that seem to show that air pollution can cause depression. what's the reported cost of cleaning up the oil sands? hint, it's billions and billions of dollars.

(here's my conclusion).

we should want to make electric vehicles as cheap as is sensible in our transition to probably banning the sale of new gas vehicles in around 10 years or so. and when that happens we should probably have this tax, but to make it now when we need to make it easier to transition to electric makes no sense. imo it's clearly political and dumb.",conservatives

i suspect the answer may lie in what you say about the ndp’s weak presence in the region. she wanted out, but she wanted to keep her seat. not the noblest of moves, but understandable. and she says all sorts of laudable things about wanting a voice for her constituency, which i suppose if we’re being charitable shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.

layton had spent years quietly building the ndp in quebec. as much as we remember the fluke candidates in 2011, layton had been deliberately courting star candidates like mulcair, saganash and françoise boivin. and when the election call came, pretty much out of the gate he went on the defensive in rural québec. people said he was mad to waste time on lost causes when he could be campaigning in places where he had a better chance. but we see what happened.

there absolutely was a right-time-right-place aspect to layton's québec breakthrough in 2011, i'm not denying that. but it wasn't quite a fluke either. it was a deliberate and calculated risk that might not have paid off (see: broadbent, 1988) but happened to in this case.

how that would have carried on has more to do with what would have happened to the liberals and the bloc than anything else. the last poll i can find before justin trudeau threw his hat into the liberal ring was an environics from sep 27, 2012. it had the ndp leading nationally at 35 over the cpc at 31and the lpc at 20. they were 37 in québec over the bq at 33. and all of this is *without* layton at the helm. the bq were definitely gasping back to life, but the liberals *weren't*. and if you don't recall, the 2013 liberal leadership election pitted trudeau against... well, marc garneau was the biggest name. joyce murray, karen mccrimmon, david bertschi, deborak coyne, martin cauchon... none really names that you could see turning the party around. and, i've said this before but it bears repeating: if layton hadn't died, trudeau wouldn't have run in the first place. trudeau was a *very* reluctant leadership candidate and needed to be coaxed into it by liberal brass. against layton, he'd have said no. and layton would have performed just fine in 2015 against marc garneau.",liberals

it's impossible to stop people from consuming it though, alcohol is easier to produce than weed. i can make a great bum wine with welch's grape juice, cane sugar, nutrient and wine yeast. i also have a $2,000 brewing setup to make beer as well, but you can make bum beer with around $100 worth of equipment. we've been producing alcohol since before recorded history, cavemen could literally make it. it will just become another black market.

&gt; *\"the idea that you need to care deeply about what others want to talk about is a little bizarre.\"*

i am surprised to read this statement on a political subreddit literally dedicated to talking about what others want to talk about. i don't understand how you can hold this view and also have no opinion whether or not the media was 'right or wrong' to criticize someone's choice in socks.

&gt; *\"in any case, the cpc criticized jts socks because they were tying to paint him as all sizzle and no steak.\"*

sure, that's one way of looking at it. another perspective is that they knew that the media loves to focus on dumb shit like socks because it allows them to ignore in-depth analysis of actual, real policy. in the case of a media outlet like, oh, i dunno, let's say, uhhh, the national post - it provides a very convenient distractor from the cpc's lack of policymaking prowess.

i am indeed convinced that you care about what others want to talk about, and i think that's pretty cool. try to dissuade me if you want, but i will continue to read your comments with enthusiasm. :)

edit: just a thought, too - i did not mean to imply above that the media cannot focus on *both* dumb shit like socks and substantive policy, but just that it is often the case that one thing gets overlooked for another, and so on, dependent on the context",liberals

more importantly there are no concrete plans for a treatment resource nor any way to pay for except to once again raise taxes.

the problem with simple metrics is that they are simple and don't have any context. using the latest metrics from the [new york times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html), it looks like canada is currently 46th per vaccinations/100 people. however, if you take a look at some of the countries that are above us on the list, you can see that some of them are tiny. the seschyelles, monaco, barbados, iceland, estonia, liechtenstein, etc. liechtenstein alone is pretty funny because even though they haven't vaccinated 2000 people yet, they are still higher than us on a per-100 people basis. most of the countries that are ahead of us on a per-100 people basis - when not the us, uk or israel - are either much smaller than us population wise, in the eu (and therefore part of their vaccine purchasing program) or both.

if you start sorting us by total vaccines delivered, we are in 20th spot, with the us, uk, isreal and eu nations, along with heavy population countries like china, india, russia and brazil ahead of us (though the latter have lower per 100 people than we do). considering the scarcity of vaccines, and the fact that we're not producing our own at the moment, 20th in total vaccines delivered is not bad.",liberals

[this](https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2020/12/03/canadas-public-broadcaster-announces-new-cuts-to-radio-canada-international/) appears to be the announcement the article refers to, which does not say anything about “switch\\[ing\\] rci’s focus on reaching external audiences…to serving unofficial language minorities within canada,” but rather, says it will “reach new audiences at home and abroad,” while also adding two new language services – punjabi and tagalog. how is that “a stunning in-your-face to the broadcasting act”? how is it not, “providing an international service” under s. 46(2) of the act? the author himself acknowledges that an internet-based service counts, so where is the non-compliance?

and i’m not even sure how you distinguish between “external” and “internal” audiences in the digital age. if rci writes an article in tagalog about the latest outrage from rodrigo duterte and puts it on the web, is that for filipinos in the philippines to get a canadian point of view on it, or filipinos in canada to access news from where they come from? why can’t it be both? and if you’re committed to separating the two, then what’s the solution—start geo-blocking cbc content?

if people want rci to do more, however—and there’s certainly any number of arguments that they should—then cbc needs more funding. cbc/radio-canada is [one of the most poorly funded public broadcasters in the developed world](https://site-cbc.radio-canada.ca/documents/vision/strategy/latest-studies/nordicity-public-broadcaster-comparison-2016.pdf) (see in particular fig. 2, pg. 9) and the liberals’ 2015 “infusion of cash” was peanuts compared to the costs and challenges of (public) broadcasting. 

also, peter menzies was a stephen harper appointee to the crtc who has long been in ideological conformity with that part of the political spectrum, and who has since trafficked in articles with headlines like “[the cbc sucks](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/cbc-sucks/)” and “[is it time for the cbc to call it a day?](https://theline.substack.com/p/peter-menzies-is-it-time-for-the)”. you’ll have to forgive me if i struggle with the notion that menzies’ primary interest is passionate support for rci.",liberals

first impressions:

&gt;summary  
&gt;  
&gt;this enactment amends the *criminal code* to, among other things,**(a)** increase, from 10 to 14 years, the maximum penalty of imprisonment for indictable weapons offences in sections 95, 96, 99, 100 and 103;

meaning that those offences will once again qualify for a preliminary inquiry. note this does not include unauthorized possession (s. 91 and 92) but does include possession of a restricted/prohibited firearm with ammunition (s. 95(1)).

&gt;**(d)** create a new offence for altering a cartridge magazine to exceed its lawful capacity;

okay, although it was already an offence to *possess* such a magazine (it's a 'prohibited device').

&gt;**(d)** require that the holders of a licence authorizing the possession of a handgun comply with the requirements and prohibitions relating to the storage and transporting of handguns within a municipality in which a by-law establishing those requirements and prohibitions is in force if the minister of public safety and emergency preparedness is notified of the by-law in the prescribed manner, and provide for exceptions to that requirement;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(e)** require that the commissioner of firearms maintain a publicly available list of the municipalities in which such requirements and prohibitions apply;  
&gt;  
&gt;**(f)** authorize a chief firearms officer to suspend a licence if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that the licence holder is no longer eligible for it;

there's your municipal ban. to be clear, i think this is a bad idea, but it's not at all evident that it's unconstitutional. the supreme court's reference opinion in *reference re firearms act* was that the *firearms act* was a valid exercise of the criminal law power, **not** that parliament has plenary power over everything related to firearms. parliament **does not** have plenary power over 'everything related to firearms'. municipalities and provinces regulate the discharge of firearms and of hunting, and i don't think there's any serious question about their power to do so. \"property and civil rights in the province\" is a provincial head of power under the *constitution act 1867* (and is the legal basis for quebec's long gun registry).

nor is there anything unusual or improper about a criminal law that may be altered in its scope or application by provincial law (theft and other offences related to property being an obvious example).",liberals

## where do illegal guns come from?

bottom line: no one knows. if someone tells you they do, they are lying.   
the canadian government does not collect statistics on the origin of crime guns. in 2018, the rcmp stated straightforwardly to the cbc:  


* *“currently, there is no national repository for this type of information in canada. the canadian firearms program does not collect or track national statistics with regard to the origin of crime guns,\" said sgt. marie damian.*

the [cbc](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/gun-crime-statistics-1.4779702) and [globe and mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-how-the-globe-tried-and-failed-to-find-the-source-of-canadas/) have good articles explaining the lack of high-quality statistics.  
but what do we know?  


* the police/public service had about 800 guns lost or stolen between 2005 and 2019  [\\[source\\]](https://dennisryoung.ca/2019/07/04/rcmp-813-guns-lost-by-and-stolen-from-police-and-public-agencies-2005-2019/)
* some guns can be illegally manufactured [\\[source\\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/national-gun-trafficking-straw-buying-smuggling-firearms-1.5126228)
* guns are straw-purchased (someone buys the gun legally, and sells it on the black market) [\\[source\\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/national-gun-trafficking-straw-buying-smuggling-firearms-1.5126228)
* there are around 1,000 break-and-enters to steal guns reported each year [\\[source\\]](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-005-x/2018001/article/54980-eng.htm)
* toronto police claimed that about half of crime guns they traced were of domestic origin in 2017 [\\[source\\]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/guns-domestic-danforth-shooting-toronto-1.4759159)
* from 2007 to 2017, the toronto police seized 3,710 guns. [1,923](https://i.imgur.com/jbmaijx.png) were traced to the us and [1,787](https://i.imgur.com/4vd1stl.png) were domestic. 52% and 48%, respectively.
* rcmp estimates range from [20% to 50% domestically sourced](https://i.imgur.com/0ovpvfi.png), depending on province [\\[source\\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-how-the-globe-tried-and-failed-to-find-the-source-of-canadas/)
* the united states is the primary source for illegal foreign guns
* in 2007, ontario’s firearms tracing and enforcement program (fate) traced 705 crime guns, of which 90% were prohibited or restricted. in this sample, 69% were traced to the us [\\[source\\]](https://cjr.ufv.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/a-literature-review-on-illegal-firearms.pdf)
* a 2013 annual report by the firearms investigative and enforcement services directorate (fiesd) concluded that of the 1,379 crime guns recovered in the western region of canada, 46% were smuggled [\\[source\\]](https://cjr.ufv.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/a-literature-review-on-illegal-firearms.pdf)
* another study examined 1,929 guns seized by the police in quebec between 2010 and 2011. of the 1,595 firearms where information about the origin was available, 84% were from the united states and 16.7% were sourced from canada [\\[source\\]](https://cjr.ufv.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/a-literature-review-on-illegal-firearms.pdf)
* of 327 crime-related handguns recovered by toronto police in 2006, 36.7%were traced to the united states [\\[source\\]](https://cjr.ufv.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/a-literature-review-on-illegal-firearms.pdf)
* in 2020, peel police (mississauga + brampton) said 91% of illegal guns seized that year came from the us. 74% the prior year. actual number unclear, but comments suggest 34 guns sized in one operation made up the majority [\\[source\\]](https://www.insauga.com/almost-all-illegal-guns-coming-into-mississauga-and-brampton-are-from-the-us)

overall, we can’t say exactly where illegal weapons are coming from right now. it is clear that many guns are sold legally in canada and make their way to the black market. it’s also clear that a large number of illegal weapons are smuggled from the united states. illegal manufacturing does occur, but appears to be relatively uncommon.",liberals

&gt; some details of the fipa will illustrate my point that the government has been behaving like a salesperson who gets lots of orders by selling at a loss. for example:

&gt;1. the harper government gave chinese investors “market access” to canada — meaning a right to buy what they want in our economy — without getting the same for canadian investors in china.
&gt;2. when he announced the fipa, harper said that a fipa “ensures non-discriminatory treatment” for foreign investors. but the actual terms of the fipa (article 8(2)(a), to be exact) let china keep all its existing laws, policies, or practices that discriminate against canadian investors.

to be centre-right ideologically, you need to be like merkel's party or the french republican party which is a moderate conservative party, so no i don't see the party becoming ever in that position.

i would like them to do that.

i ran as a progressive canadian party candidate in 2011, so my take is the party can never embrace collectivist conservatism which backs a welfare state.

that is what a pc party would be about.

canada went from the federal pc's who were leaders on social &amp; climate policy, to them being replaced by the cpc's who significantly regressed on both fronts a little over a decade after the fact.

the first part is mandatory minnuam parking space requirements those force house and condo builders to put in a number of parking spaces per unit. given most new parking spaces are underground the cost effect should be similar at about 20% of total cost. so for the the parking requirements i feel confident that have a significant impact on prices. in toronto parking spaces tend to go from 30 to 80 thousand a year being on the higher end in downtown according to one real easte firm.

the second part is suburban zoning the only canada specific study came from the fraser institute .while they are considered reliable they do have a libertarian friendly editorial board for peer review on there study. so given the fact this issue has not be studied at length but  the evidence seems to point it being a large burden on housing prices but has not been studied enough to say for absolute certainty  .
they also only looked at the effect on housing supply nothing else a very narrow scope.

and as you and i have both seen, homeowners in vancouver will mobilize and have a lot of wealth to use. 

i think that it would be impossible to create these changes politically and perhaps even practically with vancouver being inept at all areas of government. the ndp would create these changes and city council would still find ways to slow, delay and overall fight them.

unless you're in somalia and have to trade some goats with your local warlord for a plot of land, housing is regulated everywhere.  there's no such thing as an unregulated housing market, and no such thing as a free market in housing as the government is required to build basic infrastructure to make an area livable, something the free market is not able to do.

i'm all for putting parking space to better use and making it generally easier to build condos, but the idea that parking spots are some kind of general panacea considering that housing in major cities like toronto has turned into a global commodity that investors buy up like they do a piece of stock, is extremely naive and myopic.

if you don't address the fact that you have global capital and cheap credit flowing into a finite amount of land, you can't address the problem. 

there was a study from i believe ryerson showing that the issue with canada isn't that we're not building enough homes - we are.  

the fraser institute is a right-wing think tank funded by the koch foundation and canada's billionaire class.  i take what they say with a grain of salt.  they've had an axe to grind with the green belt for some time, as have ford's developer buddies, and they would love nothing more than to pave it over and build a bunch of tract homes.  this won't really solve the housing crisis if these homes are then scooped up by the dozen by investors and people who can leverage their existing equity to purchase second homes.",conservatives
