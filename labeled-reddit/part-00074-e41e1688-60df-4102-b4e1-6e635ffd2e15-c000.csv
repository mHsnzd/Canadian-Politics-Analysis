yes it does, implement a federal property tax. it's fully constitutional and pricing would drop tomorrow. but that would anger homeowners, the horror!

here's the math if you tripled property tax you could lower income tax 64% and housing would drop 40%.

[according to the oecd](https://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-canada.pdf) total income tax on canada was 267b. property tax was 85b. if you triple the property tax you s generate 170b. therefore you can cut income taxes 64% (my bad) with the new revenue.

the property tax rate in toronto is 0.59%. the average home in toronto is 1.1m. so 3x the property tax works out to the person paying \\~13k a year more. that works out to 1,083 a month. at 2% interest and 25 year amortization that works out to 3,700 a month in mortgage for the average home. if instead you have to allocate that 1,083 to property tax you can now afford a mortgage of 2,617. that payment can purchase a home worth 650,000. so tripling property tax would lower prices by 41%.",liberals

i mean, big-tent parties arguably *are* coalitions. the conservatives united a bunch of different factions from red tories to libertarians to socons. my only problem with actually coalitions is that there is much more gridlock and they are more volatile; isreal had four elections in the last two years. i also don't like the idea of fringe parties becoming so prominent if we're being honest.

my other issue that i didn't mention is that canada is such a vast country and i would like to have a local representative who is accountable to me and whom i can call. there is also local issues that only they would know about too. i know that this is supposedly fixed with mmpr though.

&gt;canadians might also have a change of heart on their politics if they actually got what they wish for. the best cure for support of the ndp would likely be an ndp government.

no thanks; i'd like to avoid complete economic destruction. it would be hard to scale back the government policies (such as minimum wage increases) which are present on singh's retardedly insane platform. once you give a toddler candy, they are going to cry and scream when you take it away. 

look at the trouble ford was having before the pandemic trying to reverse a bunch liberal policies that were disastrous for ontario. nothing has really changed since he's taken office; they have more just stopped rather than reversed course.

furthermore every liberal announcement like this suffers from the same undermining theme: if you care about this, why not have just done this instead of calling an election.

trudeau had a very strong minority, and an ndp which would have supported these policies and brought them up to majority numbers on any vote. trudeau had two more years to easily implement any of these very ndp friendly policies, so if they're that important why are we back at the polls instead of getting on with it.

h11l1xn,2021-06-08T02:15:04.000-07:00,"‘this is a terrorist attack’: trudeau condemns tragedy in london, ont. that left 4 dead a few things here:

the fact that you cite *multiple* definitions kind of works against the idea of it having a fixed meaning.

since we're in canada, lets look at (a portion of) that definition:

&gt;(a) in whole or in part for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause, and

&gt;(b) in whole or in part with the intention of intimidating the public, or a segment of the public, with regard to its security, including its economic security, or compelling a person, a government or a domestic or an international organization to do or to refrain from doing any act, whether the public or the person, government or organization is inside or outside canada, and

i'd argue that \"ideological purpose\" and \"intimidating a segment of the public\" make this definition so fuzzy and broad that you could characterize a whole lot of acts as terrorism if you were so inclined. we don't actually see it so broadly applied because there's a whole lot of discretion involved in how it gets applied. basically, those with the power to make use of the term can do so when they see fit.

beyond that, that's strictly a legal definition. it only constrains the meaning of the word within the context of criminal prosecution. the vast majority of the time the word \"terrorism\" is used, it's not used in such a context, so this official definition does not fix the meaning of the term.",liberals

the old white guys don't want to give up the power they've unjustly acquired. the young white guys are afraid they'll never amount to anything in a world where the deck isn't stacked in their favour, and rather than accept that most of us never matter that much, they lash out with violence and demands to take the country back. the white women and other minorities who buy into it give up their shot at a more equitable world in exchange for proximity to a waning power. all of this shit is falling to pieces now that it's easier than ever for people to document and share what's happening to them - the examples of police brutality or karens calling the cops on people for existing while black are too many to name. people still try to gaslight but it's hard to do when there's 4k video evidence.

while it some limited cases it is true, the critics of bill 96 are almost always the same as the old critics of bill 101, using the same hyperbolic language that is francophones hear all the time. 

if you read and listened to media today, almost everybody, federalists alike, were saying it was a bad take.

i feel the anglo sphere heavily underestimate how some criticisms are so constant that they become tied to the traditional francophobia that was and is still present in our lives. most of my group of friends is federalist, and it sounded bad to all of us. we knew the bq would make gains just with that, and the fact nobody else was reacting to it. 

calling a tough question on bill 21 was just fair. if this was the only thing, i’d say you were right.

for example a physical fitness test is acceptable in police forces because catching and subduing dangerous criminals is a key job responsibility. an accounting firm cannot have any physical fitness test as it does not impact the job and would likely discrimate against women and disabled people.

awfully nice of paul to throw her entire quebec green team under the bus for suggesting that quebec is just full of xenophobes! all she cares about is her own riding, toronto center, which laps this kind of crap up, that much is clear. greens should have tried to remove her sooner.

the green party is searching for relevancy right now. they aren't all left-of-center voters, just voters who value the environment as their #1 issue. now that other parties have adopted environmentalism, they appear headed towards social justice issues as a way to differentiate themselves from the liberals and ndp. why else would they have a huge blowup over israelis vs palestinians? if they do that, they are just another ndp, and the ndp base isn't big enough for the two of them.

a constitutional crisis happens when one of a set number of things happens:

1. someone violates or proposes to violate the constitution and it is unclear what to do about it. this can be for malicious or for meritorious reasons - for example, proposals of unilateral separation during the separatist referendum of 1995 posed this kind of problem. 

2. the government and courts are unable to agree who has constitutional authority to perform a certain function or the way it should be performed. the king-byng controversy was this kind of crisis. 

3. someone violates the constitution or attempts to destroy the constitution and attempts to prevent their actions or hold them to account fail. military coups are this kind of crisis. 

legault campaigning for or against a leader of a federal party is neither unprecedented or a crisis. danny williams of newfoundland campaigned against harper. justin trudeau campaigned for numerous provincial liberals back when he was popular and such associations helped. this kind of campaigning across jurisdictional lines is common, benign and certainly not a constitutional crisis.",liberals

it's especially frustrating because anyone who knows anything about anything knows that the oic is unbelievably stupid, that is the reality of the situation. it would have been really nice for a politician in canada to introduce that reality on a large scale public forum, but i understand why he didn't.

even dipping your toe into the rhetoric required to make a defensible position on gun control or anti-oic arguments is unfit for the debate, it would really only function correctly in the house or some other kind of long form discussion where he actually has time to reason. basically he was left with either dodging the question over and over again and attempting to shift attention back to the liberals, or dropping the subject entirely, and i don't think he made the worst decision.",liberals

this was in bc, and it was in 2017, so there'd been almost 20 years of uninterrupted dominance by the bc liberals (which are a merger of the federal liberal and conservative parties). and during that election, the bc ndp was basically enraged, and were on a warpath to win at all costs. the toxicity and hostility that i (and other candidates) experienced from bc ndp supporters surprised the hell out of us.  


basically they had a narrative going where if they didn't manage to win the election they were going to blame the greens for \"spoiling it\" for them. and so they had a lot of supporters who'd been whipped into a real frenzy and were targeting anyone who wasn't falling into line to vote for the bc ndp.

the point of the law could be characterized as an attempt to make canadians safer, sure, if we're speaking extremely broadly. however, that's certainly not an adequate level of specificity for measuring the success of the law at all, especially if we're going to do this only about 18 months after it's announcement. the standard pro-gun claim has been that most illegally obtained weapons come from the us, in an attempt to portray the law as ineffective over the issue of illegally obtained guns as a whole. but, since a law against domestic sale and ownership of these weapons cannot naturally address the cross-border source, it's not reasonable to claim the law is meant to address all illegally obtained guns of the brands and varieties it specifically prohibits. therefore it's not fair to say the point of the law was to \"make canadians safer\", and this is precisely what i mean when i ask how can it be labeled good or bad when consensus on the intent can't even be reached. even if the point were to, say, \"lower overall gun violence\", simply stating that gun violence going up since its implementation means it has been ineffective is not a strong argument in the slightest. how could that conclusion be drawn when the level of gun violence *without* the law is unknown? you have the pandemic, economic instability in many demographics, drug scarcity due to the border closure, and any number of other variables driving that level of gun violence. calling the law ineffective is fine, if you have credible support for that argument, but this has not been provided yet.",liberals

what do i say to this? 

look at your candidates running for mp, yes the party leader is important. but who speaks for you when you vote? who do you vote for? you vote for your mp.

there's a long history of the liberals being the \"elitists\" and i rarely hear it being described as a \"working class party\". that long remains the broader trend and any narrative that is so flippantly dismissive that it relies on \"woke\" as a characterization is already not one to be taken seriously.

but for some reason you reacted like it was ridiculous to invoke how anglophone culture is generally perceived in comparison to francophone culture. going back to the original point about education and elitism, which nationalist political culture do you think is more commonly associated with \"elite\" higher education: quebec, which supports the arts and humanities? or alberta with conservative leaders hostile to the \"woke university crowd\" that unserious people like to invoke?

&gt; past that, **that you'd characterise bill 21 as an anti-hijab bill**....

do you think bill 21 is *not* anti-hijab in any way? are you going to suggest bill 21 is pro-hijab or something?

sure it bans more than just the hijab the same way that donald trump explicitly campaigned on a \"muslim ban\" and then legally defended it in court as supposedly not discriminatory because they added north korea to the list of banned countries.

&gt; .... is a pretty clear indication **you're** totally incapable of imagining **there are people who have** other cultural backgrounds than **their own**.

i assume you mean besides my own background? otherwise i'm having trouble parsing that sentence grammatically. i also feel that the law is exclusionary towards sikhs as well as muslims so i'm not sure which culture you seem to be suggesting i'm 'incapable' of seeing past. 



&gt; it's not just that france isn't quebec, it's that france is functionally a totally different context here.

i totally agree. now, getting back to the point: why does that specifically mean my conclusion is wrong? to be clear, i never argued that \"france is the same context as quebec\" nor that \"france is quebec\".

astrazeneca was tested later in the year in the uk, south africa and brazil and likely had to tangle with the variants we are now seeing in canada. that resulted in a lower efficacy number and i have not yet seen hard efficacy numbers from pfizer and moderna on the variants, only that they are less effective.

gz2c59f,2021-05-22T01:40:16.000-07:00,"justin trudeau says he has advice that backs quebec’s plan to change the constitution. people, please go take a look at the [canadian constitution](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/)...

you will notice that:

* quebec has an extensive presence inside the 1867 constitution articles 71 to 87, 90, 98,112,113, 124 to 144,
* that article 4.88 says that the legislature of new brunswick and nova scotia continue to exist (as before 1867), meaning their constitution is not included in the canadian constitution.
* that other provinces are only briefly mentioned only to line up their constitution with that of canada's.

**the conclusion is that the entire provincial constitution of quebec (and ontario's) is enshrined into the canadian constitution...**

so if quebec wants to amend anything that concerns only the province, the inner workings of the government of quebec, **it has no choice but to amend the articles that concern quebec in the canadian constitution.**

**for example**

* quebec want to amend the rules of the speaker of the legislature of quebec, it has to amend article 77 of the canadian constitution.
* quebec wants to amend the duration of a government from 4 to 5, it has to amend article 85 of the canadian constitution... and so does ontario.

**all the other provinces can amend those things on their own without touching the canadian constitution...**",liberals

i'd rather a teacher not take a leave of absence because childcare costs so much for them that it's cheaper for a teacher to be a stay at home parent than work all day.

apparently taxing the rich is bad but screwing over the middle class is more acceptable.

there used to be thousands of \"retirees\" who kept themselves on the substitute roles so they could make some extra cash. and given the policy above, the principles were basically stuck being forced to always call them in first. this has created a massive gap where new teachers aren't getting called in, not getting experiences, and therefor when full time jobs are needed, are getting overlooked.

my friend unfortunately never ended up being a teacher. after 12 years, he moved back into his mother's apartment (who is in declining health). and sadly due to everything, he ended up having becoming bipolar, snapping and ended up homeless. i had to have him live on my  couch for months while i tried to help him, eventually having to take him to the hospital. i don't know where he is anymore :(",conservatives

i know in alberta the daycare costs sit around $1200-$1300/month, but sits higher in calgary.

i think the costs are typically higher in alberta and ontario due to conservative policies that have focused more on rebates than subsidy (in order to shovel more money to private operators). it ultimately reduces the number of available spots (compared to subsidy) and drives prices up.

so after waiting years for this, your solution is that natives should have to wait another few years and the solution is voting in a parties that continually ignore and discriminate against them? you just completely dismissed the fact that they are refusing to provide medical services that other canadians are able to receive because they don't want to pay for natives to receive the same level of care. but it good that people are finally acknowledging that this injustice will never change with the liberals in power.

you also avoid the fact that the federal government is trying to say they are in agreement with this decision while they are fighting it in the courts. while they are fighting this ruling in the courts they [have a web page](https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1568396042341/1568396159824) trying to tell canadians how go this ruling was and how they support it. they are just making false statements at this point and canadians are buying. not really a surprise with this government, they are also fighting residential school survivors in court and trying to destroy evidence in it, but seeing other canadians being perfectly fine with the mistreatment of minorities by the government is something i will never get used to.",liberals

the many, many condos sold to foreign nationals &amp; immediately rented *are* investments, and maybe we need a better way to funnel those 1-off unit investments into more purpose-built rental, since if it's going to be rental stock anyway we benefit a lot more from it being long term reliable rental stock.

&gt;however, there are several policies that have been proven to have helped the less fortunate canadians. cerb is the biggest example. had it not been for this help, we would have significantly more homeless and people living in poverty as they were unable to work due to covid restrictions (which were necessary to help save lives).   
  
&gt;  
&gt;stats canada reported that 4,238,000  people in 2015 were living under the poverty line. thanks to the policies implemented, that changed to 3,412,000 in 2017. that is approx 826k less people living in poverty. approx 280k of those being children. a key factor in this was simplifying the ccb into one system instead of 3 systems that left tax filers confused.

&gt;  
&gt;lockdown restrictions were set by the provinces. the federal govt laid out their recommendations. it was mostly the conservative sun provinces that decided to ignore or come up with their own plans.   
&gt;  
&gt;you are confusing your timelines. in 2017, trudeau called trump's border lockdowns racist because they were targeting muslim countries. the closest thing i can find of your claim is from may 2020. trudeau extended the border closure (which started around mar 2020). in the same conference he was asked about the murder of george floyd and commented something along the lines that is appeared racially motivated.
