trudeau also directly violated his own words six years ago, when he said with exactly 0 qualifiers that 2015 would be the last election held under first past the post. he had 0 other parties to satisfy and 0 members of his own caucus with the power to say no to him.

trudeau in polls has a very similar number of people who would vote for him in this election. if he did get say 37% of the people to vote for him up from 33%, he should benefit from that by getting about 37% of the seats, but he should not be able to benefit such that he gets a majority that protects him so strongly from scrutiny and the need to cooperate. the way the votes are distributed within each riding has a blatantly and grossly disproportionate influence on who wins an election and you damn well know that fact.",liberals

one could argue that there is enough jurisprudence now and that this program should end. on the otherhand, a government issuing a blanket suspension of charter rights so they can  discriminate against religious, ethnic, and racialized minorities is unprecedented in canada, so there is good reason to argue that federal funding should apply here.

i imagine the supporters have never worked with someone in a turban. or never been to a muslim friend's house for dinner. that's not to say they're racist. just that they're not experienced in how these faiths are practiced and their assumptions aren't realistic. refusal to remove a hijab is not fundamentalism. i wouldn't take off my wedding ring if they law demanded it.

out west, to provide an example, many sikhs are drawn to military or law enforcement jobs. there's never any concern that their private beliefs have an outward effect. so to the extent quebecois either believe that they'd be biased or fear that a cop in a turban sends the wrong message, those beliefs aren't founded in reality. i think it has to be coming from a place of either ignorance or cynicism.

i agree that religions shouldn't get special treatment by government. but if anything, i see bill 21 as privileging christians. it's not treating groups equally to pass a law that only impacts certain faiths. so opposing that law isn't demanding special treatment.

this wasn't really an issue for trudeau post chretien/martin, because i believe most of his cabinet and lots (but not all obv) of his mps were not in their govt. it could be an issue for the next leader though if they keep most of his people, in that they will still be viewed as trudeau's govt. it'll be interesting to see how (or if) they try to rebrand from that.",liberals

&gt;canada’s carbon tax is ineffective because prime minister justin trudeau cannot stop his ‘corporate socialism.’ 

canada's carbon tax is ineffective because it's set at too low a level. 

&gt;this makes it particularly difficult for low-income individuals who can barely afford the necessities as is and are now paying a carbon tax when in reality, businesses should be the ones footing the bill for our carbon emissions, not regular people. 

in every canadian jurisdiction, the cost of the carbon pricing is rebated back to low income individuals (and in many cases they get more back than they paid in). 

you can also make business foot 100% of the bill which would harm folks with low incomes even more as the price of goods would increase, while nothing would be rebated. 

&gt;in every decision he makes, we see justin trudeau – a man who has never once felt financial hardships – dismiss the needs of working-class people who are the ones keeping society running. 

we've never had a level of social supports like we do now. the total cost of cerb alone is going to be $77b which is unprecedented. nothing comes close. 

&gt;young adults, overwhelmingly, have been the group most likely to be laid off, working part-time and gig work with no access to benefits once graduating university. 

young adults have access to repayment assistance plans which are significantly more generous than private sector loans (at wicked interest rate for an unsecured loan). 

hit the nail on the head on this one though! 

&gt;one example is air canada who laid 20,000 people off in march while receiving $400 million in wage subsidy. air canada then went on to buy air transat and pay out big dividends to its shareholders. not to mention that they owe millions in refunds to customers and are holding the canadian government hostage by saying they won’t pay anyone back unless they get more bailout money. ",liberals

1. nearly everyone in the us is a republican (small r) which naturally includes conservatives. i think you would have to look really hard to find someone to the south that thinks a monarchy is superior form of gov't to a republic. contrast that to canada where the monarchy, or at least the current monarch, enjoy high levels of approval among all canadians and i suspect even higher levels of support among conservatives.

2. i am uncertain to the roots of us conservatism but i know that canadian conservatism is rooted in the british toryism. even to this day, the conservative party of canada is commonly referred to as the tories and the differences between the canadian and british conservative parties are rather small. in recent years there has been some influence from south of the border but i think that is a fairly recent phenomenon and hasn't completely changed the canadian conservative movement.",conservatives

no, it isn't? gdp per capita has been increasing since 1960, poverty by any measure has been going down for decades, unemployment is at a record low, etc.

in 1990, the lowest 20% of income earners earned an average income of just $6,000 in wages and salaries.

by 2009 87% of those in the bottom income group moved to a higher group. 

the individuals that began the 19-year period in the bottom 20% started with an average income of $6,000 but by the end of the period their incomes had increased to an average $44,100.

from 2016 to 2018, nominal wages went up 5.7% and real wages went up 0.37% - not a massive increase, but still going *up* relative to inflation and purchasing power.

on average, wages of canadian full-time workers grew faster
during the 2000s than during the previous two decades.

we're doing just fine, and it seems your only complaint is that wages haven't increased as much as you'd like them to.

&gt; further, cost of living change is not one to one with inflation, and is actually higher. 

poverty, even when measured against market basket measures or the cost of living, has decreased over time.

other than housing, and education, things are cheaper today, not more expensive.

the irony to me is that this artificial preservation of french belies the exact reason that english is a more global language which is it's *versatility*. it is not because english is so widespread that we don't feel threatened, it's a global language because it is a constantly evolving adaptable composite of many languages. from it's germanic roots, to the infusion of latin, greek, french and more. if i'm not mistaken french root words in english make up about *thirty percent* of the language! if the reverse was true this would be seen as a degradation of french. and then how many words are constantly becoming added due to colloquial use and pure invention of writers like spenser, shakespeare and carroll? english is constantly being \"invaded\", reinvented etc. 

i don't intend any disrespect here, i discovered the discontent from my efforts to learn french during the quarantine. the french *should* be proud of their beautiful language, it has produced some of the greatest literature on the planet. *but* to me efforts like this are a little sisyphean and do more harm than good in protecting it.

created, to recoup the amount spent, while the rest goes toward keeping the  
economy low cost. this taxation is the mechanism for preventing inflation.

on by the big 5. i am quite confident they are the ones that really run the boc and have convinced politicians in this country that they need to let \"experts\" control monetary policy and very little to none of their lending contributes to increasing the productivity of our economy, or generating additional capital and assets. this is actually historical fact and goes back to when scotiabank lobbyists met with trudeau senior's government in the late 1970's, and used a jesuit priest to convince them that it was wrong to let politicians control monetary policy because they are inherently corrupt and it is the road to fascism. yet its the banks that simply inflate the value of existing capital and assets and make life more expensive for everyone.  
so if the rates go up and everyone they've lent money to does not have the  
means to pay back the loans given because the loans were used to inflate the cost  
of real estate and did not generate any new value, who goes under? the banks.  
you're right that government spending can cause inflation,  
but not if it is restricted to domestic productive spending, or spending that  
lowers the cost of doing business.",liberals

&gt;“this is a party that’s basically trying to rerun the 2015 campaign over and over again with [a worse] result each time,” said the senior liberal.

&gt;“those [losing popular vote] are signs of usually malaise. it’s still nice to do better than you did last time. [it’s important to] be able to say, ‘hey, our leadership and our policies actually helped us win this campaign.’”

&gt;another former senior liberal said that when they think about mr. trudeau’s unforced errors, they think “some people just never get it.” a third said that it appears mr. trudeau doesn’t care about these mistakes and just does what he wants to do.

&gt;“actions speak louder than words,” the source said. “by looking at his actions, do you think he cares? i don’t think he does.”

these are the opinions of current or former senior liberals in the party. we basically have articles depicting the person people expect to lead next in a good light at the same time that liberal sources are running to the media to trash the current leader.  could this be a sign that there is a desire, within the party or the party's base, to push trudeau out?

the majority are drug and/or alcohol-related (e.g., breach of the controlled drugs and substances act, breach of the narcotic control act, driving while ability impaired, driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in 100 ml of blood), a few thousand related to failures to appear or comply with court orders, and another couple thousand petty theft charges.

i think that blaming outsiders became a sort of defensive reaction, but i think the real truth isn't that the c-listers and small twitter accounts from the article beat albertan oil, but that market volatility did. think about it - are oil companies more likely to capitulate to environmental pressure, or justin trudeau? because the latter nationalized and guaranteed the most controversial project in the history of canadian oil.

we live in a partisan age and it's commonplace for politicians to just blame the other side, but in this case, i really don't believe that this was the result of political influence. for all that the environmental movement talks about wanting to close the tar sands that's never actually made it into any government policy. it was ideation at best, and a poor scapegoat for the reality of the market.",liberals
