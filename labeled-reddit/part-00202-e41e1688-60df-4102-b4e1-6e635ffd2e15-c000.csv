hkaxhtk,2021-11-11T14:17:52.000-08:00,"trudeau's description of lytton, b.c. during climate summit draws ire of local residents | cbc news &gt;forest wild fires have exactly two causes. only two . lightning and humans .  


actually, that's not quite correct.

in specific but kind of rare circumstances, it is possible to have conditions warm enough to create a smolder among leaves and debris if it piles up enough to capture and retain enough heat. it's rare, but possible. this can happen without any human interaction, and in all frankness, can happen more often due to lack of human interaction if anything. (we like to change things, so some of us might muss up that pile of leaves for instance.)

i've only ever seen anything like it happen once, and it was some silage at an old family farm that had been left too long and in too hot of sun. when we opened up the bags, it was lightly smoking from the inside, and parts were basically charcoal. in this case we had human activity creating perfect conditions for it, to be fair. but these conditions can create themselves with some time and luck.

i suggest reading this link for better info on the matter. [https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.0901124](https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.0901124)",liberals

h4kcodb,2021-07-08T16:38:23.000-07:00,"jagmeet singh commits ndp to building 500,000 affordable housing units - cowichan valley citizen i'm sorry to say that the federal liberals deserve a failing grade on housing. the federal government has enormous power in the housing market, primarily through its tax and financial regulation policies. in these areas, the federal liberals have only made things worse, introducing yet additional homebuying subsidies and refusing to consider taxing houses like normal assets. there is little need to speculate as to why this might be, adam vaughn and trudeau himself have often said that they will not pursue policies that reduce people's home equity. how they plan to improve housing affordability without lowering home prices is an exercise left to the reader.

indeed, one way to square this circle might be a major expansion of the non-market housing sector.  unfortunately, despite creating some positive programs, they remain an order-of-magnitude too small. the liberals like to tout their \"$40b housing strategy\", but this vastly overstates the actual spending by including loans and provincial dollars. a pbo [analysis](https://i.imgur.com/pgwnzq5.png) [shows](https://i.imgur.com/oxbotky.png) [that](https://i.imgur.com/rxggkse.png) the liberals have presided over only a modest increase in annual federal spending on housing affordability, even as the affordability of the housing market has massively deteriorated. the reality is that federal housing spending remains completely dominated by subsidies to homebuyers and owners, while spending on affordable housing remains marginal.

the ndp's proposal is not terribly different than the liberals' in its methods. but it is different in *scale*. they propose to increase the size of the liberals' affordable housing programs by at least a factor of *five*. this would amount to increasing canadian housing starts by around 20%, making non-market housing a substantial proportion of the canadian housing sector (roughly in line with european levels).

this alone will not be enough to solve the housing crisis. as i mentioned, the federal government's most powerful levers are actually the tax and financial ones. we not only need to put more resources into building affordable homes, we need to stop subsidizing and propping up the assets of existing owners. furthermore, the federal government needs to use its fiscal muscle to push back on poor urban planning rules that dominate canadian cities.

sadly, the liberals are not doing these things. spending on affordable housing remains marginal, spending on homeownership subsidies remains immense and there certainly has been no interest in intervening in urban planning. while the ndp's proposal remains insufficient in some important ways, it's frankly in a different world than liberal policy which will largely maintain the status quo.",liberals

i'm going to answer this because i think it's really the one and only important question here. it's not about why, it's about whether it happens, and the answer is yes. there are a good number of cases overturned in appeals for being either too harsh or too lenient.

guilty determination on illegal possession of a handgun, no matter the facts surrounding it should still warrant a minimum punishment, and has a degree of punishment we would consider excessive. mandatory minimums and mandatory maximums give an appropriate range for a crime. and if you're going to strike down a mandate for sentencing i find it absurd and hypocritical that the government only thinks it's acceptable to remove criteria to mandate minimum punishment, and not maximum punishment as well. if you want the judges to have latitude, you should at least be arguing for it at both ends.",liberals

the world’s problems are mostly seen as very far away and canada, thanks to geography and the united states don’t have to worry about external threats.

the problem is that this enables governments in canada to treat the military as a means to garner votes, which is fine, but not as a means of defense both of canada and canadian interests.

the issue is that with climate change, our arctic is going to become contested and at the same time, the world is lurching towards conflict, by proxy or otherwise between the big powers. the current inward looking view of the electorate and the politicians is similar to the view held prior to world war ii. it may be that like back then, the views could change and yet again, as with mackenzie king’s appeasement of hitler, trudeau and the liberals could be caught flat-footed.

i think the initial rollout went too quickly for the feds and the provinces were not ready to handle it. however, now that it is legal it should stay legal and the conservatives have vowed not to re-criminalize recreational usage.

i am not sure how serious a medical ban would be if recreational use is still legal? is this a concern for potentially insurance coverage for purchasing it?

i am indifferent for the cultivation of cannabis with up to a 4 plant allowance as my province has already outlawed that. however, i could see merit in there being a medical exemption for growing up to 4 plants even in provinces with recreational cultivation bans. but, i do not really see the necessity if the local cannabis commission or private retailer can provide cannabis for these person that medically require it, you can even get it shipped to your front door now in most places.

as long as they continue to vow to keep cannabis recreationally legal i will be happy. if there is policy in adjacent areas to that and i am not happy it is not a deal breaker as i would rather attempt to use grassroots influence to change the policy than vote for another party.",conservatives

spadina-fort york demographics changed a lot over the years from when olivia chow was mp. with the expansion of city place and liberty village it would be very tough for paul to chip away those voters. in toronto danforth the liberals actually increased their margin from 2015 to 2019, it’s a riding that’s actually becoming more and more liberal. davenport may be a good riding but it would be very very tough as this is pretty much a swing riding between liberals and ndp. with her stepping in the game it might actually benefit either one of the ndp or liberals. 

on top of that she would be running in a national election instead of a by election. this means there won’t be the same media attention as there was in the by election. personally i think she should have ran in bc but considering she already announced ontario, her best bet would be guelph.",liberals
