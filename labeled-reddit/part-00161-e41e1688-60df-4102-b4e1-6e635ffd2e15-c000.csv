the point is that trudeau has clearly had quite some time to reform the housing market in canada, and he didn't. many of the reforms he's proposing now have been either previously promised by his own government, or his government has actively voted against them. his secretary for housing has argued that even after a 30-40% increase in housing costs, even a 10% move towards affordability is impossible. people aren't spreading lies when they question trudeau's authenticity on housing.",liberals

it's not just that.  like justin trudeau might be the most famous canadian ever.  he's 10x more famous than gretzky now.  the only people arguably more internationally famous are a handful of actors and singers (think gosling, bieber, shania twain, celine deion, ryan renolds, jim carrey, maybe drake)....  it's a pretty short list.. and few of them are really famous for \"being canadian.\"  people talk about trudeaumania, but jt was more famous than his dad on his first day in office.  like there are lots of people where trudeau is pretty much all they know about canada.  just that our pm is a hottie.  he's a really unique character.  like his name might have helped in in the election some, but it certainly didn't make him a global figure.  

he is uniquely famous, and possibly the most well known canadian on earth.  like i think if you could ask all 7-8 billion people, \"name a famous canadian\" justin trudeau would be by far the number one answer.  i think it is extremely unlikely his kids will be more famous, and it's an open question how popular he'll be in 20 years.  and it's not automatic either.  like if ben harper or ben mulroney run for pm one day, i doubt they'll have the same international draw.   there's more to it than just a famous name or having a pretty face.",liberals

it's not the support of firearms that caused o'toole to lose my confidence; it's that he _flipped_ on his support of firearms. progressive fearmongers don't seem to understand how devastating that flip was to the tory campaign; and yet the rise in ppc support and the fall in tory support roughly aligned with that hitting the news cycle. (i went green, before someone leaps to suggest i'm a _racist ppc supporter_).

&gt; the simple fact is that rendering itself forever beholden to western interests has become a liability — particularly so in the case of alberta, but to a lesser extent as well in saskatchewan and manitoba. erin o’toole’s biggest struggle as leader has been in retaining the support of the true believers while making inroads into the more centrist interests of eastern provinces, especially ontario.

you know what'd be nice? if the ndp and grits took a moment to consider how fragile the tory hold on their votes is, and made some effort to court those tory voters. they could start by not using firearms as a scapegoat for failing drug war, anti-gang, and cbsa management policies.",conservatives

\\- everyone who would vote for a conservative/ppc candidate is intolerant and wants to whitewash history

none of which is remotely true, these are *stereotypes.* there are many issues that concern individual citizens in any election, and many differences between individual candidates (see: difference between provincial conservative parties in nova scotia versus alberta) - and any one of them could inspire a voter to vote a certain way and be totally legitimate.

oversimplifying it to \"one party are all racist oil lovers and the other side are all good people who want ubi and free houses\", or \"one party wants to support canadian businesses and workers and the other wants to steal all our money from taxes to pay for immigrants in toronto\" is ridiculous and infantile.

generally, i don’t like the trudeau showmanship on this. it’s starting to look like the early vaccine deliveries were a political stunt and i’m interested to know how much we paid for them.

but, it doesn’t change the fact that the mass media hysteria is not helpful. for most of this pandemic they have done more harm than good, across the entire political spectrum and i’d argue that they have made it difficult for any government to devise a thoughtful response and adhere to it.",liberals

completely overthrowing the \"capatalists\" and then having a few people plan everything has been tried and it has been quite a marked failure throughout history.   

captial does have its purposes, as the proper allocation of it in a market-based system has created fabulous outcomes for humanity.    

the other thing to consider is starting companies using a socialist-style mindset.   find an area that you work in and start a company that is completely and evenly owned by the workers.   i bet that the time would be ripe to start to change the system from the inside, especially after the pandemic plenty of people are mad enough that they are quitting en masse.    could be the time to shine!

i also completely disagree that it is some kind of conspiracy against signgh (and we will keep this to canadian politics).   there is no need to have a conspiracy to hold back anti-capitalists by the media, there are large parts of the population that simply don't pay attention to these views because they are too extreme.   singh has great views on things, and i think that there is a great point to saying the system is inherently broken right now... but a violent uprising against justin trudeau and the minority government?   doesn't sound effective to me.",liberals

additionally the liberals never intended to balance the budget when they came in, quite the opposite, they wanted to undo what mulroney had done, but the rating agencies stepped in and said no. it was only after ralph klein took the slash and burn approach and won over in alberta that martin decided to use the political cover provided by the agencies to go against his party's inclinations and right the ship.

martin deserves the credit for doing the job, but it was hardly a work of immaculate conception.

harper has him beat regardless. not only did he set up a proper keynesian stimulus program to pull canada through an economic crisis (take note trudeau), he balanced the budget himself when he was done. that's got to be an unmatched feat in canadian politics.

currently, i'd argue that trudeau's biggest threat doesn't come from the cpc, but from his own party since the liberal brass might be worried about trudeau's last two electoral performances and opt for a fresh face as leader. though i'd argue that currently, it doesn't really matter who the liberals have as leader because they face no real electoral threats to their hegemony. the worst possible liberal performance right now would translate to the cpc winning a weak minority next election with slightly more seats and the lpc having to agree to ndp/bloc concessions to form a coalition etc. (and even that seems unlikely).",liberals

&gt; [i've] never had to go further than a few blocks or wait more than 10 minutes to vote, including the last election.

that's nice for you. i voted by mail last election, and had a very easy time of it myself. doesn't change the fact that the *only* neighbourhoods with a designated polling place halfway across the city was in an ndp stronghold, and the *only* polling stations with hour-plus (let alone 2-3 hours) lines on election day were the two polling stations bordering the university campus.

i doubt the liberals took action to block voting in poorer or student areas, but the logistical problems that led to this were predictable, and the disparity in \"ease of voting\" in my riding *predictably* benefited the liberal party.

but since you're bringing up \"never had to go more than a few blocks or wait ten minutes to vote\" in a way that implies that what i'm saying *isn't* true:

**wait disparity:** 

[here's a polling place](https://imgur.com/a/kgbddsy) in my city from a neighbourhood that was full of comfortable, liberal-heavy homeowners. there were maybe a dozen people in line, and the polling station served about 3k residents.

[here are](https://imgur.com/a/7hfo0y9) the pics that i took at the polling station abutting the university campus. the line goes a full block on the left, before continue onto the lawn of the polling station. off to the left, the line continued a full block. later in the day, the line was *worse*, extending a further block off the left and turning into a packed coil on the lawn.

**turning people away at the polls:**

*this* is the location that ran out of registration forms at some point in the afternoon and began *turning people away* if they got to the line but needed to register on the spot. i have no way of knowing the exact time in the afternoon this began, but it continued until almost 8pm when i physically handed the polling official a stack of registration forms so that people could vote.

**distance to polls:**

see [this image?](https://imgur.com/a/vyzwn47) take a look at \"st luke's anglican\" just a bit southwest of the image's center. it's an ndp stronghold. about half the people living near it could vote there. to see where the *other* half had to go, follow the long line tracing toward the portuguese cultural center [3km away](https://www.google.ca/maps/dir/st.+luke's+anglican+church,+236+nelson+st,+kingston,+on+k7k+4m7/portuguese+cultural+centre+of+kingston,+division+street,+kingston,+on/@44.2484361,-76.5174452,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cd2aba12ee06c05:0x759d5190e72bdc98!2m2!1d-76.5023008!2d44.2377001!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cd2abe9d1bb4c1b:0x99db4937e33a3042!2m2!1d-76.49726!2d44.2591081!3e2) (correction on before: 65min walk round-trip, not each way, assuming you're healthy and fit). [this panorama picture](https://imgur.com/qv5ivdb) shows st luke's on the right: across from it on the left, the low-rise apartments' residents had to do 6km round trip in order to vote. there was a periodic shuttle bus being offered, but a large fraction of the people decided not to bother when they found out how long traveling to vote would take them.

---

meanwhile, residents of the liberal-heavy suburbs and wealthy homeowner areas had voting experiences similar to yours. but no, please do tell me more about how i didn't see people have to go several kms to vote, or wait in 2-3 hour lines a *second* time after being turned away because they didn't think they'd need a lot of hard-copy registration forms in an area full of students.

if you're saying that this *wasn't* predictable and didn't benefit the liberals in my riding, then you're either unaware or being dishonest.

---

edit: 

&gt; maybe making statements like “young people and renters never vote” is really insulting to a lot of people, “less likely” might be more tactful than painting entire demographics as non-voters.

i absolutely didn't say that. i said that, in my riding, the neighbourhoods that were full of young people or full of renters were the only ones where voting took *real* commitment. the reason why i even *became* aware that people were being turned away from the polls is because a handful of students waited hours in line, got turned away for lack of registration forms, spend half an hour helping me to understand that the problem was *actually* as stupid as it sounded, and then *they got back in line a second time*. that's not an indictment of young people at all. it's the reason why i'm fucking furious.

&gt; risk #1. the mother is severely harmed, potentially killed by the pregnancy

&gt; risk #2 the child is murdered

&gt; either way someone is being harmed, there's no getting around that issue. the question is who takes precedence, and in what way can you balance these two risks in some reasonable manner. how you could manage those two risks, i'm not gonna pretend to know.

exactly. that's why the law is the way it is. because you cannot make a perfect law in this case, each situation is different and has to be handled by the pregnant person and their doctor.

&gt;&gt; i didn't say you couldn't have an opinion. literally everyone would tell you a person asking for an abortion at 20+ weeks because they changed their mind is a terrible person. and many of them would still be for the current legal status of abortion in canada. including me, because i don't think that person exists.

&gt; then why are we subsidizing these people? i have to pay for this terrible person to murder their child, in a sense i'm now morally complicit to this. i didn't consent to have my labor subsidize the death of a child. i'd wager it's highly probable at some point in canadian history that person did exist.

this argument has no merit, you are not subsidizing these people (who again, i do not believe exist at all), because a doctor in our medical system would not perform an abortion at 20+ weeks for no significant reason. this person, if they exist, needs to find an equally terrible doctor to do this, and that doctor has to justify this major surgery to their hospital, which involves dozens of other nurses and administration, all of which would have to be equally terrible people for us to have never heard of a case like this happening. its just an absurd idea.",liberals

so yeah, go ahead and buy a panel van and plaster stickers all over the sides of it. you're welcome to do all of that, run a big campaign with petitions and town hall appearances, and whatever else you've got the budget for, and fail to convince a meaningful number of people that you're right. because i'll eat my toque if you can sway even 1% of the population to your side. bigger groups have been trying for a long time, and guess what, abortion hasn't become illegal for all their trying!

yeah, cuz it's a mass produced model which lessens cost and pushes the availability further

&gt; can fire off a lot of rounds quickly

not without already-illegal modification. you'll be disappointed to know that most guns allow for enough flexibility to meet this criteria and the knowhow of gun customization isn't exactly rocket science. 

&gt; its kinetic energy absolutely shreds bodies

this is often relevant about the bullet type(size vs mass) and speed playing a separate role, and there are quite a few rifles that can be modified enough to change this

you can argue deterrence all you like, but someone criminally insane enough to commit a mass murder will find a way. much like abortions, these bans typically only harm those who were interested in working within the law to begin with. 

handguns still reign supreme for armed homicide, and the majority of gun crimes in our country are not from guns acquired legally. outright bans are just symbolic theatre similar to the tsa/catsa. 

sorry, can't really read the source article...but the comments seem much more willing to tear it apart anyway, especially since most of your argument seems to be custom parts and accessories. we already have heavy restrictions on these things. 

i understand where you come from. i've been on that side of the debate before, and the empathy it invokes is completely understandable. though as i go further into leftist ideals, i do not see bans as an effective prevention tool. *ultimately*, my point is that this ban will not mitigate these murders as effectively as you would believe.

it's an easy win to keep the blue tory base in line. but it's meaningless because ford ultimately is responsible here. similar to the attacks on trudea for the airports during covid. yes the feds could do a better job with controlling in/out travel. but the second anyone stepped foot on ontario soil it was 100% within the opc and provincial government to enforce quarantine and public health matters. he did nothing except run commercials how it was trudeau's fault. do you think ford's base cares? you think the anti-trudeau crowd cares for what the truth is? the commercials from ford just confirmed their existing bias.",liberals

he9xhqk,2021-09-25T08:39:01.000-07:00,"ndp ranks question leadership after election disappointments | cbc news i remember a rather niche criticism of the ndp platform during the campaign, that they didn't have a plan for gig workers. the tories did (albeit a heavily criticized one). but if they want to be a legitimate \"worker's party\", the ndp should be the ones spearheading initiatives to improve workers' rights in a changing economy.

i think this is a broader problem with social democratic parties around the world. the ndp, the british labour party, etc have always been a marriage of socialist intellectuals who are more idealistic, and working-class voters who are more looking out for their interests. private-sector unions (differentiating from public-sector unions because they have a different dynamic) were the bridge that connected these two groups that have always disagreed on many social issues, but found common cause on economics. the decline of unions has made it harder for left parties to connect with the working class.

the ndp can't be blamed for the decline of private-sector unions. but the early autopsies of the ndp's showing this time seems to suggest that they didn't focus enough on organizing and mobilizing, and spent too much time on building a national brand centred around singh. but singh isn't a natural choice for these voters - put aside the fact that many old-school workers are more socially conservative, singh comes from a rather cosmopolitan background. he has very little in common with miners in timmins, or auto workers in oshawa. you don't have to be a hard hat yourself to win over working-class voters, after all, jack layton was the privileged son of a federal cabinet minister, a classic \"champagne socialist\". but the ndp under mcdonough and layton spent a lot of time organizing in working class areas and getting those voters out. northern ontario for example was a safe liberal region until layton made inroads by running excellent local candidates with connection to the voters. layton's 2004, 2006 and 2008 campaigns were pretty localized, until 2011 when he struck gold with quebec and the campaign went national, naturally. since then, the ndp has struggled under his shadow, trying to race back to being a national party rather than a more localized one that made inroads over time.

people say the ndp are \"liberals in a hurry\", but it seems like the ndp themselves are acting like \"ndp in a hurry\", and neglecting places like hamilton mountain (which had a shitty ndp candidate and flipped liberal) and timmins-james bay (where angus lost a lot of votes and it seems working-class voters shifted to the ppc).",liberals

i also think they should get rid of bill blair - he's a liability and the wrong person in public safety - you don't want a former police chief involved in violations of civil liberty running policing in a post-blm world, and his handling of the rcmp in general and ns shooting has been terrible.  marco mendicino is another good candidate to drop - was only recently put into cabinet, poor handling of afghan immigration situation, revelation of racist aides that he hired, and just the fact that a mediocre white male from the gta has no value taking up a spot.",liberals
