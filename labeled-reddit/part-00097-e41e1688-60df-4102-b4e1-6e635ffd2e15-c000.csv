it may be a quebec that white quebecois person who experienced the quiet revolution is more comfortable living in - because let's be 100% real, that is the *actual* goal of laïcité in quebec regardless of what is stated - but that does not make it a more free, or more equal, or necessarily better place. this criticism is not exclusively levelled at quebec, either - france has had more than its fair share of issues explaining and defending laïcité in the 120 years or so that it's been government policy.

and like, if that's what you want, that's ... fine? i mean it's not personally fine to me because i see it like ensuring wheelchair users have good access to the stairs, but it's a viewpoint you can have and there is a philosophy that attempts to defend it. 

i think the biggest problem in the conversation is twofold -

1.) that people just drop \"it's laïcité you just don't *understand* it,\" and walk around like a pigeon on a chessboard.

2.) the majority of anglophones haven't investigated the philosophy behind it to adequately critique it, and have no meaningful way of responding to the pigeon because the pigeon is right, they *don't* understand it.

neither of the people involved are willing to confront or defend what it means to employ the philosophy in a society, and how its real world implementation affects the people who live in that society in unequal measures. 

if your viewpoint is \"this affects some people worse than others but i'm okay with that for x,y,z reasons,\" then that's fine. people use the same argument for types of taxation so it's not as if it's a foreign concept. if your viewpoint is \"this affects some people worse than others and i'm not okay with that for x,y,z reasons,\" then that's also fine. 

what isn't okay is the current line a lot of people on this subreddit have come out with, defending the laïcité with a viewpoint that \"this affects us all equally and it's discriminatory against quebecois for anyone to question it.\" is this an exaggeration? sightly, but not much. this is the choice the majority in quebec has made, and you must justify it if you do not want to live with the criticism levelled in your direction.",conservatives

if they really didn't care about it, it would probably have gone the way of electoral reform or pharmacare. something that is brought up every election cycle before getting erased from the party's website once the votes are cast.

instead, in just the nine months since april of 2021 when the policy was more or less announced, the liberals have signed a deal with every provincial or territorial government except ontario and nunavut. for something they apparently didn't want to do, they have certainly expended a lot of ministerial and financial resources to get deals with almost the whole country.

if we want to be cynical, and i'm certainly open to cynicism about government, i would be comfortable saying that the liberals thought the policy was stupid in 2015. then in 2021, with an election coming, they realized that this was popular because cheaper childcare is usually popular, and decided to make it their big tent-pole policy for the election campaign. in this case they wanted to do it, but only because it was going to help them win an election.

cynically as well, i could say that, if trudeau really will step down before this term ends, this and legal pot will be his big legacy items that he can put in every post-retirement book he writes like jean chretien and not invading iraq.

either way, i think my point stands. even if the trudeau government didn't believe in the policy initially, they absolutely wanted to do this. even if the reasons for which they did it are less than altruistic.

about the media, i see no reason to not just say exactly what happened, which is reaffected to other tasks. even if people assume she lost salary or consider it effectively being fired, that's fine. they can make their own opinion.

i didn't assume she did it on purpose, she outright admitted it in an interview. as i said they don't enforce unless there are complaints. you know, it's the kind of law that's in place to have a tool available to intervene in extreme situations.

for example, jaywalking is illegal in the roc (again a bit different here, i was actually really confused about this in ontario). however, people will still jaywalk. the police won't fine everyone crossing a street, it really depends on the context and if you're really doing something dangerous or disrupting traffic.

an even more vague law we have here is strolling is illegal (flânage). obviously they don't go around fining everyone talking a walk and chilling outside. but it's often used when people cause problems, disrupt peace, harass people, etc, without clearly making an infraction. they'll get a fat strolling ticket. it's basically illegal to be outside without a destination, crazy eh? yet no one knows about it. because it's never enforced. i know because i was a little shit as a teen and got hit with a... well deserved strolling ticket.

now i'm not saying i agree with vague ass laws because it gives too much discretionary power and is inherently arbitrary and unfair. i'm just saying, that's what actually happening. they put this there to have something when people complain about state authority figures trying to shove religion down people's throat. even if we only look at catholics, this is something real that does still happen.

what she did is have her school fill a complaint about herself, on purpose. it was agreed upon. reminder that it's an english school who have basically 0 oversight from the minister of education. it was a statement.

i respect her decision, it's a legal way to protest. however, i dislike how english media is hiding this. it's an important part of the situation. she isn't a martyr, she is an activist making a statement.

remember that the court can overrule any bill. cnesst has legal powers and the labour court is there to enforce the regulations of the cnesst. 

https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/en/client-services/complaints-recourses/situations-where-there-are-grounds-filing


&gt;workers may file a complaint if they believe that
their employer dismissed them without just cause; they are victims of prohibited practices, i.e., sanctions, discriminatory measures or reprisals on the part of their employer[...]

&gt;a pay equity complaint may be filed when prohibited conduct was observed when the initial pay equity exercise was done or in connection with the assessment of pay equity maintenance[...] 

https://www.cnesst.gouv.qc.ca/en/client-services/complaints-recourses/pay-equity-complaints/prohibited-conduct-complaint

&gt;what is prohibited conduct?
prohibited conduct includes acting in bad faith or in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner or exhibiting gross negligence toward workers in the company. 

&gt;discrimination
discrimination occurs when there is a distinction, exclusion or preference with respect to one or more people based on grounds provided for in the québec and canadian charters of human rights and freedoms (e.g., sex, age, religion). whether intentional or not, discrimination compromises the right to full equality in exercising a right. for example, excluding a group of workers from pay equity work because the group is comprised mostly of predominantly female job classes constitutes discrimination. 

as you can see, this is rather easy to contest with cnesst, and if they don't act, you appeal at labour court. i can't find the english documents of everything because cnesst is french, but their laws are extremely clear on the fact that you can't fire nor touch salary on the basis of discrimination of religion, and that if you are reassigned, you don't take a salary hit",conservatives

uh huh.

section 2(b) - freedom of expression, incl. freedom of the press, freedom of speech, etc. trudeau has attempted to bar certain journalists or media outlets from attending his events. he's also passed bills that limit freedom of expression under the guise of \"hate speech\", and continues to attempt to pass more bills doing the same to a greater degree.

section 2(c) freedom of assembly - particularly during the pandemic, there have been limits imposed on protests, often selectively. several anti-lockdown protests have been shut down and deemed illegal due to the public health measures, while other protests were allowed to proceed and even had trudeau attend in-person, violating those same public health restrictions.

section 2(d) freedom of association also comes into question when imposing limits on gathering sizes, shutting down churches, etc.

section 6 - mobility rights. every citizen in canada has the right to move to any province, and the right to enter and return to canada at-will. the federal government has trampled all over this throughout the past 2 years. in fact, the unvaccinated are currently not allowed to leave the country. that is a gross violation of section 6.

section 7 - right to life, liberty, and security of person. this one is longer and multi-faceted, but again, the key point being \"section 7 also protects a sphere of personal autonomy involving “inherently private choices” that go to the “core of what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence” - \"this aspect of liberty includes the right to refuse medical treatment (a.c., supra, at paragraphs 100-102, 136) and the right to make “reasonable medical choices” without threat of criminal prosecution:\". also from security of person - security of the person includes a person’s right to control his/her own bodily integrity. it will be engaged where the state interferes with personal autonomy and a person's ability to control his or her own physical or psychological integrity, for example by prohibiting assisted suicide or regulating abortion or imposing unwanted medical treatment (r. v. morgentaler, [1988] 1 s.c.r. 30 at 56; carter, supra; rodriguez, supra; blencoe, supra at paragraph 55; a.c., supra, at paragraphs 100-102).

section 8 - rights against unreasonable search and seizure. having firearms forcibly confiscated without the person having done anything wrong is unreasonable. this isn't dependent on there being a \"charter right to own firearms\", but rather just a fundamental concept that government doesn't get to just arbitrarily steal your stuff.

section 9 - pretty heftily violated by the quarantine hotels. detaining someone like that is certainly arbitrary, since the rules have changed several times, and there's no evidence backing it or logical reason as to why someone who has tested negative needs to be locked in a hotel room for two weeks.

lets break that in two.

just asking for clarification here. do you mean that my *framing of* p2 is dismissive? if so, why? or do you mean that my objections to p2 are dismissive? i think i dismiss it with sufficient rationale, but i could be persuaded otherwise. i think it's at least plausible enough that \"blatantly false\" is hyperbole.

this one is sort of hard to figure out. the federal ndp has never \"won the popular vote\" in its 60-year history. they came closest in 2011, when they lost that metric by 10% to the cpc. they beat the liberals that year, so i'm assuming that's what you meant, because otherwise i really don't understand you.

in fy2011-14, inclusive, the ndp raised competitive amounts of money. their financial troubles really set in after 2015, when they were definitely *not* the popular vote winners.

even if it were true, however, there are good reasons to doubt whether fundraising capacity equals governance capability. one reason the ndp struggles is that it has fewer supporters than the two bigger parties, and it systematically has the poorest supporters of any of the 5 parties that won seats in the last election. if you represent the interests of poor people, it will be harder to raise funds, irrespective of your financial management ability.

moreover, given your flair says you're a liberal, explain why the cpc systematically outraises the lpc if they aren't also better at managing the government.",liberals

however we are sitting on some of the lowest corp tax rates since the 80's (we're currently avg at 26%, all time high was the 80s with 50%). i could see them adjust those corp rates to help pay. shifting the ei and cpp premiums a company pays to corp tax, plus a good claw back (of the ubi) at higher income levels would be more plausible.

the argument over stagflation, and many other arguments on the negative are ignoring lbjs economic policies of the 60's. although it wasn't ubi he did avoid recessions, lowered unemployment throughout his terms, and lessened the wealth gap significantly. if your middle class these policies had you gain wealth at at faster rate than the wealthy. i'm not opposed to that. reganomics followed lbj and the wealth gap is increasing rapidly.",liberals

i disagree that this is a great contrast.  i think it's effective for the ndp base, but it speaks to a fundamental disgust for economic inequality that i don't think is necessarily shared by the swing center-left voter.

it would be one thing if trudeau were saying \"we all need to tighten our belts, so we're raising the gst to pay for stuff\" against singh's \"let's tax the rich more,\" but so far the liberals have not shown much sign of wanting to raise new revenues.  the political balance between \"raise taxes on the rich\" and \"don't raise taxes on anybody\" is not obvious to me.

now, in the context of an ndp convention there's a lot being left implied.  for want of taxes on the rich, the ndp will understand, the government hasn't implemented pharmacare or student debt relief or generous reconciliation or any number of other social priorities.  but for the general public, this is a subtle argument because the lpc will undoubtedly have at least a façade of implementation for any such policy that gets real political momentum.

&gt;
there are serious political implications with demographic shifts

i think that is a serious issue, tbf, even though i am an immigrant myself. i have seen what has happened in vancouver, parts of toronto,etc. my concern with my immigrant contemporaries is that they are forming something less than ghetos, a concerned shared by many other immigrants like myself. many immigrants especially from india have settled in the area of brampton and it has literally become a gheto. i personally believe that should not be the case, as it itself is an obstacle to the idea of diversity. as an immigrant your only identity once you have immigrated should be that of a canadian. sure you bring your own culture and values but don't object to those of the country you immigrated too.
for instance, sometime back muslims in europe, i think it was netherlands  protested the use of pork by locals, something they had been doing for decades in decades old recipes. (eating pork is an offense in islam)

now, i am a vegetarian, never had meat in my whole life ,  but that doesn't mean i go on telling others to stop eating what they want just cause my religion doesn't allow it or something!

also, i know i may get hate for this but here it is. i feel the current head of govt. is involved voluntarily in minority appeasement. 
for instance, the recent comment on the protests in india against capitalism in farming. a comment from a head of state miles away i think wasn't required especially when canada is facing the pandemic with repeated lockdowns and economic challenges..
we all know the comment was to appease to the sikh community a part of which is terror sympathizers.

wait, what?

the entire point of describing alcoholism as a hereditary disease is because it is. you are more prone to alcoholism if your parents were alcoholic. 

wiki:
&gt; someone with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to become an alcoholic themselves

to compare that to being gay suggests that being gay *is harmful* in ways comparable to *alcoholism*. do you...not see how supremely messed up that position is?

&gt; you can retrain yourself to break any habit

you still haven't explained why someone would need to *stop being gay* as if it is harmful. the only harmful thing about being gay is the way that other people in society treat you as somehow broken or diseased which is literally your line of argumentation right now. 

&gt; you're denying that its impossible to manage urges? i guess i never quit smoking then considering its impossible to overcome what your brain tells you to want.

jesus what a bad take. are you unaware that some people acquire diseases and that diseases can't be stopped by simply wiling it away? you can't be serious right now.

in a way that isn't representative of ct as it is practiced. i like how you moved the goal posts there in order to have to avoid backing up your bullshit. no no! ct isn't evil! look, i defined it in a way that isn't evil! 

&gt; looks like you're here to just spin in circles confirming what you know and not contend with the point at hand.

&gt;if you think that centre-right ppl are ok with banning 2nd term abortions, and/or transition surgery, give your head a shake

the center-right position on abortion is to ban abortions at the 3rd and 2nd trimesters. the centrist opinion is to ban only 3rd trimester abortions. even with this im being very charitable and liberal with this stance. you cant get much more left wing than not supporting bans on 3rd-trimester abortions also. so i dont know what the heck you are thinking of really.

&gt;the definition of a centre-right person is usually fairly simple, socially liberal and fiscally conservative

if you read my post. you would have seen that i wasnt talking about the \"center right\" in general. i was talking about the ***social/cultural center-right.*** so economic stuff are out the window.

&gt;socially liberal and fiscally conservative, aka a red tory.

that is not what a red tory is, sure that what the delusional media calls it. but that isnt what red toryism is, the only thing you have to do, to understand this is to at least read wikipedia.

\"a red tory is an adherent of a centre-right or paternalistic-conservative political philosophy derived from the tory tradition, most predominantly in canada but also in the united kingdom.(wikipedia, \"red tory\") \"

&amp;#x200b;

red toryism is a permutation of paternalistic conservatism. which came into existence as a derivative of one nation conservatism from benjamin disraeli. so if you know any history, and have done the basics of research. you would understand that red torism is that exact opposite of what you think it is. red toryism is center to left economically, and right-wing socially.

in fact the \"red\" in red toryism exist because red is associated with the labor and socialist(economically left-wing) movements throughout history.

of course it’s a good idea from a personal risk mitigation point of view for someone working at home with virtually zero chance of exposure to wait a few extra days to get a vaccine with a lower chance of complications. 

the problem is most people will not view this in a purely statistical manner. a lot of people are simply going to take the naci statement as saying “avoid this vaccine, it’s not safe. wait until you can get this other one”. 

1/100,000 chance of complication is only ~377 canadians. that’s not a trivial number but canada has over 24,000 covid related deaths (1/1,571). people need to get vaccinated as soon as possible, not be worried about such a small chance of having complications.",liberals

the big thing is, as you say, that gen x and boomers almost all own their homes, so even though virtually no one of a child rearing age does anymore, and it's a massive social problem, the majority of canadians would be against a move on housing prices.

this is not a \"new process\" for parliament. *that's the whole issue.*

this panel is not a parliamentary committee. it's a \"private\" panel formed by the pmo, and the pmo can show these people whatever they want, withhold whatever they want, and do whatever they want. 

why is that? parliament and parliamentary committees have the right to require the government to produce documents. a private panel does not. they get to see whatever the pmo chooses to show them.

so the next question is why can't this panel take the role of a parliamentary committee?

having a process to truncate parliamentary privilege for security issues would require 1) parliamentary involvement and 2) unanimous agreement.

this has neither. the pm cannot just impose an extra-parlimentary \"solution\" without parliamentary procedures, privileges, or accountability to strip parliamentary privilege. that's not how this works.

if the info is not being directly provided to parliment, parliment needs to unanimously agree on an alternative. 

that's what happened in 2009/2010, but that has not happened here.

that's called automatic; they are already banned under firearms regulations. the ones that jt banned, the ar-15, are single trigger pull - single shot. that's called semi-automatic and a large portion of modern firearms have them. jt uses fear of firearms to push that he's doing something, when really, he's just banning a firearm that isn't any more powerful or dangerous in the wrong hands than a hunting rifle. home protection is not a valid reason to get your firearms license, say that on your possession and acquisition license application or to the chief firearms officer and you will get rejected for a license. you are supposed to call 9-1-1, not shoot first ask questions later. you are onto something with target practice though. handguns are used for ipsc competitions, check them out!

\"i’m part of lgbt and strongly support same sex marriage, equal adoption chance, and being able to transition to the opposite sex (and be treated as one aside from very few situations like medical ones where birth sex is relevant). i believe one should be able to medically do so once you are past the age of consent. i’m unsure of my opinion on non binary, but will call someone they if asked to. i don’t believe that there are any other genders that have any type of scientific validity behind them (some studies have been able to find transgenderism in brain scans but no other genders). i don’t believe people should be forced to agree with lgbt as long as they can give them equal respect.\"

in the past, conservatives voted against same-sex marriage, but the official party stance has evolved since then. since you aren't forcing your views on the social conservative wing, no problems here.

\"i hate the concept of the majority of cancel culture when it’s a load of imperfect people destroying a public figure who was put on a pedestal for making a mistake that shouldn’t be punished beyond a sincere apology and behavior adjustment. i think in some cases when the 'crime' is severe, it's justified though.\"

sounds like you are more socially conservative than you realize.... not a bad thing. i think cancel culture has gotten out of control too.

\"i dislike the idea of people from oppressed groups living in a victim mentality, opposed to at least trying their best to better their life through merit (i'm aware this issue involves more factors than that statement though).\"

again, good on you for realizing that there is a large chunk of the population that just wants to ride for free.

\"i'm pro holding police/authorities accountable for unjustified brutality, and everyone having the right to peaceful protest, but i don't support looting or violent rioting in at least most situations.\"

if a police officer violates the criminal code, they should be charged. the problem is the culture within law enforcement of covering for other's mistakes, not prosecutorial issues. sounds like you are also against the thinly veiled blm movement. it's not about black lives, or whatever other color of skin tone you want to promote, it's about minorities becoming racists against others and not realizing it.

\"i’m not religious but support religious and cultural freedom if it’s nonviolent (justifying beating your kid or an honor killing for example i strongly disagree with). i’m strongly against my country using laws to make people adhere to a specific religion (like the case of r vs big m drug mart)\"

canada has separation of church and state, the conservative party won't change that.

\"i believe weed should be legal for a few reasons like medicinal potential, less harmful and deadly than booze and cigs, less clogging up court/prison, likely criminalizing many young people and making it harder for them to work and contribute later, etc. i’m not sure about other drugs with no medicinal or safe recreational potential like hard ones because i don't think arresting a meth addict will cure their addiction, but i don't think meth should be allowed in society.\"

yes, many conservatives were against this, but now, we aren't so much against cannabis itself than against the lousy rollout of the legalization. legal cannabis has not displaced the black market because the pricing and quality is decoupled with reality. also, a lot of the cannabis start-ups are failing and stock prices built on valuations based on inventory which will ultimately be turned into distillate at pennies on the dollar. this rollout has been a botch job and i'll be pushing my local conservative mp to improve that. it could be a profitable business and conservatives are for small business and start-ups. as for harm reduction, we have to be careful that the black market isn't the only source, or else they will just benefit from opening up the flood gates.

while being bad proportionally, irv still has a few things going for it that make it much better than fptp.

1. easy to implement:  you don't change the number of mp's, and you don't redraw boundaries so there's no potential constitutional issues.  while more complex than fptp, it's possible to do without electronic voting. (which seems to be a priority for elections canada for whatever reason)

2. easy to explain:  as much as i love stv, it can difficult for people that don't care about er to understand.  cgpgrey's video on it makes it about as easy as it can be, but sample stv ballots look intimidating.  irv is fairly easy to explain to someone whether they care about er or not.

3. ends strategic voting:  everyone is free to vote for whatever party they want to, even when they know that party \"has no chance\" without throwing their vote away, or potentially leading to a candidate they dislike winning.  this is my main reason for liking irv.

4. punishes extreme/unpopular opinions:  currently the conservatives can win majorities every so often even though they hold positions that the majority of canadians find destructive.  under irv, the need to appeal to voters as a second choice drives parties to consider how their policies impact people outside of their core base, and it nudges them to accept positions that appeal to a larger number of canadians.  (that's a very good thing)

5.  keeps extreme views out of parliament:  not much to explain here.  strong green candidates would still win their seats, and you may see more greens win in general as environmentally focused voters don't have to worry about a cpc win from vote splitting.

6. everyone elected has the acceptance of at least 50% of the voters.

obviously stv is superior in many ways, but i see far more hurdles to selling it to the public as well as achieving it.  i just want fptp gone, and i see irv as the most achievable option, with a goal of having it become multi-member ridings later to get stv.",conservatives

so the government will say a few nice things, notch up some political speaking points, smile and do the absolute bare minimum and wait for things to quiet down again and for the country to get bored with this topic ... which i'm guessing will last another month or two.

singh does offer alternative policies, i just think they're somewhat utopian and impractical. the engineering joke is: \"everything! for free! yesterday!\" the joke, of course, is that there's tradeoffs between ambition, cost, and speed.

cerb shows that the government can act quickly to put a **temporary** program in place, but for **permanent** new programs - child care, long-term care, pharmacare, plus the ndp want dental care, eye care, and ubi - there's a limit to how fast you can raise taxes, because of loss aversion. when there's economic growth, forgoing some gains in order to strengthen the social safety net isn't so painful; but when economic growth is slow and you raise taxes a lot, it's more like a zero-sum tradeoff between more public spending and less private spending.

hence the comment that the ndp are \"liberals in a hurry.\"

the other important constraint that the federal ndp have never had to deal with (since they've never held power) is regional divisions (\"national unity\"). the federal ndp promise to use \"50% + 1\" as the threshold for a future referendum on quebec independence; they argued that ottawa should block tmx, ignoring the impact on alberta (at a time when the alberta wing was governing alberta!).

one final thing that really surprised me was singh's saying in 2019 that if he met trump, he would tell him, \"you should be impeached.\" why not just poke him in the eye and see what happens?",liberals
