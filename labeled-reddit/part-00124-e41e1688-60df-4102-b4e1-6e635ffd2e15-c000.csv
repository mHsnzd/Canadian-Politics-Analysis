ok so not performing that abortion and putting that financial stress on the family is an example of doing no harm? or forcing a women to go through childbirth only to give it up to adoption is a solution? it's not. any reasonable person would avoid childbirth if they could. it's why these procedures aren't exactly rare.

&gt;not everyone can handle cutting apart a baby in the womb, and scraping the peices out. i imagine for many it would be a horrific experience, and they should have every right to choose not to be the one to do it, knowing there is someone else who will. 

that's not an abortion and don't try for a second to misrepresent what it is. there is no cutting of a baby in an abortion what the fuck? it's actually more of a suction. you clearly have no idea what an abortion actually entails. nice try.

please tell when a doctor is unsafe in an abortion procedure. again what are you saying. you clearly need some education so i suggest you youtube abortion procedure. there are many 5-10 minute videos that can fully explain that a doctor is never in danger with the procedure.",liberals

again, i’m pro-affordable housing. but if the solution is the half of canadians who own homes sacrifice their net worth, then i would say that isn’t a solution at all. you just shifted the burden on there other half of the population. 

unless they can come up with some sort of way to protect their net worths, i’m not sure what i’m in favour of. i wonder if it would be feasible to bring prices down and then allow home owners to right off losses on their home value come tax time. for someone making 100k that could be up to 20k a year, which would only take 5 years to recuperate a 100k loss on their home",conservatives

1. o'toole moderating picks up undecided lpc-cpc or ndp-cpc swing voters while losing votes to bernier

2. the anti-vax/lockdown/vp vote swinging to bernier isn't concentrated in regular cpc voters and he's pulling those votes from elsewhere, presumably mostly the greens judging by their recent corresponding polling decline

probably a bit of both, but the idea that the ppc and cpc draw from the exact same voters might be overrated. vaccine passports and lockdowns weren't even a thing in 2019 after all

i think the fearmongering around the cpc lead is overrated though. they led in the popular vote last time and weren't even close to winning a plurality of the seats, never mind forming government. let me know when they're got a &gt;4% lead in the average and they *might* have a chance at forming government.",conservatives

the issue is the workarounds need to be dealt with too and simply saying they'll ban them for a couple years as a pilot to test, it won't make that big a difference.

point 1: i can see where you're coming from, and i underatand your point. thinking of this problem from where i sit in southern ontario, well theres lots of places to go. but you're right that in very remote locations, there is the possibility of having to travel out of the way for an abortion. that said, you nor i, could possibly know the situations of the people in those locations. and who knows, most of them may have doctors who are willing to perform abortions, maybe they don't. maybe the people needing the abortions have plenty of money to travel for the procedure, maybe they need to borrow from family. we can't possibly know that. we are both just speculating at this point. but i would reckon theres people falling into each one of those scenarios. again, speculating here. that said, if a doctor cant stomach performing the procedure, what else can be done. i would be opposed to forcing doctors to perform the procedure against their will. i don't see that being constructive, or how it becomes our place to demand they set aside their moral obligations/opinion on the matter. i think that's alot to ask.

point 2: i think part of what i said has been taken out of context. and we are speculating that because a doctor chose not to do the procedure, that it never got performed anywhere else. ultimately, i think it is the responsibility of the person searching for the abortion, to find it for themselves. while i do realize in some cases, as we speculated above, that could prove difficult, i am of the opinion that it is still too much to ask of the doctor in this example, to set aside all their values for someone elses convenience.

point 3: fair, i can accept i messed up on that one. i wrote most of that while recalling a doctors testimonial of an abortion performed very late in the pregnancy, showing the tools used etc and explaining the procedure. that was not fair of me as that does not represent most abortions.

and point 4: i think this was definitely taken out of context, or maybe a bit too literally. that analogy was only meant to draw similarities, between the average persons right to refuse work, and a doctors right to refuse a procedure on moral grounds. (not to specicially say that doctors are in any way endangered during the procedure). for all intents and purposes i could have just chosen not to include that, the point was missed i guess.",liberals

dude come on, this whole fear that someone is coming to take quebec's culture away is a thing people like legault use. he could never reach those levels of support if he didn't. the other quebec centric parties are also not that great. pq and qs are the same garbage repackaged with different names. 

i know that the things done long ago were bad, but who is advocating for that bullshit anymore? i have no problem with quebec's special status, neither do many others. 

but signing stupid bills under the guise of protecting quebec's culture is just ridiculous. you can keep telling me that you voted for x or y. legault today has overwhelming support, from all voting blocs. 

&gt;québec is isolated from the rest of canada for historic reasons (you know, the anglo tried to do a cultural genocide here) but it is not more conservative than the rest of the country. i used alberta as an example bc they’re seen as more conservative, but i could’ve used ontario.

but you chose alberta, didn't you? that's all too common when it comes to criticisms towards quebec. here you are telling me that i'm making generalizations, but there you are generalizing against alberta, like many people do. it's not a quebec thing though, ontarians do it to all the time. i don't like it either. alberta has its problems, but it is by no means what people portray it as. calgary had a muslim mayor for 10 years and edmonton is very much an ndp stronghold. 

&gt;is propagated by anglo media for a reason: they don’t want québec to gain influence and credibility in canada.

yeah, i have a hard time believing this isn't bordering on conspiracy theory. a fat lot of good that has done them, because quebec is already pretty influential in everything related to canada. anyone in government has to know both languages. if you want to be the pm you better be ready to court the québécois, otherwise you're sunk, and don't even think about not speaking french or speaking crap french, because that will finish you. more than that quebec has special status, no other province does.

&gt; [aaron cosbey of iisd] and others also say that, while mr. trudeau’s liberals will not singlehandedly change the opinions of other governments averse to imposing carbon pricing, they might be able to help move the needle among those already considering it by highlighting how they were able to introduce it in canada without it costing them power.

&gt; as the imf’s [ian] parry observed, mr. trudeau managed to avoid the plight of other leaders who had to face defeat or back away from attempts to quickly and aggressively impose a carbon price – france’s emmanuel macron being offered as an example – by instead introducing it “in a progressive way over time.” although the initial price of $20 a tonne was not very impactful, it more easily earned some public buy-in, before subsequent increases that are now meant to have it go to $170 a tonne by 2030.
&gt;
&gt; the other aspect of mr. trudeau’s strategy that seems to draw international interest is the rebate system returning almost all revenue directly to taxpayers. ... it’s recognized as a possible solution for governments wary of being accused of a tax grab.

there's also talk of an international carbon price floor, and of carbon tariffs.

&gt; while mr. trudeau is trying to establish the 60-per-cent target, international bodies, including the imf and the organization for economic co-operation and development, are making their push around what [kristalina georgieva of the imf] called an “international carbon price floor.” the idea is that, to avoid prices being set too low to significantly reduce emissions, countries in a pact would have to agree to a minimum per-tonne price, with some differentiation based on those countries’ level of development.

&gt; ... if carbon pricing becomes more of a hot topic over the remainder of cop26, it may have more to do with the looming spectre of jurisdictions that price carbon penalizing those that don’t with tariffs known as carbon border adjustments – a model that the european union is already moving toward and canada, among others, is considering.
&gt;

if it's one tax per nation, it doesn't work, because the numbers don't align in developing nations. they would not collect enough money from the global aristocracy to pay enough to the poorest citizens for them to retain the ability to get to work or to market. with a nation-by-nation carbon tax, those bottom 3.5 billion would have to stop making any altogether, and the 1% would change nothing about their lifestyles.",liberals

agreed. and before anyone replies to point out how much empty housing there is in canada: we have a shortage of *accessible* and *affordable* inventory. it doesn't matter how many luxury condos get built and sit empty if none of them are ever available at reasonable rents, nor how many skinny infills if none are sold for less than $1m.

the government building affordable housing is long-overdue. it will of course provide affordable housing to people who need it. but if done at an adequate scale, it could also put some downward pressure on rents, and even as a consequence help ease the price of real estate.

the current government's housing strategy is a good but marginal initiative. the feds have been checked out of building housing for almost 3 decades, and the liberals have only just dipped their toes back in the water.",liberals

edit: i don't even necessarily fully agree, but it's definitely within the realm of good discourse and shouldn't be downvoted.

on the subject at hand i don't fully agree since if taken to this other extreme that would then just give opposition strategic control over when to have an election instead. and the prime minister requesting an election can be good in some circumstances and situations. though i do agree that this current parliament is working fine and should continue during the crisis we're in and in general that minority governments are healthy.

i'm very sympathetic though to the idea that it is indeed bullshit in this circumstance to commandeer the attention of society and put it towards an election for no real reason but to acquire more political power for yourself. we're still in and coming out of a major crisis and do we need to divert our country towards electoral politics right now? and on a human level, it would be nice for the people of canada to have a break and time to rest without diving into this often negative and dispiriting or overwhelming election cycle mode.",liberals

the problem with shifting more power to the west is that it’s a red herring of a solution. sure we have equal provincial representation, but we then in turn devalue the votes of a majority of the country in the more populated provinces. if you look at the seat count of bc, alberta, saskatchewan, and manitoba the percentage of seats they hold is almost equal to the percentage of canada’s gdp they contribute. but across those provinces alberta is actually 60% of the four’s output. people who want more seats in the west are  arguing that we deserve more seats purely because we are a province and that’s it, imo.

i’d also be careful arguing the conservatives are more liberal simply due to less strict party discipline. it is arguably what has been hurting their electoral success because it is resulting in people feeling confident to share their social regressive views under the label of “social conservatism”. it also is allowing their health critic during a pandemic to say we will be vaccinated in 2030 by doing curiously simple math with some vaccination rates.",conservatives

there are non-catholic countries with similar laws. it hurts when you do it, but it heals with time and then our society keeps steaming in the same direction. religions should adapt and become more discreet, be less restrictive especially towards women. religions that stay too conservative, just like the catholic church before, leads people to just abandon it at some point. this is why protestantism didn’t get dropped as hard as catholicism in the last century. the religion was more modern, priest being able to mary, no ties to the pope, etc.

you see it as the law targeting minority religions because they are the ones arboring symbols, i see it as those religions needing to adapt their practices to our society. for me, the religions are sexists and restrictive and it is up to the people inside these communities to adapt.

and it does nothing to prevent religious people from doing those jobs, you are right and that is the point. if you can make a compromise to keep your job, i think you will fit in nicely in our society and you are welcommed. if you can’t, still welcommed but know you will not be in a position of authority in the state.",liberals

you are half right: some people will not change their behaviour, especially if the carbon tax is small. but of course the amount of people that will depends on the amount of the tax, right?

you're also right that governments should fund things like public transportation.

and you're right again that we all need to keep our eyes open to make sure that low income people are not put in a tough position.

i'd go further than you here and even say that if poorer people have to bear any kind of burden here, it will be more difficult politically to have a carbon tax.

the good news is that a system can actually help poorer people out as long as the taxes taken in are paid out equally. now its certainly possible that a low income person with a poorly insulated house and a big commute could end up paying more than whatever is paid out; we should keep our eyes open in case that happens and the system can be adjusted. eg. you could lower taxes or do a nit.

anyway i think the important question(s) for you is: don't you think the amount of people that switch to low carbon alternatives depends on the size of the tax?

like small tax = small effect; big tax = big effect, right?

and if that's the case, what do you think would happen to us emissions at a carbon price of $200?

personally i would expect emissions to start to noticeably go down.  after a year or two you can re-evaluate performance, make sure low income people are taken care of etc. and potentially raise or lower the tax.",liberals

having said that, the effect of the ppc will be to drive the party closer towards the center. or at least about the same as o'toole was.  o'toole would likely  have won a clear victory if he hadn't screwed up the gun issue in the way he did. not only did it piss off gun owners (never a good idea) but it sent the clear message to everyone else that his word can't be trusted. and trust is a major thing the cpc has to build.  other than that - he was polling very well till then. 

so people won't look at the idea of being more centrist as a negative, and they will say that there's only so many votes to be taken back from the fringe so.. why not just move an inch closer to the center and pick up all those wonderful centrist votes around the 905? why are we trying to woo back anti vaxxers in alberta where we already have a commanding lead?

sorry - but really it would take the collapse of the ppc to move the cpc to the right - the more they're in existence the more the cpc is likely to move left to wards the center.",conservatives

funny how that works.

what is clear here is that the racism pretext is a talking point for the criminal regime in beijing and it is a talking point for the bare-faced racists telling this senator ‘to go back to china.’

making racist statements like this only drives more support for the criminal regime in beijing. besides, taiwan may be invaded in the relatively near future and as such, racism should play no part in assisting taiwan either.

however, it is clear that there are some in canada’s political and corporate classes who are sympathetic at best and at worst, outright supporters of the criminal regime in beijing. many names are already known.

who? that's a story that needs more information!

&gt; for as long as i’ve been working on this issue, canada has never had a distinct federal minister of housing — that is, until last week, when prime minister trudeau named ahmed hussen minister of housing and diversity and inclusion.

the problem is in the title: two enormous concerns under one minister means one or neither will receive adequate attention.

&gt; ironically, minister hussen immigrated to canada in 1993, the same year that chrétien’s liberal government cancelled spending on social housing and downloaded responsibility for existing and new housing to the provinces.

&gt; within five years the country faced a tragic social welfare disaster that included enormous housing wait lists and mass homelessness. in response, the toronto disaster relief committee formed in 1998 and issued a state of emergency declaration naming homelessness a national disaster. 

it's amazing, and terrible, that this is largely missing from the public consciousness. it deserves to be an embarrassing scandal that dogs the grits to this day.

this is the root of our housing crisis.

&gt; we will truly have a minister of housing if the minister’s mandate letter includes funding for social housing and rent-geared-to-income housing, creating a co-op housing stream, providing rehabilitation funds for old housing stock, ensuring that seniors’ pensions are increased so they can afford to stay in their homes, and creating long-term care standards so our seniors can be housed safely in their later years, and the same for home care.

save for seniors pensions and home care, the rest could be spearheaded by any level of government.

85 - aboriginal peoples television network to support reconciliation

88 - continued support for the north american indigenous games

94 - replace the oath of citizenship

13 - acknowledge that aboriginal rights include aboriginal language rights

15 - appoint an aboriginal languages commissioner

16 - create university and college degree and diploma programs in aboriginal languages

39 - collect and publish data on the criminal victimization of aboriginal people

41 - appoint a public inquiry into the causes of, and remedies for, the disproportionate victimization of aboriginal women and girls

59 - church parties to residential school settlement to educate congregations on why apologies necessary

70 - a national review of archival policies

80 - establish a national day for truth and reconciliation as a statutory holiday

83 - canada council for the arts to establish a strategy for indigenous and non-indigenous artists to undertake collaborative projects

84 - restore and increase funding to the cbc/radio-canada to enable it to support reconciliation

and by my analysis, the only ones trudeau had a direct hand in are: 88, 94, 13, 41+, 59++, 70, 80, 84+++.

+action 41 was an inquiry that has issued 231 recommendations, and..

&gt;the inquiry also cannot compel governments or agencies to implement its recommendations.

++action 59, i would argue, did not get \"completed\" as the catholic church has not followed through on recommendations.

+++action 84 was completed in fiduciary terms, but i am not a regular viewer of cbc, and am curious as to how much...
&gt;all broadcasters in canada have a responsibility under the broadcasting act to recognize in their programming the “special place of aboriginal peoples.”

also - the rebuttal to your vaccine comments is that no, there is no link between the adverse reactions and vaccines. some reactions sure, but its factually incorrect to assert the claim that they are more dangerous than the disease they protect against. they are safe and effective and asserting they are not is misinformation. comments like this make biologists eye roll in the same way a flat earthers comments make a physicist face-palm. until you clean your brain of this conspiratorial-thinking you're always going to think its all one big conspiracy when in reality - the universe is full of random events and chaos. i know its scary, but a scary truth is much better than living a comfortable (yet angry) lie.",conservatives

there is so much that is non-ideal with the quebec pharmacare system, but the government holds it dearly, and any attempt to replace it with a universal plan similar to cha will face a great deal of resistance from the provincial government. i would not be surprised if every other province implements truly universal pharmacare and quebec remains the only one with a patchy public-private plan.

where they are effective is to force the government to take a position on the issue or to stimulate debate or in this case point out their lack of action. it did a very good job at generating public support on this issue and awareness that this program which has been promised by liberals for decades has nothing to show for it still. the bill itself was pretty reasonably made and set up a framework that allowed for negotiation with provinces and criteria similar to the canada health act that they’d like to see in a pharmacare program.

another thing to be aware of is opposition legislation has a small team of legislative drafters that they go to for putting things together, whereas the government has the justice department to draft, plus the entire public service at their disposal to help craft policy at greater granularity. i think people need to manage expectations on what they should expect from opposition bills. if the government was intent on working with opposition on these issues they’d find ways to support them with the resources they have, or at least bring the bill to committee to have more study and debate on the merits of proposals in the bill, but it would be naive to expect the government to want to play along with everyone. instead the oppositions job is to introduce points of pressure to move things along or provide legislative building blocks that can be considered and expanded upon. it also shows that the pandemic hasn’t stopped the ndp from trying to move things forward and throws the ball in the government’s court to say “ok well show us your homework if you’ve been working on it and tell us how your going to do it?”",liberals

national interest rate for inflation and could add or deduct to cool   
regional hot spots

i think that would be very very tricky. remember - the boc isn't giving mortgages - their customers are the banks. and the banks aren't really regional - once you give the 'td' money they can loan it out anywhere they want. 

also - interest rates really dont' \"cool\" markets that much. they don't affect those who already have cash for example and they just tend to lower the cost of homes by exactly as much as they raise the cost of interest - so they're no more affordable. and they tend to discourage development as developers have to make higher interest payments until their product sells, so they build a little less, and that means less product. also - people are less likely to sell and will hold on to their properties longer and that reduces product which tends to put upward pressure on markets. 

it's just not an effective tool, and it would be very hard for the feds to use. 

it we wanted to do more along the lines of what you're thinking, the cmhc would likely be a better choice. change the requirement to require cmhc insurance on all purchases with less than 50 percent down, (or more, maybe even 75percent) and then charge higher premiums in 'red hot' areas to drive the costs up and discourage investment buying in those specific areas. 

that would have the effect you were looking for - and it would raise a lot of money for the cmhc which means if there's a sudden crash and lots of defaults then the banks are protected against a financial catastrophe (which prevents the kind of economic collapse we saw in the states during the great bubble burst) and you could still do a \"special discount\" for first time buyers to help make it more affordable for them compared to others.

to say both telford and butts are “amateurs” and using lacklustre supporting points is funny.

telford is by far one of the smartest women in politics in canada today. she was key in re-inventing the liberal party and eventually bringing them and trudeau to a historical electoral victory in 2015.

no, all that was struck down were the mandatory minimum for unauthorized possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm with ammunition. *nur* has no impact on the mandatory minimums for \"use\" offences.

&gt;as the firearms act is written so poorly, and the laws so unclear, that the scc thought the application of mandatory minimums for breaking them constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

this is mostly incorrect, as well as a non-sequitur.

the relevant offences are set out in the *criminal code,* not the *firearms act*, and there's nothing \"unclear\" about the mandatory minimums, or more generally the language of s. 95, that the supreme court dealt with in *nur*. that wasn't the issue before the court at all.

the issue was whether the mandatory minimum sentences for unauthorized possession of a firearm would, as applied to a reasonable hypothetical situation (there was no doubt that as applied to mssrs. charles and nur, the mandatory sentences would have be proportionate and reasonable) be grossly disproportionate to a reasonable sentence, and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment. specifically:

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;\\[78\\]                          nur does not argue that the mandatory minimum in s. 95(2)(a)(i) results in a grossly disproportionate sentence in his case.  rather, he argues it violates s. 12 in its reasonably foreseeable application to some other offenders. the question is whether the three-year minimum sentence imposed by s. 95(2)(a)(i) will result in grossly disproportionate sentences in reasonably foreseeable cases.  
&gt;  
&gt;\\[79\\]                          i would answer this question in the affirmative.  the court of appeal, using the language of “reasonable hypotheticals”, described **a situation at the licensing end of the spectrum of conduct caught by s. 95(1) for which a three-year sentence would be grossly disproportionate — where a person who has a valid licence for an unloaded restricted firearm at one residence, safely stores it with ammunition in another residence, e.g. at her cottage rather than her dwelling house**

and:

&gt;\\[82\\]                          section 95(1) casts its net over a wide range of potential conduct.  most cases within the range may well merit a sentence of three years or more, but conduct at the far end of the range may not.  at one end of the range, as doherty j.a. observed, “stands the outlaw who carries a loaded prohibited or restricted firearm in public places as a tool of his or her criminal trade. . . . \\[t\\]his person is engaged in truly criminal conduct and poses a real and immediate danger to the public”: para. 51.  at this end of the range — indeed for the vast majority of offences — a three-year sentence may be appropriate.  a little further along the spectrum stands the person whose conduct is less serious and poses less danger; for these offenders three years’ imprisonment may be disproportionate, but not grossly so. **at the far end of the range, stands the licensed and responsible gun owner who stores his unloaded firearm safely with ammunition nearby, but makes a mistake as to where it can be stored.  for this offender, a three-year sentence is grossly disproportionate to the sentence the conduct would otherwise merit under the sentencing provisions of the criminal code.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\\[83\\]                          **given the minimal blameworthiness of the offender in this situation and the absence of any harm or real risk of harm flowing from the conduct (i.e. having the gun in one residence as opposed to another), a three-year sentence would be grossly disproportionate**.  similar examples can be envisaged.  **a person inherits a firearm and before she can apprise herself of the licence requirements commits an offence.  a spouse finds herself in possession of her husband’s firearm and breaches the regulation.  we need not focus on a particular hypothetical.  the bottom line is that s. 95(1) foreseeably catches licensing offences which involve little or no moral fault and little or no danger to the public.  for these offences three years’ imprisonment is grossly disproportionate to a fit and fair sentence.**  firearms are inherently dangerous and the state is entitled to use sanctions to signal its disapproval of careless practices and to discourage gun owners from making mistakes, to be sure.  but a three-year term of imprisonment for a person who has essentially committed a licensing infraction is totally out of sync with the norms of criminal sentencing set out in the s. 718 of the criminal code and legitimate expectations in a free and democratic society.  as the court of appeal concluded, there exists a “cavernous disconnect” between the severity of the licensing-type offence and the mandatory minimum three-year term of imprisonment: para. 176.  consequently, i conclude that s. 95(2)(a)(i) breaches s. 12 of the charter.

and:

&gt;\\[103\\]                      i agree that the court of appeal erred in concluding that it was reasonably foreseeable that a repeat offender could be a licensed owner of a prohibited or restricted firearm.  this does not end the analysis, however.  the court must test the reasonably foreseeable applications of s. 95(2)(a)(ii).  **under the impugned mandatory minimum, a five-year term of imprisonment could be imposed on an individual who breached a prohibition order imposed while on bail and who, some years later, innocently came into possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm without an authorization or a licence together with usable ammunition that he stored nearby and which was readily accessible.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**\\[104\\]                      a five-year minimum term of imprisonment for offenders such as these would be draconian.** it goes far beyond what is necessary in order to protect the public, far beyond what is necessary to express moral condemnation of the offender, and far beyond what is necessary to discourage others from engaging in such conduct. in a phrase, such a sentence would be grossly disproportionate. an offender in these circumstances has not caused any harm, nor is there a real risk of harm to the public. such an offender is not engaged in any criminal activity.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;in my view the law is correctly stated in the following passage in the judgment of o’halloran j.a., with whom robertson j.a. concurred, in rex v. hess: to constitute “possession” within the meaning of the criminal law it is my judgment that where, as here, there is manual handling of a thing, it must be co-existent with knowledge of what the thing is, **and both these elements must be co-existent with some act of control (outside public duty).** when those three elements exist together, i think it must be conceded that under sec. 4(1)(d) it does not then matter if the thing is retained for an innocent purpose.

 (emphasis added)

and see *r v loukas,* 2006 oncj 219 (canlii) at para 12: 

&gt;the notion of “public duty” is somewhat ambiguous.  at narrowest, it suggests that the exemption (if such it is) from criminal liability applies only to those, such as the police and court officers, who are required to occasionally possess legally prohibited items in the execution of their professional responsibilities.  however, the facts in hess suggest a broader application.  as explained by the ontario court of appeal in r. v. ormerod, \\[1969\\] 4 ccc 2, at 16: **“the concept of ‘public duty’ in the hess case … relates to the handling of things only for the purpose of turning them over to the police, and not with even any momentary intention of keeping or using them”.**  subsequent jurisprudence has further enlarged the compass of this defence to include, at its most expansive, those situations where control over the unlawful goods is exercised solely for a worthy public purpose and without any intention of keeping, using or otherwise personally benefiting from the property.  **in these circumstances, and consistent with the values enshrined in s. 7 of the charter, the law is not prepared to infer a criminally blameworthy state of mind or, put otherwise, to punish the “morally innocent”.**

for some forms of crime punishment as part of the equation is in fact part of the goal of the sentence.

for certain kinds of crime - especially \"victimless\" crimes wherein the person committing the crime is only harming themselves (like drug addictions) it's especially harmful to have mandatory minimums. for others related to broader systemic issues like poverty they're also much more harmful.

for things like murder, sexual assault, and violent acts, the mandatory minimum being bad is something balanced against the society seeking punishment not just reform.

i personally think that prison is a bad thing, i'm probably a bit abolitionist in that sense - short of a handful of very serious crimes reform and rehabilitation should be the core goals as most crime is smaller in nature and if addressed early effectively means we have less serious crimes down the road. but that doesn't change the fact that the system we have now doesn't have the same boundaries for punishment vs rehabilitation as i do perhaps.",liberals

let's say we were to introduce a silly law banning pork.  would you also consider it to be discriminatory because it doesn't affect muslim or jews as much as christians and sikh? based on the idea that pork isn't halal nor kosher so muslims and jews don't eat pork.

apparently condemning all religious violence is a bad thing. so the libs kept it as is and the cpc voted against it because it was decisive and unclear and not inclusive. 

in ford's case - a few days ago an opposition member stood up and demanded to make a similar motion. the pc legitimately said you can't spring that on us at the last second, put it in writing so we all can look at it and discuss it and we'll vote on it then. the opposition demanded an immediate vote, no review, and it got shot down. as anything should have been in those circumstances, if you actually care about the motion you circulate it first as always.

&gt;since when was skin colour a choice?  religion is not race.  theist clothing choice is not skin colour.  your attempt to conflate race and religion in order to portray theist clothing as being as inherent to a person as their skin, is widely inappropriate.

the religions most affected are disproportionately practiced by minorities. it’s a legal motion that will hardly affect white individuals while greatly affecting minorities, ergo, the bill is racist.

&gt;name a single reason why theists, and only theists, should get exemptions to this law.

because it’s a law that only affects religious individuals?

&gt;if it's not special treatment for theists, tell me why only theists get the exemption.  simple question.

you can’t conflate political advocacy with religious beliefs, the reason why government officials in positions of authority can’t wear political garb is because they have to represent neutrality. people facing arrest and/or trial have a right to fair treatment, political garb brings into question the neutrality of the officer/judge since it demonstrates clear advocacy for a set of beliefs that may influence their decision. most branches of government are required to be non-partisan (elections canada, the privy council, and the justice department.) as to represent the rights of everyone not just the people who voted for the party who won.

as someone in the 905, my impression was that the local candidates this past election were a very unimpressive bunch. i know my riding (which is a winnable riding for the cpc, and one they'd need to ever get a majority), had someone without anything impressive on their resume, and no local history or prominence.

it won't be enough to win these seats on their own, but, it probably closes a lot of gaps in tighter ridings.",conservatives
