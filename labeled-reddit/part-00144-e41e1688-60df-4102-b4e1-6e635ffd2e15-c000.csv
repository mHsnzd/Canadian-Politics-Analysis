gzzxgy8,2021-05-30T04:12:51.000-07:00,"opinion: the term ‘bipoc’ is a bad fit for the canadian discourse on race &gt; why are we still talking about that? he wasn't.

i wasn't referring to trudeau specifically. 

&gt; he didn't grow up as one. 

he did his high school studies in french, and his dad made the whole family speak french in certain areas at home, notably at the kitchen table. that doesn't give justin any \"merit\" whatsoever, but he still spent a good portion of of his years growing up by speaking french.

&gt; he didn't grow up as one. he didn't experience living as a minority language speaker in canada because he is perfectly happy to switch to his mother tongue when the situation requires.

which is applicable to a large amount of francophones too. many have been and still are more than happy to switch to english.

&gt; when he gets tired, it's french he loses, not english.

a problem that encountered by many francophones outside quebec. if you know that much about trudeau's struggles in french, than you know about the original context in which this was published, which was about insecure francophones struggling with their mother tongue in anglophone pockets. 

&gt; the framing of him as a francophone by federalists and canadians is a clumsy attempt to cheapen and demean what it means to be a francophone in canada.

\"what it means to be francophone\" has become an increasingly more vague aspect. because the english-centric oppression has gotten significantly weaker in the past decades with the quiet revolution and bill 101, as francophones get jobs, climb the corporate ladder, etc., experiences of francophones are less and less coherent with each other. 

&gt; when i start using english regularly, i start to be able to pass as a native anglophone yet i am not. like trudeau in french i have little buy in into that culture. i'm currently learning a third language and while it will be a rewarding experience i won't be anywhere near able to understand the native experience and it would be insulting to natives to pretend i do.

if you speak english outside of your personal life, and french otherwise, then it would be weird to call yourself an anglophone. it's a much harder call to make when languages are intertwined in your personal life, however, which is the case of many second-generation immigrants, francophones outside quebec and families like trudeau's.",liberals

i'm not downplaying what happened with the residential schools and i'm open to further investigation. but trying to correct a historical wrong through acts of violence is never ok, and it will only lead to more violence in the future. so its incredibly disappointing to see our leaders remain largely silent on this, because they view it as politically beneficial.",conservatives

second, that only means that s. 251(4) engaged the right to liberty - as does *every* law the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. that doesn't mean it's unconstitutional - a law which infringes on the right to liberty only violates s.7 if it does so in a manner that violates a principle of fundamental justice. 

per your other comment-

&gt;the court ruled that a ban on abortion was unconstitutional because such a law violates the security of person section of the charter of rights and freedoms. 

the court did not rule that \"a ban on abortion was unconstitutional\" because the court was not considering a law which banned abortion. the court was considering a law which required that certain types of abortions be approved by a particular process ('therapeutic abortion committees'). maybe read the case yourself before you go around lecturing other people about not having read it.

more like: a big chunk (maybe even the majority) of his party's supporters think the current system is terrible (and many of them don't understand it very well), so erin has to propose something else to avoid pissing off his own base. that's why he's proposing keeping the less visible parts of the carbon price (e.g. penalties for big industrial emitters) in place while neutering the consumer carbon tax ... but i think he's hoping that the frankenstein of a rewards points system will trick some less-informed people into polluting less anyways, because they're not aware that they get more back if they buy more fossil fuels, so it still has some effect.",conservatives

i am pleased that despite the vaccine escape (30% against infection vs 89% before for double vaccinated) the protection against high severity of omicron is a little more durable (70% vs 90% in delta).

there is another study indicating that omicron is very efficient at replicating in the bronchus (70x better) but less so in the lungs (10x worse), which would have impact on severity as well... one of the major causes of covid severity being it fucking up your lungs:

true, but also irrelevant because of how the *constitution act, 1982* defines the constitution of canada.

the *constitution act, 1867* is - in its entirety - part of the constitution of canada (note the big c - it's a formal term), as defined in section 52(2) of the ca 1982 and listed in the schedule to the ca 1982.

the ca 1982 provides for the constitution of canada to be amended through the general procedure (section 38), the unanimous procedure (section 41), the unilateral federal procedure (section 44), and the bilateral/multilateral procedure (section 43).

the ca 1982 does **not** provide for unilateral (i.e. with no involvement of the federal parliament) amendments to the constitution of canada by the provinces. section 45 says provinces can make laws amending the constitution (note the small c - a general term) of the province - it does not use the formal term \"constitution of canada\" utilized in sections 38, 41, 43 and 44.

some provinces do have specific \"constitutional\" acts (e.g. bc has its own 1996 constitution act). provincial constitutions in most cases are just ordinary statutes that rise to constitutional status (you could argue the charter of the french language is part of quebec's constitution, for instance). nobody disputes that provinces have the right to unilaterally amend these. if quebec wants to pass a law declaring that quebecers form a nation and that french is their common language, it has that right.

**however,** any alteration to the text of the ca 1867 is *explicitly* an amendment to the constitution of canada as defined in section 52 of the ca 1982. and in this the ca 1982 couldn't be any clearer:

\"an amendment to the constitution of canada **in relation to any provision** **that applies to one or more, but not all provinces** . . . may be made by proclamation issued by the governor general under the great seal of canada **only where so authorized by resolutions of the senate and house of commons** and of the legislative assembly of each province to which the amendment applies.\"

and as if that isn't clear enough, section 43 goes further so as to single out amendments *to any provision relating to the use of english or french within a province.*

there is simply no sane reading of our constitution where one can conclude that quebec can change the 1867 act unilaterally as bill 96 is purporting to do. bill 96 attempts to change the constitution of canada unilaterally.",liberals

gynympc,2021-05-18T15:57:45.000-07:00,"quebec can modify part of the canadian constitution unilaterally, trudeau says there are already some supreme court priors on this - for instance, the scc has previously told quebec that it can’t unilaterally legislate changes to the application of s.133 of the ca 1867 (which protects english and french in legislatures and court proceedings).

as for who would bring this to court, it largely depends on what happens after bill 96 passes.

if bill 96 passes, the federal gov’t could simply table motions in both the house and senate approving the changes to the ca 1867. there’s no requirement that the provincial legislation needs to specify this step or anything. if both houses approve it, then there’s no issue, no obstacle, no need to go to court - at least not over the language thing. that said, the it’s possible other provinces will feel the declaration of nationhood alters quebec’s position in the federation in a way which is disadvantageous to other provinces. they might challenge it in court arguing that the general procedure is required. in this scenario, that’s the mostly likely challenge.

scenario 2: bill 96 passes and ottawa does nothing. since the feds don’t do anything, the statutes of canada (which include statutes such as the ca 1867 which belong to the constitution of canada) never get updated, so bill 96’s changes to the ca 1867 don’t get implemented - they exist in quebec law, but not the constitution of canada. in this scenario, the court challenge would have to come from quebec, demanding that their amendments be recognized as valid and implemented.

scenario 3: bill 96 passes and ottawa quietly amends the ca 1867 without asking parliament. in this case, we’ll probably see some sort of public interest challenge from the rest of canada - probably some random lawyer with a bone to pick. however, provinces will likely get involved as intervenors, since they’ll likely want to get some clarity on what powers *they* might have to make their own unilateral changes to the constitution of canada.",liberals

[last year](https://www.ft.com/content/0e26b798-3848-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4), the german government reached a historic deal to shut down germany's coal plants by 2038. that actually understates things a bit: in 2019 germany had around 44gw of coal (about half lignite, half hard coal). by the end of 2022, that is scheduled to be 30gw and by 2030 it will be 17gw. so this is hard pace (canada had about 10gw of coal in 2016 for comparison). germany plans to meet 65% of it's electricity needs with renewables by 2030 (43% today), an astonishing target.

however, a new climate law accelerates the deal further. germany will now aim to be carbon neutral by 2045 rather than 2050 and will reduce its emissions by 65% below 1990 levels (previous 55%) by 2030. for comparison, canada's target is 16% below 1990 levels (currently 21% *above* 1990 levels).

the law was in response to a ruling by germany's supreme court which found that the current laws left too much to fugure generations. the judge [found](https://www.ft.com/content/75956e41-57b1-4c55-981e-aec7a21560a0) that the current law put off much the emissions reductions until after 2030. this will mean moving forward the coal shutdown *substantially*.

we are seeing fantastic progress in both emissions targets and action from countries like the [uk](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadapolitics/comments/mv6esg/us_and_them_april_21_2021/gvc5nno?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and germany (both led by conservatives, incidently). the high use of renewables in both countries irrefutably demonstrates that current technology is capable of scaling up and this transition is economically feasible. what is requires is the political will.",conservatives

of course the french can eat fine without gmos, france is a very rich country,and can be wasteful.   just like the americans can convert farmland to produce lower quality, more polluting gas - they can afford it, but it's bad for the environment, bad for sustainability.

and mandatory gmo labelling is openly dog-whistling to imply it's not safe (which you can say directly because it's not true). if it was really \"choice\" or \"information\" you could use gmo-free type labels.

it's fundamentally the same anti-fact, anti-science attitude, though the particular facts people object to depends on their ideology, of course. 

but i have to be wary of anyone who is hostile to facts and science, whether from the right, left, or whatever.  it's unpredictable, and can be dangerous, even if some things sound innocuous.

business start because people can see a need and see a way to meet it and potentially make money. having less taxes can help the math but by itself it doesn't prompt it. a lot of high tax regions just have a reactor of just the right things to keep businesses popping up despite the taxes. the silicon valleys or new york businesses.

what are people's predictions for what 2-3 ministers get dumped completely?

my picks would be blair, bennett and mendicino.  blair is a disaster and bad look, and being a white male from the gta makes him a complete waste of a cabinet seat.  i can't see how trudeau can leave carolyn bennett in cabinet after her jwr gaffe, especially after the tofino-fiasco has increased scrutiny on that.  she needs to be put out to pasture.  i would dump saijjan as the 3rd, but it sounds like he's getting another portfolio, so i would go with mendicino.  he mishandled the afghanistan response, and they need to again dump white men from the gta to open up spots to meet gender parity.",liberals
