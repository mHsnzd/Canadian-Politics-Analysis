edit.

&gt; the poll by insights west released tuesday was conducted last month and involved about 1,000 canadians. it suggests a high level of satisfaction, if not enthusiasm, with the current first-past-the-post (fptp) electoral system. fully 62 per cent of respondents said they were very or somewhat satisfied with the system as it stands, with 19 per cent saying they were \"very satisfied.\" only 25 per cent said they were dissatisfied with fptp.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-electoral-reform-referendum-1.3439979

&gt; but if the liberals will have an obstacle to overcome in pushing that change, it may be indifference — 32 per cent of canadians said they had no clear view on the issue and, given the choice, a clear majority said that the current first-past-the-post system was their first or second preference.

gwg9vkw,2021-04-30T03:58:46.000-07:00,"the last thing lgbtq2 canadians need is mps misquoting scripture at them &gt;christianity is thoroughly authoritarian because it demands unquestioning obedience to an infallible deity. when a \"recommendation\" is backed by threats of death and eternal torture, we normally recognize that it is coercive and compliance is under duress.

would you consider telling someone **\" hey you shouldn't steal, cause if you do, you will go to prison\"** an authoritarian statement?

&gt;in any event, when you have to bring in the language of \"submission\" to leaders you are most definitely in an authoritarian system. big brother loves you (because you obey him)!

that's actually the opposite. god loves you through it all. **\"but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, christ died for us.\" - romans 5:8**

we love god through obeying him. if a parent loves his child, even when that child is being unloving to the parent, and people around him. if the parent's love makes the child to love the parent back. how do you expect the child would return his love to the parent? he could talk to the parent, tell them that he loves the parent \"dad i love you\" or the kid could go even further and act in a good way, making the father happy because the kid is becoming a better person.

\\-------------------------------------

&gt;by all means teach children empathy. but it is wrong, morally and ethically, for parents to indoctrinate their children and *make them* follow their beliefs. how dare you. how dare you treat children with their vulnerable, developing minds as a prospective recruits and play on their compulsion to seek the approval of their parents. you do not own them.

&amp;#x200b;

empathy is an action, that comes from a moral framework that says \"caring for other people by making them feel good is a good thing\". now that is one ideology you can teach. but that is an ideology\\*([*ideology*](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ideology): a form of social or political philosophy in which practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones. it is a system of ideas that aspires both to explain the world and to change it.)\\*

a parent can also go to other ways of thinking, egoism(some forms of egoism) for example. parents can teach kids to act in their own self-interests. only being kind if that is advantageous to them, and only being rude if it is advantageous to them. rather than working through a set of objective morals, the individual(kid) works in a system that benefits them the most.

just as different parents teach different ideologies to their kids as they grow up. christian parents do.

if someone is an atheist, and their child asks them \"is god real\" and the parent says \"no son. god is a myth, made by dumb people so they can feel better, and oppress people. will you tell them also **\"how dare you\"?**

if some parent teaches their kid, ideas relating to gender theory at a young age will you tell them also **\"how dare you\"?**

if a parent tells their kid, \"trump is the best president\" will you tell them **\"how dare you\"?**

if a parent says to their children \"people who are conservatives are bad people, they want to destroy the world\" will you tell them **\"how dare you\"?**

or are you just acting maliciously to a specific ideology which is christian beliefs?

&gt;if your religion is so compelling, why not persuade adults rather than easy marks? an adult, especially a parent can convince a child nearly anything is true.

i do try to persuade adults, christians try to persuade more adults than children. but it is better to take kids on the right path than just let them be doing whatever they want. any decent parent will always teach their kid what they think is the best ideology, the best way to look at the world in order to help the child become the best they can be.

children believe nearly everything, do you support schools teaching kids left-wing values and outlooks to the world like they do in b.c? or is this just a specific standard you have for christian parents teaching their kids christian values?

&gt;jesus himself fucking said, \"let the little children come unto me\"; you don't have to force them. if your religion is real they will be drawn to him, o ye of little faith.

1. everyone forces their kid to do and believe in good things. when the kid grows up, then they can do whatever the heck they want. but they learn from their parents when they are a child.
2. please read the whole thing before posting

***13*** *people were bringing little children to jesus for him to place his hands on them,* ***but the disciples rebuked them.*** ***14*** ***when jesus saw this, he was indignant.*** *he said to them,* ***“let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these.*** ***15*** *truly i tell you,* ***anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it.****”* ***16*** *and he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.  - mark 10:13-*

so the context is the disciples try to stop the kids from coming to jesus, when they do jesus gets mad at them. like bruh, jesus isn't out here telling parents to just not teach their kids the gospel, rather he is rebuking people who stop kids from hearing the gospel. you were the one trying to stop the little kids from learning about the gospel, not the parents lol. you got this verse mixed up my dude.",conservatives

these kind of things don't get sent in writing to leaders because it gives them plausible deniability. if there's a chance of blowback, there's absolutely no way it's going to be sent in an email to the leader. it goes to the leader's office and then conveyed to the leader via word of mouth.

however, once you've made the value judgement, the best way to achieve it is set out by a scientific assessment of risk and viral spread.  that's a task left to scientists who have already laid out a framework.  o'toole is interfering with this framework because he finds the people it would protect morally objectionable, even though in doing so he's undermining the values he says he supports.

it's no different than conservatives claiming to want to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sti's but refusing to support a comprehensive sex ed curriculum and pushing abstinence only, when the evidence is very clear that that doesn't work and actively defeats the purpose of preventing unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sti's.  this isn't just a matter of opinion, it's not a relativist wasteland; we have objective evidence of harm.  

you can't claim to have a particular value judgment that requires you to rely on scientists to achieve what you say you want to achieve, then turn around and interfere with these scientists' efforts because you have particular moral scruples.  it's like people who go to a doctor to find out why they're having chest pains, but then start arguing with the physician when she tells them to lose weight and stop smoking.  that's modern conservatism in a nutshell - arguing out of both sides of your mouth.",conservatives

- incentives to distribute high volumes of newcomers across the country where population is low and housing supply is high. 

i don’t think we do any of the above particularly well.   rather, i think much of the target is based on corporate lobbyists who want larger pools of labour supply and people to sell mortgages and cars to.  there’s a reason the major parties were asked by big business to not make immigration an election issue in 2019.

&gt; mr. bernier’s reputation as a gadfly was once earned **not by pandering to crypto-racists and fringe kooks, but by his willingness to say the sorts of things that are trite among economists but utterly alien to the world of politics**: on supply management, on business subsidies, on the many ways in which current policy exploits the taxpayer and despoils the consumer.

&gt; his departure for loonier pastures, coupled with erin o’toole’s puréeing of conservative party policy into a platform any liberal could love, leaves limited-government conservatives without a home.

did this bernier ever actually exist?

i agree it would be better if we had that bernier, i might even vote for him, and it would certainly be better for the country overall if that was the bernier we had. but you go to the polls with the bernier you have, not the bernier you might want or wish to have at a later time.

if they hit the numbers they're on track for in this election, i think they should be more or less guaranteed a spot in the next debates. while it does seem like \"one week after the writ\" is an unnecessarily harsh restriction designed to keep non-mainstream candidates out, it is what it is - maybe they can find some legal remedy. but having a legible, verifiable, reasonably objective set of rules is better than the \"andrew coyne vibe check\" test.

what i take issue with in particular, though, is this idea:

&gt; as a first rule when dealing with people who believe powerful people are meeting in secret to conspire against them, it is best if powerful people do not meet in secret to conspire against them.

this is exactly the sort of consideration that the leader's debates commission should steer clear of. their mandate does not, and must not, include engineering public opinion on how \"legitimate\" a party or belief is. they should not reject the ppc to avoid legitimizing them. the should not accept the ppc in order to legitimize them, nor should they accept the ppc in order to (on coyne's theory) deprive them of legitimacy. the thought should not cross their minds. they should remain focused solely on determining whether a candidate is mainstream enough to be included in the debates.",conservatives

i would hate to see a repeat of what happened with the \"green new deal\" down south: using climate change as a bludgeon for social engineering. conservatives already have a tough time signing on to initiatives tackling climate change, but if progressive organizations are going to make them first and foremost about social and racial justice it's going to be damn near impossible. the ndp is already going down this path and i fear the greens are going to tack the same way.

the problem with environmentalists (and i say so as one) is they're never holistic in their worldview. their environmentalism is not broad, it's narrow. by far the best thing that could happen for everybody on this earth is for emissions to be reduced as aggressively as possible. that has to be the goal, not making sure greenpeace has enough \"bipoc\" employees out protesting against nuclear plants.",conservatives

h9fzahy,2021-08-18T05:28:54.000-07:00,"erin o’toole’s child care plan gets failing grade from advocate &gt;“the main barrier to the challenges of recruiting and retaining are the very low wages paid to eces,” said ballantyne. “one of the main reasons the wages are so low is that we don’t have a publicly funded and managed system of early learning and childcare.”according to a study recently published by statistics canada, eces make an average annual income of $24,000, which is less than half the average annual income of workers in all other professions. ninety-five percent of eces are women.ballantyne said market-based approaches to childcare have meant that the working conditions and wages of eces are entirely dependent on the revenue received through fees paid by parents.“it pits those who are trying to provide the service against those who are desperately in need of the service,” she explained. “the only thing that will address these problems is publicly funding and building a system of early learning and childcare, and making it a government responsibility.”

this woman doesn't understand how markets work. there's nothing about the market based approach that pits parents and service providers against each other. the market-based approach works perfectly fine. if parents have more money to spend on daycare, it will raise the demand, which will raise the wages.

the advantage of the market based appraoch is that, by not fixing the price at an artificially low level, you avoid creating the shortage that will surely exist under the liberals' plan and which is a known problem in quebec, whose system they're copying.

she shouldn't be offering her opinion on whether the market based approach is good or bad if she doesn't even have a rudimentary understanding of economics.

&gt;“we know that the biggest gaps in labour force participation are between men and women,” ballantyne explained. “if you build a system of early learning and childcare, that in itself is a major job creator, and a stimulator of all kinds of economic benefits.”

this is what economists call [vulgar keynesianism](https://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/vulgar.html) and it is wrong.

it's good they later interview an economist in the article, but there are some problems there too.

&gt;“childcare fees are just too high in big cities for it to really lead to affordable outcomes in places like toronto, where the childcare fees for infants are closing in on $20,000 a year,” macdonald told the maple. “a $6,000 credit even at the maximum value does very little.”

well, no, it's $6,000. that's a lot.

&gt;“you can’t spend a third of your income on childcare in hopes you’ll get a credit back in three months or a year from now

why not? of course you can do that.

essentially, the only real point to be made here is that it's worse because they're spending less money. but it is undoubtedly the better approach. they could spend the same amount as the liberals and it would do far more good.

&gt;macdonald said the most reliable way to deliver affordable childcare is through capping fees at a certain level, and then creating direct transfers to providers, similar to the system in quebec.

that's just not true and would be surprised if you could find many other economists who would agree with this. the guy is from the canadian centre for policy alternatives, which is a left-wing activist organization, which might explain this heterodox opinion.

what he is suggesting is a price ceiling, which always lead to shortages, unless you can be sure that the subsidy is sufficient, but if it is, there's no reason for the price ceiling. there's a reason why economists are so strongly opposed to price controls.

there is no reason why the same affordability can't be provided by just giving money to parents. a subsidy is just an indirect transfer to the parents after all, except that it has to be spent on childcare, which is not a good thing, since it distorts the market.

&gt;however, macdonald added, “in the rollout of a plan like this it shouldn’t only be about reducing fees, but also about building spaces, so there are more spaces for that increased demand.”

again, this makes the same mistake as above. as an economist, he should know that increasing demand leads to more spaces being built. there is no reason that you would expect any difference in the number of spaces being built depending on whether you give the money to the parents or to the daycares. in fact, if the price ceiling he's advocating for is low enough to do anything, then you would expect fewer spaces to be built, not more, since the providers would have less money than before to build them.",liberals

from a right wing financial perspective, beefing up the ccb might have been the better option but that is reliant on people using money smartly. in theory ccb paying out $1200/month per kid tax free should pretty much already cover any child care costs but in practice it doesn't appear to pan out that way.",liberals

also, you have to take into a account sample size. the smaller the sample size, the greater the margin of error. margin of error in canadian polls  means that 95% (19/20) of your polls are going to fall within the margin if you take an infinite or very large number of polls.  the 5% you get outside the margin of error are called 'outliers'.

so if you look at wiki  a [composite poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_44th_canadian_federal_election) of the last 20 leger polls for the ndp, you get the followng distribution for the ndp

17  |

18  |||||

19  |||

20  |||||

21  ||

22  ||

23  ||

median = 20

mean = 19.8

this tells you that the 20% the ndp got this month is dead on average for leger for the last year or so, and indicates that ndp numbers continue to be  flat in terms of any discernable trend. this leger poll has a sample size of \\~1500 and a margin of error +/-2.5  (round that to +/-3), so you'd need an ndp value to go to 24 or 16 to be an outlier for leger.

now, if you consider that ontario is about 1/3 of canada, you are talking a sample size of 500. typically, a poll of that size has a margin of about +/-4.5. that would be even higher for the other regions. so the distribution that you see above would spread over a range of about 11 numbers  instead of 7 for ontario. you have a much larger margin of error in regional polls.

that being said, if you compare past leger polls to other polls on [a composite poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_44th_canadian_federal_election), leger does poll the ndp high at the expense of the liberals and conservative compared to other companies. that doesn't make the 20% the ndp gets an outlier, though.  it means that leger is doing something different in the way adjust their data or take polls. they do a lot of federal polling compared to other companies, so this is something to watch. it will be interesting if they can outperform the other companies in the next election  campaign. i think they did in the last election.",liberals

gjh7qmt,2021-01-16T01:01:03.000-08:00,"how are conservatives/conservatism different in canada vs united states the biggest difference is probably that canada has only half as many evangelicals as a proportion of our population, and they're much less politically active as a group. in the us, about half of the republican party's support comes from evangelical christians, whereas in canada, they are more like a quarter. this means that, whereas social conservative issues dominate in the republican party, they are kept at bay in the conservative party. in fact, the last prime minister was an evangelical christian, but he did not advance any socially conservative policies.

the second biggest difference is that we do not have as big of a problem with illegal immigration, so it is not nearly as important of a political issue. we also select for more highly educated immigrants than the us does which i think leads to more widespread support for immigration.",conservatives

now - does he put the party ahead of himself or choose to leave politics before the next election if the anti-trudeau sentiment gets worse? i don't know.

the anti-trudeau sentiment might be at its highest due to how many people don't like the covid measures and how scared and isolated it's made so many people and how that turned to anger over time. 

if it gets worse maybe he steps aside for the good of his party and takes on a non-office holding role. maybe he rides it to the end. maybe they do the last minute \"take a fall\" shuffle to reset for the election after they expect a wave of change and avoid setting up a big name for residual failure. no one wants to turn freeland into kim campbell v2.0 for example.

https://breachmedia.ca/erin-otoole-is-no-ally-of-labour-hes-a-conman/

&gt; he spoke of the plight of working people, railed against “big government” and “big business,” and promised to put “canada first.”

&gt; since then he’s bemoaned deindustrialization, lambasted free trade deals, talked about “too much power in the hands of corporate and financial elites,” and just a few weeks ago, released a platform with a suite of policies that appear to embrace worker’s rights.



&gt; [however,] what we are witnessing is the most savvy effort in some time by a canadian conservative leader to adopt the right-wing populist playbook of economic nationalism, fused to an agenda of corporate tax cuts, unfair trade deals, and militarism. 

&gt; - during his tenure at a bay street law firm, o’toole served as a lobbyist for facebook as they threatened to withhold investments in canada if the government didn’t grant them legal assurances. 

&gt; - and while donning a workmen’s bomber jacket, o’toole has used every opportunity to remind us that he comes from a “general motors family,” even though his father john o’toole was in fact a gm boss—a member of the anti-union management class. 

&gt; - o’toole sr. ultimately became a conservative mpp and supported ontario premier mike harris’s “common sense revolution” that eviscerated ontario’s public services. 

&gt; - after initially offering tepid support to the canada emergency response benefits (cerb), he later spoke ardently against it—calling it a “waste of money” that jeopardized people’s “work ethic” and cheapened the “nobility of work.” and as the economy has started to open up again, o’toole has aligned with the big business assault on cerb, as they desperately seek to lure workers back to unsafe, low-wage jobs. so much for being a warrior for working people.

&gt; - dan mader, the corporate lobbyist for uber in ontario, is the person in charge of the conservative party’s federal policy framework

&gt;canadian housing prices have been climbing for decades, well b4 the liberals came into power.  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian\\_property\\_bubble  
the home equity tax is just for flippers that live in a house for less than 12 months. this won't apply to most canadians.  
in fact, under the conservative plan, real estate investors will get to defer capital gains on rental properties. they will get to bid for replacement properties using pre-tax dollars while middle class families can only use after-tax dollars to bid for a home. that will only escalate house prices.

canada housing prices have been rising for decades, however they accelerated under the trudeau years.  in 2021 alone, housing prices were 32% higher nationally than they were in 2020.   the year before, housing prices rose 19%.   the year over year housing price average has never dropped under justin trudeau's government. 

[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-housing-boom-is-ripping-apart-the-financial-fabric-of-canadian/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-housing-boom-is-ripping-apart-the-financial-fabric-of-canadian/) 

meanwhile, the average wage increase under the trudeau years is 2.4%

the federal liberals have done nothing to stop foreign investors coming to canada and buying canadian real estate.  due to weak accounting disclosure laws, the ultimate beneficiary doesn't have to be named. 

&gt;canada is one of the most vaccinated countries in the world. it's ahead of france, uk, germany, us to name a few.

not in february it wasn't, it was ranked in the 70s.  because of the failed cansino partnership, canada was late placing orders with large pharmaceutical companies and entered into poorly negotiated contracts that lead to numerous delays.  for example, in dec 2020 the uk imported 5 million doses of the pfizer vaccine while canada only imported 500 000 doses. 

the fact that canada has such a high vaccination rate, despite the stumble out of the gate more has to do with canadians stepping up and doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated than anything else. 

&gt;covid caused the entire global economy to shut down. economically, canada hasn't faced a drop in gdp this bad since the great depression. gdp declined by about 5.5% during covid. the great recession was a cake walk in comparison.  
the only option for all world governments was to flood main street with cash in the form of support programs. world governments had learned from the great depression that austerity doesn't work in times of crisis. yes, inflation is generated but it's a hell of a lot better than seeing millions of citizens in soup lines and being evicted or having their mortgages foreclosed. a hell of a lot more businesses would have been foreclosed and a lot more personal suffering would have occurred if world governments didn't take swift action. inflation doesn't just exist in canada which many fail to acknowledge. it exists in europe, us, and asia as a result of the pandemic. we live in a global economy and the entire supply chain grounded to a halt.

i never said the canadian government should cut spending during covid, but that doesn't mean reckless spending should be justified neither.  over the course of covid-19, canada’s deficit has grown faster than any other developed country, with the debt forecast to hit $1.6 trillion this year.

[https://globalnews.ca/news/8156408/daunting-debt-what-the-pandemic-public-spending-spree-will-mean-for-canadas-post-covid-economy/](https://globalnews.ca/news/8156408/daunting-debt-what-the-pandemic-public-spending-spree-will-mean-for-canadas-post-covid-economy/) 

this isn't surprising considering the cerb program outpaced wage loses.  this may explain why people aren't coming back to work. 

[https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/liberals-covid-19-benefit-programs-continue-to-outpace-wage-losses-new-statscan-data-show](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/liberals-covid-19-benefit-programs-continue-to-outpace-wage-losses-new-statscan-data-show) 

&gt;the federal government is made up of more than one individual. there are numerous departments, countless procedures, and many checks and balances. canadians don't care about trudeau. they only care about themselves and what their government will do for them in their hour of need.

i am talking about one individual, justin trudeau (although as i mentioned before, members of his cabinet have also had numerous ethical breaches as well).  justin trudeau has been found to violate the ethic rules twice, one for accepting a vacation to the aga kahn's private island and the other for the snc lavalin affair.  at least he was willing to admit, during this third ethics investigation that he \"made a mistake\" giving we charity $1 billion to start a youth volunteer program while his family and cabinet were paid for speaking engagements.  

&gt;most minority governments end in about 2 years because they are inherently unstable.

&gt;as for the pandemic, elections canada expected 5 million mail in ballot requests. it received under a million. guest people aren't too scared to vote.

this is hilarious, i actually laughed out loud (and not just from citing wikipedia neither!)

the only way that the canadian government can indirectly influence monetary policy is by spending and taxation, since the boc considers this when setting monetary policy. however, for the boc to *use less stimulus*, the feds would need to *spend more* and or *tax less*, increasing the deficit further. based on your comments here about spending and the deficit, i don’t imagine you would want the feds to borrow more.

1. the problem with the housing market right now is that it was government induced. the bank of canada printed $300b in new dollars to fund the government programs which led to asset inflation.

2. i haven’t seen the entirety of the cpc plan for climate change but i do think their policy now is the most effective use of dollars. if every carbon tax dollar *has* to be spent on green technology - that’s huge. it seems like they’ve copied the carbon tax and made it more efficient. if this was a ndp policy i think it’d be championed by reddit and likely condemned by the cpc. 

3. the government programs that everyone is using are funded with newly printed money. this is the problem - not the government programs, just that no one is paying for them.

4. the ndp is offering a solid plan for housing and i also consider them a valid contender for my vote.

5. i haven’t seen any good plans to deal with these issues. i do see a hypocritical trudeau who champions these issues while talking but kicks women out of caucus for following the law (jody wilson-raybould and jane philpott) and protects privileged white men in the military for abusing women.",liberals

hd3ies1,2021-09-16T02:36:27.000-07:00,"i'm really on the fence regarding the vaccine mandates in the western world i think mandating the vaccine sets a dangerous precedent to mandate things that infringe on personal autonomy.

i'm afraid that vaxxports, once implemented, will never leave...instead they could morph into whatever current standard that the government decides is for the greater good of the nation. a digital passport like that could become used for things like you can't do such and such unless your taxes are paid, unless your car is fully registered... what if it becomes like australia where you have to check in with the app to make sure you're not somewhere you're \"not supposed to be\"? what if the app listens to us (like alexa or apple home or whatever) and we start seeing consequences for \"hate speech\" or \"treasonous opinions\" in our own homes?

i know that those are slippery slope arguments and what-ifs. but the pathway to losing freedoms usually doesn't just happen overnight. it's by allowing small infringements here and there until it's too late. that is why people are fighting so hard. we've seen it on a larger and more horrific scale historically with nazi germany. (and probably plenty of other instances around the globe.) the things is it seems so reasonable and civilized until it's not. but even last year, this conversation would have been unthinkable and written off as disinformation or extremely radical conspiracy theories. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;as long as we can keep our government in check, i think the mandate might be worth it for the good of the country.

i don't think we can. i know the election is just around the corner, but there's a big likelihood that both the party in power and the opposition will be on the same side when it comes to mandates and vaxxports. how can we keep the government in check if all the people in all the power agree? that's why people are pushing back so hard.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;my fear with american conservatism is it sometimes worships liberty to an unhealthy degree

i can agree with that. but i think conservatives also have a history of being split: 1) the people who say over and over \"this isn't such a big thing to give up to keep the peace\" until it's too late; and 2) the people who look far ahead at what could happen several steps down the road if such and such is left unchecked.  i think there can be an overlap between that second group and true conspiracy theorists, but honestly both sides have problems.",conservatives

the simple truth of the matter can be found deep in the pages of innovative's poll that just came out: a much higher percentage of ontarians consider themselves to be liberals than consider themselves to be new democrats. not that they're party members or even particularly faithful to the party. it's just how they see themselves. there's a full century of heritage behind that.

given that it's not an election season, people are reverting back to those traditional distinctions. people who don't follow politics very much aren't really thinking about who del duca and horwath are personally, they're just saying \"i'm not a ford supporter\", and the default answer to that question - when not thinking too deeply about it - is liberal. many of these people voted ndp last time around and might well vote ndp next time around when they're back to paying attention. they don't see any real inconsistency in that, either: voting ndp from time to time is something that a self-described liberal (maybe i shouldn't even be capitalising the l) would do.

what does this mean? it means leading in a bunch of polls isn't *that* good news for the olp and being in third in a bunch of polls isn't *that* bad news for the ndp. as always, the \"non-conservative\" vote is fluid and undecided. once we're all talking in earnest about an upcoming election, a lot of things could change.",liberals

right. rephrasing my question: \"when was it ever necessary to impose restrictions on catholic clothing options in the public sphere?\"

first poll in a while that has the cpc above 30%, which normally should be their floor so they'll be hoping this is a rebound and not an outlier. however i'm inclined to think it's the latter as i'm not sure what has happened recently that would shore up the brand with lpc-cpc swing voters or bring disillusioned conservatives back into the fold. 

on a different note: the gender/age breakdown is fascinating. cpc is getting slaughtered among women. their highest in the grouping is 29% in 55+ (lpc 43/ndp 14). the younger you go the worse it gets (which is to be somewhat expected): 

35-54: cpc 24/lpc 40/ndp 25.  

18-34: cpc 13/lpc 31/ndp 45.

there is a thought-provoking article in business insider from yesterday that borrowed the expertise of an anonymous french police official who trained with the us in public security: 

&gt; \"you cannot tell me i don't know what they should have done. i can fly to washington tomorrow and do that job, just as any police official in washington can fly to paris and do mine,\" the official said. the official directs public security in a central paris police district filled with government buildings and tourist sites.

&gt; \"these are not subtle principles\" for managing demonstrations, \"and they transfer to every situation,\" the official said. \"this is why we train alongside the us federal law enforcement to handle these very matters, and it's obvious that large parts of any successful plan were just ignored.\"

&gt; the french police official said they believed that an investigation would find that someone interfered with the deployment of additional federal law-enforcement officials on the perimeter of the capitol complex; the official has direct knowledge of the proper procedures for security of the facility. 

&gt; https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-attempted-coup-federal-law-enforcement-capitol-police-2021-1

but, for a *chance* at a *successful* coup attempt, there needed to be an ***intentionally*** weakened security infrastructure. that requires inside planning and deliberate sabotage of preparations.

there are a lot of questions that need to be answered:

why didn't the capitol police ask for help in advance?

&gt; three days before the pro-president trump riot at the capitol, the pentagon asked the u.s. capitol police if it needed national guard manpower. and as the mob descended on the building wednesday, justice department leaders reached out to offer up fbi agents. the police turned them down both times, according to a defense official and two people familiar with the matter.

&gt; https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-07/dc-riots-capitol-police-reject-federal-help

why do you think trump subsequently refused demands to call in the national guard!? 

&gt; trump, who has proven over the past year to be eager to deploy the national guard when violence breaks out, initially resisted doing so on capitol hill wednesday as a mob of his supporters breached the building, per a source familiar. pence played a key role in coordinating with the pentagon about deploying them, and urged them to move faster than they were.

&gt; https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/pence-national-guard/index.html

and if you think that police at the capitol are somehow incompetent or naturally lenient, listen to *ex-congressman* [joe scarborough's rant](https://youtu.be/51gwesd9stq) if you doubt for a second.

now, it was clear to anyone (including me) who took 15 minutes to browse the donald (in its new off-reddit home) or similar sites that trump's hardcore supporters were planning an insurrection:

&gt; on forum boards like thedonald and antigovernment and militia movement group chats, those conversations included plans to surround the capitol on all sides, alongside maps of the u.s. capitol complex marked with locations of tunnels and entry points. \"and there was discussion specifically of overwhelming police with large crowds and doing that in order to violate laws against carrying weapons and against entering federal buildings,\" holt says.

&gt; https://www.npr.org/sections/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates/2021/01/07/954671745/on-far-right-websites-plans-to-storm-capitol-were-made-in-plain-sight

personally, i thought it would go down as a fantastic failure like that idiotic [storm area 51 event](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/storm_area_51) last year. but in nevada, the police were ready and waiting. 

in retrospect, that event feels like a perfect test run of this insurrection. i can only wonder if it functioned as a proof of concept. can we stir up enough people, all at once, to risk their lives and freedom on a stupid idea? america's right-wing (including trump) have been experimenting with [stochastic terrorism](https://theintercept.com/2019/08/04/el-paso-dayton-mass-shootings-donald-trump/) for many years. that side of the equation was perfected ages ago: the messages have been calibrated to get the exact response they wanted. 

the us needs to hold a deep investigation of those in charge of policing, not just because of the racial disparities of the response, but because this looks like *conspiracy* to enable a coup. and i think that trudeau and other world leaders may have more than a hint of evidence that us law enforcement - at the very least capitol hill police - may have been conspiring or collaborating to enable trump's supporters to overthrow their elected representatives.",liberals

we do not need to get our resource sector goign when we already know the way the winds are going, and powerless to change them. what we need to do is better by those hurt by it. if we're going to kill the resource sector, than we have to have cerb like support for those put out. just like during the pandemic the government can't kill jobs and not help. i do not believe however restarting the resource economy is the right move.

manufacturing. ok. agreed. we as a country dropped the ball on this for decades though. i'm not sure either cpc or lpc can ever claim innocence on this file. 

the lower taxes on families is a pipe dream right now if we don't actually make sure that the revenues continue from those who can afford to pay for it. lowering family and middle class taxes is going ot require more income. the elite and rich. the corps, the businesses will then be the ones that pay that.  especially post covid and making up for the spending that we have had to do.

right now, i believ the ndp have the most likely platform to do that... even though i hold no illusion that they will become government any time soon.
