another 'side effect' is that if the bank raises their rates, then their gic's and other investment instruments will also go up. which means the gov'ts bonds and such will have to rise or investors won't be interested. which means suddenly all that debt that trudeau borrows will be at a much higher interrest rate, and the debt he's already borrowed will eventually jump to that rate in the next few years. meaning many tens of billions of dollars in interest payments. which weakens our currency value in the world. which means rates tend to go up. 

and yes - trudeau could care less. even if he were fired today, he has a large pension for life from the gov't, he has his daddy's trust fund money that he still gets (which will pay out even more if interest rates go up) and there's enough deluded fans that he will still make 30 - 50 thousand dollars just for a speaking engagement. which means hes' putting money in the bank - at higher interest rates.",liberals

my problem is the way both quebec and ottawa have handled this situation. the proper way to make a change like this to quebec's status within the constitution isn't a unilateral declaration by quebec that the pmo just greenlights, it's something that must go through an amendment process. when new brunswick declared itself officially bilingual, it required a formal constitutional amendment process - quebec's changing its official status without even doing that.

this is more than meaningless \"muh constitution\" rambling, it raises real questions. say tomorrow, new brunswick decides to remove french as a co-official language through a simple legislature vote. what then? as far as the law is concerned, nb is equal to quebec. so if quebec is able do something, why shouldn't they?if the reason is that quebec is different and should be an autonomous region, then sure, let's officially make quebec an autonomous region, or a \"province plus\" with extra rights. but if we allow one province to just unilaterally skip steps in the canadian constitution, then it is a worthless piece of paper that has no legal bearing. that is the situation i worry about, because i do care about canada, and i don't want opportunistic premiers using quebec's precedent to make changes to the foundational ideas of this country for political gain.

the brave thing for trudeau to do is to say, okay, let's add an amendment to the constitution that recognizes quebec's autonomy and distinguishes between quebec and the other nine provinces. but he doesn't want to do that. on the other extreme, he could hold up the constitution as it currently exists and force quebec to do it the proper way. he doesn't want to do that either. it's political cowardice on his part, and apparently every other politician in canada. but we're just kicking this can down the road for some future government to deal with, and it will be much harder then than it is now.

on legault's part though, wow, that man knows how to do politics. this was a win-win scenario for him in every way. trudeau accepted legault's decision, and now legault has the legacy of finally getting quebec's \"nation\" status recognized. had trudeau refused, he would have gotten to fight ottawa again like on bill 21 and fire up the base. i don't agree with his views on a lot of things, but he's probably the strongest leader anywhere in canada right now.",liberals

[provincial polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_alberta_general_election#opinion_polling) tells a clearer story, i think. although the abndp seems to have picked-up some of the lost ucp support, it's the rise of the new wildrose party that is probably sapping away the majority of ucp support. kenney's bare-minimum effort to contain covid through public health restrictions was the ultimate betrayal for the so-con base that is constantly drunk on trumpian \"restrictions = communist dictatorship\" media. you know things are bad for the ucp when rural albertans threw a \"no more jason kenney\" rodeo.

the question is whether or not this shift away from the \"mainstream\" conservative party will also happen on the federal level. with o'toole as leader suggesting that climate change is real, i think it's certainly possible a lot of traditional cpc voters will either stay home or vote ppc - there's a reason why bernier has been hitting-up the prairies and attending anti-lockdown protests. i think that a lot of it will depend on the timing of the election; if it happens long enough after we're out of the thick of covid, people will be more willing to forgive and forget in the name of unseating the lpc.",conservatives

we'll have to agree to disagree on canada being a relic of the british empire, or that the 10 provinces should just be independent and only coordinate when convenient. i think you're underestimating how important being canadian is to most non-quebecers. only alberta comes close in regional identity and even that's really more about politics/economics than nationalism. but it just shows that many quebecers see confederation differently from most canadians, and that's the heart of the problem.

you make a good point about meech and 1995 traumatizing both sides. i was born just a few months before the 1995 referendum so i'm too young to remember, but from my understanding of canadian history, 1980-1995 was a pretty dark time and nobody wants a repeat. but my worry is, by making these kinds of decisions, we're just creating a lot of vague and contradictory grey areas in our constitution and setting ourselves up for future crises. again, what happens when other provinces decide to start making politically-motivated constitutional changes? i know you probably don't care much about that, but most canadian federalists don't want to see our constitution unravel.

i think what trudeau and legault decided is the ~~best~~ *least worst* option for now, because the last thing we need in the middle of covid is a conflict about quebec. but we're just delaying the crisis for future governments to deal with. but maybe that will finally give us the courage to grow a pair, reopen the constitution, and clarify once and for all what canada is and how quebec fits into that.

in 2011, the liberals were a mess. their leader was not cut out for partisan politics, the chretien-martin power struggle had hollowed out the lpc machine, they were having trouble raising funds, their history of corruption scandals loomed large, and there was a conservative prime minister hell-bent on destroying the liberal party.

the bloc quebecois was a different kind of a mess. quebec nationalism was fizzling out, the bloc were a tired old party stuck in the 1990s with a leader who had stayed on too long. it was also apparent that as long as quebec kept sending 40-50 bloquistes to the house, harper wasn't going down.

it was under these circumstances that the orange wave happened - which, may i remind you, was primarily a quebec thing. quebecers wanted to end harper's reign, and bon jack appealed more to them than professor mike. in the rest of canada, while the ndp did well, it wasn't that much of a wave. they won 44 seats outside quebec, which is one more than broadbent got in 1988, and only eight more than layton got in 2008. the orange wave was mainly a quebec phenomenon born out of truly unique circumstances.

recreating the orange wave with a familiar blueprint requires:

1. *severely* weakened liberal party
2. bloc collapse
3. ndp leader who appeals to quebec
4. an unpopular conservative pm that you can rally against

and even then, it's not a winning blueprint, nor a sustainable one. the liberal party is an institution that can survive a few bad elections (and it seems like at least the next election will be a good one for them), the bloc may well wither away after blanchet leaves and boomers die out but that's no guarantee that the ndp will take their mantle, a leader like jack is hard to come by, and you won't always have a stephen harper to oppose.

the apology is based on the idea that italian-canadians were interned “for the simple reason that they were of italian heritage.\"

however, the article points out that there were over 100,000 italian-canadians and only 500 were interned (0.5%), at a time when about 3500 italian-canadians were involved in fascist organizations.

historians have indicated that the police did not intern italian-canadians based on blanket assumptions about the entire community, but instead targeted specific individuals suspected of involvement in fascist activity, typically based on evidence.

in some cases the police may have gotten it wrong, but that's still a very different story than what happened to japanese canadians, who were rounded up indiscriminately.

&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;fortunately, historians have studied this topic in some detail, so we have answers. *enemies within: italian and other internees in canada and abroad*,  edited by franca iacovetta, roberto perin and angelo principe is a  comprehensive takedown of the claim that canada waged a “war against  ethnicity” when interning italian-canadians.  
&gt;  
&gt;**instead,  the book finds that benito mussolini’s diplomats in canada aggressively  promoted fascism among italian-canadians and met with some success –  although only a small minority of italian-canadians were involved in  fascist organizations.** **such people caught the attention of the rcmp**,  which compiled what historian luigi bruti liberati describes in the book  as “a detailed picture of fascist activity in canada, from the largest  urban centres to the most distant mining camps.”  
&gt;  
&gt;mr. liberati notes there are valid reasons to question the accuracy of the  rcmp’s conclusions. **but they were based on evidence, however imperfect,  rather than on blanket assumptions about the entire community.**  
&gt;  
&gt;mr.  liberati compiled his own biographical database of the internees. **he  found police had detailed dossiers indicating involvement in fascist organizations for at least 100 of them. even 500, however, represented a  small fraction of the 3,500 italian-canadians known to have been  members of local fascist groups.**  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;were  some wrongly accused? certainly, and the harm from that injustice  persisted. but ottawa’s actions were not comparable to those of a police  state, he concludes. **“this judgment seems to ignore the fact that  fascism was well founded in canada and that a certain number of italian  canadians had supported it actively, not hesitating on occasion to  resort to acts of violence against co-nationals and anti-fascists.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;that  last detail underscores the greatest damage done by mr. trudeau’s  planned apology. **to claim that italian-canadians were interned because  of their ethnicity suggests that they were representative of the entire  italian-canadian community. they were not. suggesting otherwise erases  the history of italian-canadians who fought fascism, at home and abroad,  instead of cheering its murderous advance.**

it may be too late, but hopefully those planning this apology will read this article and hit the brakes until they've double-checked what happened and why, to confirm whether an apology is actually appropriate.",liberals

people think reconciliation is just a matter of white people needing to 'feel bad' for indigenous people losing their land. in reality, it's about the legal failings of the canadian state that are evidenced in historical and ongoing actions that need to be acknowledged. non-indigenous canadians should know and understand the ways in which the canadian state has violated the rights of indigenous people and how that has shaped indigenous communities",liberals

the liberals announced the transition to the crb in early august, and the ndp continued to claim there was no plan to replace the cerb for nearly two months, panicking many needlessly who only get their news through ndp twitter. the ndp did get the crb raised from 1600 pre-taxed to 1800 pre-taxed (2000 before tax), and improvements on sick leave. there was 9 billion in the pandemic package for students.

i think it would have been better to deliver a basic income instead of the cerb, which is what singh was asking for, but the liberals were trying to make it an unemployment benefit while making the bar low to get it, so it helped out as many as possible - i see why they did this politically but there are many who fell through the cracks, even with the 5,000 dollar figure.

the ndp no doubt contributed to discussions and trudeau thanked the ndp, there was a lot to deal with at the beginning of the pandemic other than social supports, and the parties were actually talking together. i think it was really counterproductive for singh to claim 100% of the credit, as this just made a trudeau not want to deal with him at all, and if you keep taking away all credit from a pm that is taking all the flak for programs many criticized (lazy people in cerb, etc), then that pm might just not bother with progressive programs. really, the ndps hostile approach has been a bad strategy and a missed opportunity.",liberals

i wanted to give your argument every chance so to enlighten myself i'm on the ppc website.  i've spent almost an hour back and forth on it.  if you have any specific article you'd like me to read i will.  

first article i read is about indigenous issues.  it's just at the top of the list, so i started there.  their standpoint seems to hold water;  historic governments treated them very poorly to say the least, any many are in a bad state with various issues.  ppc wants to completely rewrite the indian act, and review the allotment of the $24b annually spent on indigenous programs.   i see that as \"everyone to the table and lets sort this shit out for real.\"   no racism here.  housing;  this touches on immigration because the current targets of 350-400k immigration annually puts massive pressure on the two most popular target housing markets for new canadians;  toronto and vancouver.  their argument is second and further generation canadian kids trying to move out of their parents house cannot compete with established foreign families bidding on housing in those markets.   i don't see this as racism, but i can see where you're getting the link.  most visible immigrants are setting in those two major cities and that's the source of this policy statement.  however 150k targets mean white immigrants will also be denied.    its not about where they're coming from - it's where they're going to.  i'm not saying i agree with it but i can see where it gets traction.

i agree with you completely on the mask issue.  i truly dislike how people say \"masks don't protect you from the virus\" because *technically* they're right.  they offer a level of protection from you potentially spreading it, and a far lower level of protection to you contracting it.  the ppc do have a valid point that the elderly were not protected by locking down.  deaths from covid are certainly highest in upper ages and nursing home outbreaks.  as a parent i'm not convinced my children were better served not going to school for all those months.  my children are far behind on their learning, and only because of our prior savings, and our essential worker status could my partner and i pay for all the additional costs of my children staying home (plus the computer equipment we needed to purchase to put them all online for school).   we will not be able to erraticate this virus without a real, complete and total shutdown.  plug the border crossings, shut down air traffic, issue food pantries to everyone.  a *real* shutdown like new zealand did.   

i completely agree with the ppc plans on balancing the federal budget.  nothing happens without the money to do it, and we're so deep in the red my grandchildren will still be paying it - and that's if we stopped overspending today!  which we won't because liberal and ndp have no plans to balance the budget.  the nordic countries i admire all have little or no debt.  that's part of how they can afford all those awesome programs.   high taxes like us, but good budgets, programs, spending, and health care.  and education too!  with liberal governments i will never see canada get there.  cpc has a 10 year plan to balance (yay?). 

i agree with ppc firearms program.  i own and have owned many many firearms over many years.  from little to very big.  i do not hunt - they're purely for my own enjoyment.  the statement \"require that all firearms categories be based on function, not on looks or arbitrary political whims, and reclassify all firearms based on the simplified classification system as proposed by the canadian shooting sports association. this will remove ineffective restrictions which unfairly target sport shooters, but have no deterrent effect on criminals.\" is spot on.  i am being targeted because i own ar-15(s) for sporting use.  locked up since may of 2020.  i won't get into it in detail unless you're interested in the debate, but sufficed to say locking up my guns didn't make you any safer.  

i **disagree** with their climate action plan.  or lack of.  carefully worded \"there is however no scientific consensus on the theory...\" gives them the wiggle room that technically there isn't.  i cannot believe our co2 emissions are good for the environment though.  anyway this one is bullshit.

and finally \"canadian identity\".  the spirit of the statement is \"you came to canada so you should become canadian\".  my friends statement of \"they left their homelands because canada is better, right?  but if they don't become canadians themselves is that not destroying exactly what they came here to enjoy?\".  i didn't have an answer to that.  on the surface, it seems right;  join our schools, learn one of the official languages and say hi to your neighbour.  did you read down to the bottom of their \"refugees\" statement?  \"give priority to refugees belonging to persecuted groups who have nowhere to go in neighbouring countries. for example: christians, yazidis, and members of other minority religions in majority muslim countries; members of the ahmadi community, and other muslims in these countries who are persecuted because they reject political islam and adhere to western values; and members of sexual minorities.\"   i mean i don't see anywhere that it's saying anything about excluding a race.  they're saying \"slow it down.  we've built something good here and it's getting over-run\".

in summation, i don't think the ppc are being given a truly fair shake.  i didn't vote for them simply because they had no chance to unseat trudeau and i feel strongly that we've made a very bad financial mistake in re-electing him.  another $650m in the hole, for basically a cabinet shuffle.  i think if the cpc had elected dr. lewis as party leader we would have a cpc majority right now.  immigrant, doctor, with a degree in economics, and a person of colour too.  i would have loved to see her as pm.",liberals

i think that's a complicated answer. are you willing to accept that it's not cut and dried?

we're not australia, new zealand, taiwan, or any kind of island nation. we're not even south korea, who only shares a land border with north korea that isn't exactly \"open.\" we share the longest undefended land border in the world, and when covid started we shared it with a president who took every action as a personal affront to his family name and was not above petty spite.

had we unilaterally closed the border for the first time in history, i think we would have seen a complete shutdown of ppe, other medical supplies, food, and general goods from down south. given the thousands of kilometers long porous border with the us which would have allowed transit by flights from other nations, i'm not sure clamping down on all travel would have helped at that point.

also consider [what did happen](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-coronavirus-pandemic-trudeau-borders-1.5619705) when we closed the border at the time we did:

&gt;no one will ever know how many covid cases entered canada after prime minister justin trudeau told canadian snowbirds on march 16 that it was \"time to come home,\" triggering an exodus from florida straight through the american covid-19 epicentre of new york and new jersey.

you cannot shut your own citizens out, and asking them to fly during the peak of the pandemic through necessary stopovers in hotspots would probably best be avoided -- but in the end we couldn't.

suffice it to say it's a lot more complicated than screaming \"close the border, stupid!\" maybe it's more clear 18 months on, but march of 2020 everything was brand new. data on covid was sketchy at best. perhaps we hoped for sars like containment, when we didn't close our borders and kept it relatively contained to major cities.",liberals

having said that, i will trust you understand the following is my opinion and nothing more.

i support the liberal parties, left wing, pro immigration, pro equality, pro capitalism, yet fiscally responsible governance.  my 46 years of experience have seen the pc’s who preach but do not practice smaller government and less taxation, slowly turn into a party that caters to a right wing extremism that is frankly frightening.

i see the ndp as a bit too far left for my taste, and while i agree in principle with many of their policies, when i dig into them i don’t see them implementing them in a fiscally responsible way.  having said that i voted for and supported jagmeet singh when he was my mpp here in bramalea.  he is an excellent politician.  i have also voted ndp provincially in the last 3 elections because, as you say, this is not sports and the ondp offered the best platform for me and my community the last few election cycles.

for me the liberal party has been dependable, forward thinking, financially responsible, and left of centre enough for me to be comfortable.  they have, in my opinion provided the best platform federally the last 2 decades.  having said that i have voted ndp in the past during that time as well when jack layton put out a better platform.",liberals

h4qxcje,2021-07-10T08:26:47.000-07:00,"‘stuffed’: how australia’s ‘unconscionable’ gamble on covid vaccines backfired **rule 5 explanation:**

this article touches on australia's experience with their covid-19 vaccine rollout so far, which, by many measures, is a failure compared to similar countries. canada remains miles ahead of australia in their vaccine rollout. 

it notes that australia was actually [near the back of the line](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/01/australia-at-back-of-the-queue-for-pfizer-covid-vaccines-minister-admits) for pfizer vaccines - to the contrary of numerous statements made by [michelle rempel](https://www.ourcommons.ca/publicationsearch/en/?view=d&amp;parlses=43-2&amp;oob=&amp;topic=&amp;proc=&amp;per=71902&amp;text=%22back%20of%20the%20line%22&amp;rpp=15&amp;order=&amp;targetlang=&amp;sbs=0&amp;mrr=150000&amp;pubtype=37) and [erin o'toole](https://www.ourcommons.ca/publicationsearch/en/?targetlang=&amp;text=%22back+of+the+line%22&amp;pubtype=37&amp;parlses=&amp;topic=&amp;proc=&amp;per=72773&amp;com=&amp;oob=&amp;pubid=&amp;cauc=&amp;prov=&amp;parttype=&amp;page=1&amp;rpp=15#) - with the bulk of mrna vaccines not arriving in australia until later this year. furthermore, it notes that australia did not take a \"hedge as many bets as possible\" approach to vaccine procurement - first going with a domestic + astrazeneca approach, then pivoting to pfizer when it was clear that australia was late to the game.

a few erin o'toole quotes from the official record that have been debunked with this article: 

&gt; november 30, 2020: \"as i said earlier, countries with 2.7 billion people will be served before canada. this means we are near the back of the line.\"

&gt; november 24, 2020: \"two months later, he is admitting that he was wrong. he does not have priority access to the vaccine. we are still at the back of the line.\"

&gt; october 28, 2020: \"will the prime minister tell the house why he signed a contract that guarantees canada will be at the back of the line when it comes to the vaccine rollout?\"

so, while some canadian politicians do continue to believe that canada is at the back of the line and lagging the world in vaccine procurement and their rollout processes, this article pours ice cold water on those thoughts.",conservatives

one other point i’d make is that if every other province in canada had adopted the same policies from alberta’s climate leadership plan, that would have been enough to hit our initial paris agreement targets (not sure about the updated 40-45% reduction targets tho)

and as far as oil and gas emissions go, the plan had the 100mt emissions cap as well as ccir emissions pricing for large emitters and then the carbon price for small emitters, o&amp;g was captured under those along with all other industries. if you set emissions pricing you shouldn’t really need to single out one specific industry, the more polluting an industry is the more cost prohibitive it becomes.",liberals

that he has tried to use unjustified attacks on other third party academics as defense from criticism from his conflicts of interest is what i am calling out.

if you read the article he primes the reader that attacks against academics by ndp supporters are unjustified fringe conspiracy and then goes on to bring up an example of winter being attacked for her conflicts only being a volunteer seats on a couple of boards that get funding from energy companies for which he then links his conflicts.  here i will tell you that i am not a supporter of those attacks on winter.  you can't work in the environmental industry without dealing with the energy sector.  science is expensive and our government under funds our institutions.  but that is a far cry from direct work for which is also an even farther cry from directly working on the platform.",liberals

for that person, the total cost of the program is $0, not $24,000. they are neither paying more in taxes, nor are they receiving more in funding. they break even on the program.

as you step out from that income, those figures will drift apart. someone who is only making $79,000 a year will be paid $24,000, and pay an extra (say) $23,500 in taxes. where does the extra $500 come from? depending on factors that haven't yet been precisely set, there would be a taxpayer making some amount over $80,000 a year - say, $87,000 a year - that will end up being paid $24,000 from the ubi but being taxed an additional $24,500. you could say that this program 'cost' $500 for those two, as it net transferred $500 from one to another.

when you take the value of the ubi and multiply it by the population, you treat that $500 transfer as a $48,000 expense. it's why the figure you're listing is wrong. it's also why i can't give you the precise cost. it would vary a lot from week to week, depending on relative income distributions in canada within that week. they also haven't actually settled on $2000 a month as the final figure.

but it also wouldn't be accurate to say that that individual $500 transfer *cost* $500. for the case of our two relatively affluent taxpayers, it might be the case, but the plan for the ubi is to use it to phase out other forms of social spending. for example, it would roll in virtually all of the spending from ei, but at a much lower staffing cost, and replace a variety of poverty assistance programs that spend a significant portion of their budgets on administration. before you even consider a study that showed that it would save the government over $7b a year in health care costs, much of the programs remaining budget (again, depending on what they pick) would be replacing existing budgetary expenses. it's less administratively intense.

so, that's essentially what you're missing. while it's $24,000 a year on paper, for most canadians it'll be just a few hundred dollars, except for those most in need, who are already receiving that money in less efficient ways.",liberals

a chief unspoken reason the tories don't have a youth wing is that the type of person to be a committed right-winger and tory insider when they're young, as opposed to joining due to \"life experience\" moving them to the right, is likely going to be said fiery populist pr nightmare. basically, it would look a hell of a lot like canada/ontario proud. i would like to think that that doesn't represent thornhill, but it *does* happen to be [the home of some prominent underground hate](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/never-again-canada-jdl-facebook) under the guise of – you guessed it – being pro-israel.

from the 2018 cpip:

“planning for the delivery of health care in a pandemic is a particular challenge as there is little excess capacity in the canadian health care system”

“primary care surge capacity can be enhanced by pt strategies such as new fee codes for telephone advice and prescribing, temporarily allowing practice expansion to patients who are not registered with the practice (when this is not normally permitted), and expanding the role of other health professionals and non-traditional workers (e.g., allowing prescribing of antiviral medications by pharmacists). influenza assessment centres and alternate care sites may be needed in some communities, particularly in high-impact situations. responsibility for their establishment is best determined in advance so that appropriate planning can take place.”

the left loves to say they’ll raise taxes on the rich and the right loves to point out that existing tax rates are already quite progressive (which they are).

the problem is the super rich don’t pay income tax because they don’t report their true income. canada has de facto legalized tax evasion (as the video points out there are no “loopholes”) through tax treaties with tax havens like barbados where the super rich can legally shelter their income oversees. 

also billionaires don’t typically pay themselves via salary. instead take out loans backed by their equity in firms to finance that new mansion or yacht. this is not taxed as income and is often paid off by their estate when they die by selling their equity(and taxed as a gain at 50% in future instead of 100% now).

hadgs17,2021-08-25T12:09:25.000-07:00,"opinion: jagmeet singh is on a roll. this is bad news for justin trudeau the average condo price in toronto is about $750 000. you can still find condos for $500 000 or $600 000 within the city limits. those are homes. 

if you’re 26 with a maxed tfsa with 6% returns you’d have $80-85k. plus $35k hbp is $115k. if you’re 30 a maxed tfsa with 6% returns is $120-125k. plus $35k hbp is $155k.  to get to the magical $200k down payment we need either $85k more or $45k more. assuming the 26 year old invested $15k at 22 in a non registered account they’d have $88k at 26. currently that $28k capital gain would cost you about $6k in income tax if you make $100k through employment (i’m using ontario tax rates throughout). this puts you at $197k down payment total. if the capital gains inclusion rate increased to 75% then you’d get taxed an additional $3k and your total down payment would be $194k. if you were 30 and have $155k available tax free then you need 45k. $1250 from when you’re 22 to 30 gets you about $15k. the capital gain is about $5k which would be $1.1k in taxes under current rates and $1.6k with a 75% inclusion rate if you make $100k. the difference in this case is $500. either way you can get to a down payment on a million dollar home with a relatively small increase in your tax payments. even the larger difference is only 0.3% of the value of the house. i doubt this policy would really have any significant effect on a first time home buyers ability to buy a home.

i’m also not suggesting that people have their home as their only retirement vehicle, and the hbp doesn’t require you to. it’s (more or less) a 15 year 35 000 interest free loan from yourself (with potential negative tax implications and a reduced returns from the investment). but for most people your home and it’s value is a significant part of your retirement.

i do think that the housing crisis needs to be fixed, but it’s not going to be fixed by lowering the capital gains inclusion rate.

i don’t know how anything i’ve said suggests that i’m “far left”. i haven’t advocated for anything that’s far left here (the abolition of private ownership, gulags, killing birds, or the abolition of money.)",liberals

hdwg35n,2021-09-22T09:37:19.000-07:00,"opinion: if anyone should be stepping down, it’s the likeable jagmeet singh &gt; i felt like particularly in the first couple weeks of the campaign, singh was doing really well, emphasizing popular policies and connecting with voters while trudeau was floundering and losing ground. but the polls for the ndp didn't budge. i'd like to understand why that was.

my operating theory: the ndp message was more popular to insiders than to the marginal voter, and youth don't turn out.

the ndp platform had by far the most to offer a young university student or recent graduate, and the 'unlimited zeal' for taxing the rich plays well among that university crowd.  opinion polls had the ndp twice as favoured as the liberals among the youth demographic (either 18-25 or 18-35 depending on the firm).

_but_, this crowd has a persistent turnout problem, voting at [about 2/3 the rate](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/eval/pes2019/vtsa&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e) of the senior cohort.  in those same surveys, seniors tended to favour the lpc.

in my opinion, this demographic weight by itself explains why the ndp saw a vote share at the lower end of its pre-election polling range.

in the meantime, the ndp also has a persistent problem gaining earned media and being seen as not just credible but as a source of good policy between elections.  the ndp loses out because while it's seen as progressive, the liberals have an easier time defining what \"progressive\" means.

i'm not sure anybody has a surefire recipe to fix it, but i think one approach might be to hammer on a single policy file for the entire term.  pre-covid, i thought that pharmacare was the ndp's most winning policy (i still do), and i occasionally counted how long singh's twitter feed would go between mentions.",liberals

&gt;in that campaign, when mr. mulcair took a principled stand in support of a woman’s right to wear a niqab, support collapsed and the party fell to just 16 quebec members. but it was still enough to hold a base, especially with a quebecker as leader.

&gt;but in a foolhardy, precipitous move, the party dumped mr. mulcair. it then turned to mr. singh, who had no presence in the province. the religious symbols issue has dogged him. he faced an uphill battle in a province that has banned civil servants from wearing religious symbols through bill 21 because he proudly and appropriately wears religious symbols himself. under him, the party holds just one quebec seat.

this is an interesting point i haven't seen other comments bring up. the simple fact of being sikh and wearing religious apparel holds him back in a crucial part of the country where the banning of religious apparel is supported by the public and is living in defiance of. quebec is important for any smaller party to have a base in because the bloc does have a healthy base there and siphons votes from the lpc and the cpc. making the dual monolith of the two major parties smaller and seats more attainable as a result.

appointing singh as party leader when quebec is already so important just seems like a lapse in logic. maybe they were hoping to stir up the rest of country's far left progressives, but they're both a tiny minority and seem to be split between the ndp and lpc anyway. when strategic voting kicks in to make sure the cpc stays out, the logical choice for these voters is to vote lpc.

if you only look at the numbers from the top down, sure a proportional representation system makes sense. 

but the problem with a proportional representation system is that it is too top down. so you want to have the number of seats match the overall number of votes. so how would it be decided which specific person sits in those seats? the party decides? so now who has all the power? the party leadership, since they're the ones that choose which specific people that sit in those seats.

so a proportional representation system concentrates power entirely in the party leadership. do you like political parties that much that you want to give power entirely to the party leadership?

now consider why the liberals win elections. they make an effort to find community leaders, people already well known and respected within their communities and try to recruit them into their party. those mps have the ability to leave the party if they don't like what it's doing. which means the party leadership have to listen to them. all of that goes away in a proportional representation system. the dynamic is flipped. if the party doesn't like an mp they just replace them, no by-election necessary, because the seat belongs to the party, not the mp.

also, a few thousand votes can shift the results of a riding. it isn't going to significantly shift the vote nationwide though. because of this, mps are more likely to listen to their constituents in a first past the post system than in a proportional representation system. in fact the mps in a proportional representation system only really care about being higher on their party's list because that's the most significant factor for whether they'll keep their job. who cares if a few thousand people lose their job in some town? it's not really going to impact the result of the next election, right?

so yeah, first past the post sucks. proportional representation sucks even more when you think about the power dynamics. my mp needs my vote to keep their job, and in turn the party needs my mp to stay within their party if they want *their* vote. that dynamic doesn't exist in a proportional representation system.",liberals

there are two ways \"voted for the status quo\" works, however. the first is acknowledging that we only really get to vote for our local mp. there were very few ridings changing hands. most voted the same way they did last election, i.e. for the status quo in terms of local representation, which—in aggregate—means the status quo overall.

the other sense is that there wasn't a big movement of people voting strategically to change things. there certainly wasn't a move to hold your nose and vote liberal because people wanted a majority government, and there also wasn't a move to hold your nose and vote conservative because you want the liberals out, either. the lack of a powerful abl movement is evidence of at least a grudging acceptance of the status quo overall.",liberals

the vaccine reduces symptoms and potentially keeps those most at risk from dying, no denial on that, but i agree that vaccinated and non-vaccinated alike are mutating it, constantly. that's how viruses work and we're not fighting the virus, we're only fighting the spike protein, which give the virus more opportunity for mutation. the corona virus is not going anywhere. you just have to weigh your chances of catching the virus randomly in your environment and dying of it with your chances of dying for a multitude of other reasons because of regular injections of the spike protein as this becomes an, at minimum, yearly thing.

care facilities are lonely death traps that i don't wish upon anyone and it sickens me that it is the supported choice by our tax dollars. society is so broken now that more and more live out the end of their lives with strangers just because they are also old and with care providers who quickly lose their passion because they have no commitment to you and they have regulations and schedules.

hb0opc1,2021-08-30T14:16:05.000-07:00,"the poll thread - tuesday, august 31, 2021 so ridings are what ultimately decide who forms government. there are 338 ridings (or districts) across the country. each riding has a slate of candidates from various parties trying to win said riding. the candidate with the most votes in a riding wins &amp; becomes a member of parliament in the house of commons. to simplify it, the party with the most elected candidates under their party banner wins the election (aka they win the most seats). a party can win a majority (170+), or a minority (more seats than any other party but not the majority of seats). 

now, most of the polls that we see are nationals polls (the entire country). these polls can be fairly accurate at the national level (overall), but regionals can be a little harder to predict due to smaller sample sizes in each area (provinces, regions, etc.).

mainstreet releases both a national poll everyday, and a more targeted riding poll each day. these riding polls are interesting because we get a more detailed look at a specific “district”, rather than a province or region as a whole.

mainstreet has this weird issue where their riding polls and national polls show completely different races. similar to 2019, mainstreet is showing a struggling liberal party nationally, but their daily riding polls have been showing really good numbers for the liberals.

in 2019, these numbers (national and ridings) ended up converging at the end of the campaign - the national numbers ended up reflecting what the riding polls were showing. we’ll see if that happens again here.

this was a very quick explanation, so my apologies if it doesn’t make much sense lol.",liberals

i have two best guesses as to what's going on, and they're a little different. first is just a bit of rational self awareness among their potential voters. some of them might see that even though jag will cut them more and bigger cheques, he's not really in a position to win, so by sticking with the libs they have a higher chance to assure a still very generous on going payout.

secondly, and what i think is more plausibly at work, because i doubt the left's ability to have that kind of coldly rational analysis of their options, is that canada is not as left as advertised. yes for sure the liberals are running on the left now, but they haven't always and they won't always. a large percentage of their voters simply believe in liberal exceptionalism. there's probably a lot of people who think what the liberals are doing isn't entirely to their taste, but they're willing to go with it for now because that's the recieved wisdom from the party. and they'll never be tempted by the \"just do what the liberals say, but two steps to the left\" tactics that the ndp have been deploying in the post-mulcair era. i think the ndp itself are potentially evidential of this fact. the only time that they had power on the tips of their fingers was when they shifted dramatically to the right.",liberals

it's a tough reality, but if you really want seats in quebec, adherence to their laws pertaining to public servants is probably a good first step.

so the ndp isn't allowed to make spending promises until *after* they form government and they've successfully raised taxes? why are the liberals allowed to make tax promises without \"proving\" them? in 2015, trudeau made billions of dollars worth of infrastructure spending promises *and* promised to raise taxes. 

&gt; 2) provide far more details in their plans then they otherwise do. they rarely provide details - which the liberals are way better at doing. this makes it easier to show whats possible.

can you provide some examples where the liberal platform was detailed snd the ndp's wasn't? 

&gt; 3) don’t force federalism on quebec. tell them you’ll work with like-minded premiers to publicize long term care homes rather then force it (some provinces with fully public ltcs &gt; no provinces with fully public ltcs

i agree that singh has done a poor job squaring his activist socialist agenda with quebec's desire for provincial autonomy in the area of social services.

&gt; 4) reconnect with labour roots. it’s uncomfortable to talk about but there are major issues with labour’s trust in the ndp and much of labour now prefers liberals.

can you give an example of one of these \"major issues?\" 

some unions (like unifor) are more supportive of the liberals (especially in ontario), but i'd argue that's simply because they're more successful electorally.

&gt; 5) scrap the wealth tax they can dodge. it’s worthless. what we need is a land value tax that scales on each additional holding after your primary residence. the more homes you get the more $$$ you pay. 10% of the wealthiest canadians own multiple properties, usually moe then a mere handful, and this will either force them to sell and increase available supply of fund social programs

a wealth tax is a vote-winner. there's no reason the ndp should drop it, even if it would \"only\" raise a few billion dollars. 

property is taxed at the provincial/local level. federal intervention in this area would cause problems. if the ndp unilaterally promised this, they'd be accused of encroaching on provincial jurisdiction.",liberals

hhegs2x,2021-10-20T05:43:41.000-07:00,opinion: how should the rest of canada react to alberta’s equalization referendum? by ignoring it they did! harper just screwed up the consultation process enough for it to get shot down in court. fed has jurisdiction but they all have to follow the law. this left trudeau with the really *really* thankless job of having to rejig the process to pass the courts.,liberals
hhehte3,2021-10-20T05:50:22.000-07:00,"mainstreet research poll: 47% of albertans support independence, 53% wish to remain i’m in the camp that albertans, along with all provinces need to tweak equalization, and shift more power to provinces ( which they have strong jurisdiction imo anyways) from the fed, but i am a firm believer in canada, the federation, and the crown.

alberta separating would only be successful if it joined the us, but at this point it would be a hard sell for americans, and would only pass under a republican majority in all 3 chambers. 

america has been debating statehood of other territories for years now, i doubt they would risk creating tensions the region to add a former canadian province among their political turmoil —at least it seems most canadians don’t seem to hate each other as much.

plus believing joining the us with would be mean an economic boom for alberta oil and gas, is a bit silly in this market.

but it would be a win for social conservatives!",conservatives

like when people said bernier is likely vaccinated. it wouldn't surprise me if he actually wasn't.

maybe they start as pandering, but they end up actually believing what they say.
