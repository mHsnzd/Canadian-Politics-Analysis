source? as in 2015 the supreme court recognized that the right to strike is \"fundamental\" and \"constitutionally protected\". [from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strike_action#cite_note-23)
&gt;justice rosalie abella ruled that \"[a]long with their right to associate, speak through a bargaining representative of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer through that representative, the right of employees to strike is vital to protecting the meaningful process of collective bargaining...\"

[back-to-work legislation may come back to haunt justin trudeau](https://theconversation.com/back-to-work-legislation-may-come-back-to-haunt-justin-trudeau-107779) - an article from when the liberal forced postal workers back to work in 18'

&gt;in arriving at the conclusion that the charter of rights and freedoms protects the right to strike, the supreme court found in both 2007 and 2015 that there was an inseparable relationship between meaningful collective bargaining and the right of workers to withdraw their labour.

&gt;in the landmark 2015 case in favour of the saskatchewan federation of labour, the court also determined that workers needed a credible threat to withdraw their labour in order to meaningfully exercise their right to collectively bargain.

&gt;while the supreme court has conceded that governments can interfere with constitutionally enshrined labour rights in order to maintain essential public services, it’s also established a pretty high threshold for governments’ ability to unilaterally take away these rights.

i'm an accountant not a a lawyer so i'm just going off previous disputes and coverage of them so would love to read more if you could provide anything. i do know that previous bills at the provincial and federal level have been found to be unconstitutional.

&gt;overall, this legislation does not frustrate the collective bargaining process, so a court would likely find it a reasonable infringement of the right to strike.

i'm not sure how restricting strike action doesn't frustrate the collective bargaining process since withholding labour (striking) is a key bargaining tool for workers.

it's also worth noting that reform party's 1993 surge was a perfect storm of bad luck for the federal progressive conservatives that likely won't repeat itself:

* the gst was new and extremely unpopular
* meech lake and charlottetown's failure eroded their support in quebec.
* the early 90s global recession hit the canadian economy and the skyrocketing unemployment rates put incumbent governments all around the world in tenuous positions during national elections. a huge fall in oil prices also alienated voters in western canada who were increasingly feeling alienated by the federalist parties in ottawa.
* the campbell government ran an abysmal campaign during the 1993 election that further diminished their standing in the polls.

you likely could not repeat that set of circumstances again in a way that would make a similar vote split for the cpc possible. if it were that easy to cause a vote split, we would have already seen massive uptakes for the ppc and maverick's polls numbers. additionally, most centrist and paleoconservative conservatives both are very afraid of a situation like 1993 happening again, which would ensure liberal majorities until the next \"unite right\" push (though the cpc might have to deal with that anyways if it keeps electing leaders like o'toole or scheer).",conservatives

when dealing with a powder keg issue like china, you have to be careful to not have it blow up in your face. you also have to be careful to ensure it doesn't somehow become your problem solely while others just sit back and watch the fireworks. (which they will, at first at least.)  


it's akin to letting someone hang themselves via their own actions; whilst also not supplying any rope either. you are giving them every chance to change their ways, but while also (ideally) not enabling them at all in any negative fashion. we've basically been playing this game for about 20 years or so now with china; possibly longer.   


we as a country have tried to help china in the past. tried to be trade partners with china. ignored a lot of china's growing pains, while also trying to keep them accountable. by some people's standards, things were going rather well... at least until about the year 2010 or so. it's all been downhill ever since then, if not before.   


what once was a nation with promise of mutual cooperation with canada in the past, has quickly reverted and regressed heavily back into some of its more, questionable practices at best. it has an emperor again; and an appetite for conquest and supremacy.

and it would be 100% warranted.

i remember when the lpc, ndp and their voter bases criticized harper for being authoritarian handed in his style of governance. what happened, do people not hold any form of ideological consistency anymore? when harper was suggesting clamping down on rights to stop \"extremism\", people rightfully explained how by his logic, it could easily turn into a slippery slope and anything and anyone can be banned for any opposition to the government. now the same people have replaced \"extremism\" with \"hate\" and came to the same conclusion? what??? both extremism and hate are bad (they're the same exact thing... except harper had radical imams in mind while trudeau has parler users), they chose those examples because everyone disagrees with hate and extremism! but should we be banned from leaving our houses because we could do bad things outside? no! the best way to stop both of these is to provide people with open dialogue, community support, and a diversity of opinions so they can see the other side. de-radicalization is best done when people are taught how to get out of it, not when we throw away our rights! people can already under the current laws go to prison for threatening people online or engaging in extremist content (good), the ones that are too deep in can already be isolated from society. we are throwing away our rights when we already have the tools to clamp down on this. we don't have this attitude on drugs anymore for a reason.

i’d say it’s more of an acknowledgement that until you can afford to replace high carbon emitting devices (like, your car) that carbon emissions are an inelastic good. 

as somebody who likes the carbon tax i still acknowledge the inherent flaw is it also acts as a redistribution scheme that disproportionately benefits those living in cities that can take public transit or walk to work.

remember when the stay at home orders started, and there were all those news stories about people who lived in rural areas and couldn't do their work because their internet sucked? or the many interviews with parents who would have to drive half an hour in to town to park in a school parking lot so that their child could do online learning and complete their homework?  add on to that rich people deciding to leave the city for their cottages, and then being annoyed that their unreliable internet made working from the cottage difficult.

how do you improve internet in these rural locations? it requires infrastructure investment. and that means that you need the big telecom providers to spend money.

so they have a choice: a) take steps to lower rates for existing internet, which benefits people in cities who already have access to high speed internet, or b) take steps to extend high speed internet to people who don't already have it, which requires a lot of financial investment that telecoms won't make if their revenues have dropped significantly. the pandemic shifted their priorities from the former to the latter.",liberals

however he wouldn't win leadership so it doesn't really matter. but i don't think he'd shift right if he did, i think he'd be more likely to be firm on climate change and lgbt+ rights, and let the further right people leave/party split so he could take plenty of liberal/green voters. writing that really looks funny i'll admit... but i truly dont see him shifting right on the issues that have gained o'toole and scheer accurate criticism.",conservatives

&gt;the refusal to ban travel from virus hotspots was always used as an example of a failure of policy, something that makes a lot of sense but that the liberal government and the who refused to support, not as the only thing that could or should be done even with regards to travel.

he had nothing else. looking backwards, we get more data and have better ideas. like masks. looking back and insisting someone doing a hard job fall on their sword over a absurdly wrong point isn't very constructive. other countries tried that very same tactic. didn't work out for them. we knew that by then. 

&gt;you are choosing to mischaracterize it that way because it's the only way to defend the position you are defending.

he had nothing, you have nothing. you have brought the 'other ideas' he had at the time. he also was critique past action and his alternative was the thing that we know is a definitive failing tactic.

&gt;you changed your tune on the who. one minute, their advice is supposed to be the absolute scientific truth all should listen, the other it is a compromised organization providing for poor recommendations because it is constrained by stakeholders. the two cannot be true at the same time, yet you claim both simultaneously in an admirable example of compartmentalization.

not one inch. reread. they are a repository that makes recommendations after vetting through all their stakeholders. at no point did i say they are the absolute scientific truth as science doesn't work that way, i suppose if that's your understanding i can see how your position are so deficient. they are the organization collecting the data and members pay for that. they also get to control the message, that includes canada and the eu. 

&gt;i don't think i will continue this conversation. there is nothing to gain here from someone who mischaracterizes what other people say constantly, refuses to correct these mischaracterizations when they're pointed out and thinks insults are arguments. i will remove notifications from this conversation and will not bother to read what you write.

sure, the pcs eventually earned a well-deserved landslide under mulroney, but that was *16 years later*.

&amp;#x200b;

* it's amusing and borderline /r/selfawarewolves when i see the literal editor of the financial post and the national post cite an anonymous healthcare professional complain about media reporting on vaccine deliveries.
* she is lying when she says canada is the only developed state to take this first vaccine dose strategy to such an extreme. finland most certainly is, and it can be generally argued that any state that has a first to second shot ratio greater than 4-1 is as well which includes significantly more developed states is pursuing a similar strategy.
* she deliberately ignores that studies show than a single dose does provide substantial immunity to covid-19 when she tries to paint fully vaccinated as the only metric that matters.
* she conflates \"quebec is considering\" and \"quebec most definitely is\" vaccine mixing as an attempt to both shit of quebec while also ignoring that there is an actual study ongoing with oxford concerning the issue. she then tries to make it sound as somehow this is trudeau's personal decision.

overall, it's kind of amusing that these are the last few straws she's able to grasp at as canada's vaccine rollout in was impressive in april, doubling how many were vaccinated at the end of march, and looks to improve to \\~55% vaccinated by the end of may.",liberals
gvzzieg,2021-04-26T11:11:02.000-07:00,"o'toole says stopping flights from india 'not enough,' suggests halting all international travel “expect” isn’t the same as actually knowing. i also expect it to block transmission but until we can actually prove it blocks infection (not just with israel because that’s just correlation and not provable causation) we can’t say it’s because people who are vaccinated can’t transmit it. they may be able to transmit it but just at a reduced level or they may not be able to transmit it at all, which would both lead to lower caseloads in israel like what we see. they may be able to transmit it the same as everyone else but because almost half of people are immune we would see low caseloads since people aren’t contracting it, just passing it around like a game of hot potato.

“they don’t know” means that, despite what they expect, there isn’t concrete proof, not that it’s 50/50. until there’s concrete proof it would be foolish to change policy based on what’s hypothesized over what there’s concrete evidence for. that’s what science based policy means and i understand that it’s frustrating and feels redundant and annoying, but that’s the nature of science. it would be false to say they do know because they don’t. they’re pretty sure but pretty sure doesn’t cut it.

for an example of what policy based off of what’s expected looks like, take thalidomide. on paper and in lab tests it should have just helped morning sickness because it didn’t cause any adverse effects in mice and it did help with morning sickness. little did we know that due to our slightly different physiology the drug undergoes a structural change in humans that doesn’t happen in lab test species and in humans it caused babies to be born without limbs. this is a similar situation. we can expect that the vaccine will stop transmission because most vaccines stop transmission, but until we have concrete evidence that can’t be explained away by something else, we have to assume that vaccinated people can still get others sick to prevent those illnesses.

edit: the facts right now are that increased immunization lead to lower caseloads in israel, the trick now is figuring out how the vaccine is doing that. is is making people immune but they can spread it? is it because they’re immune and also can’t spread it? probably the second one but we can’t say yet and as frustrating as it is we just gotta hurry up and wait for the studies to conclude, data to trickle in, and analyses to be performed.",conservatives

in fact they go up every two years by about as much as we produce as a nation.  you can spout whatever bullshit you like but at the end of the day as long as that's the case it doesn't matter, does it. nothing we do makes the slightest difference.

otoole will scrap the childcare agreements (every province govt gets $0)

he will put in the federal tax credit for childcare (every primary parent for tax purposes gets access to the credit who has a kid in canada)

he will then *also* give quebec government the $6b that trudeau promised them for childcare.

arbitrarily let's pretend child care program would cost $6b per province for the sake of simplicity.

so under trudeau's plan every province gets $6b to create a $10 a day daycare program. since quebec has a program already, to be fair in terms of provincial transfers they also get $6b. everyone gets an equal cut. 

under otooles plan every parent/couple gets a refundable tax credit to help pay for child care instead. no province gets $6b. but since quebec already has a program and the tax credit is federal the parents get that too on too of the qc program. and then *also, he gives quebec* $6b because ... reasons. everyone's deal for a transfer is ripped but not quebec's.

so no they aren't giving the same to everyone. they are giving extra money to quebec because they were flopping on its availability in the debates and it hurt his polls i guess.",liberals

try saying you're a fiscal conservative that doesn't believe in trickle-down economics, and watch the confusion unfold. 

also, \"pick yourself up by your bootstraps, work hard and you'll be rewarded\", is another favourite tagline fiscal conservatives echo.

what the other person said about 4 years isn't true. that's the maximum possible length (well, it's a bit more complicated - this coming parliament will have a maximum length of 4 years and a month). in the case of a majority, the opposition won't be able to vote the government down (unless it's a tiny majority and government mps miss the vote or something), but the pm can still request the governor general dissolve parliament whenever they want. and the answer from the governor general is all but required to be \"yes\". the pm can also request the dissolution during a minority, of course - that's why we're having an election. 

for example, we had elections in 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2004 despite the liberals being elected to a majority in those first three elections and the maximum length of parliament at the time being a full 5 years. 

decent rule of thumb though is that a minority will last a couple of years. harder to say for a majority - when the maximum was 5 years, they generally still called an election after 4.  now the maximum is \"the third monday in october in the 4th calendar year after the last election\". the full term was reached for harper and trudeau's terms, but there's no guarantee that'll continue to be the case.",liberals

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/article-millennials-take-their-place-powering-the-property-market/

&gt; in the past year, in the midst of the pandemic, ms. loh and mr. holmes became part a trend: millennial-age people driving the property market. 

&gt; millennials may not be quite so shut out of the property market as has been reported over the past few years. the cohort, whose age range is somewhere between late 20s to early 40s, is entering a phase of life where they are settling down and thinking about kids. real estate industry observers in the vancouver area say that millennials have been driving a super hot real estate market. the onset of the pandemic could have seen the market move in the opposite direction. instead, within months the market picked up steam.

the issue is, of course, not *all* millennials are in this group.  but certainly there's enough to be driving a noteable market spike.  tech-savvy millennials are taking advantage of opportunities that pre-pandemic folks didn't have.  ie.  'working from home.'  the tele-commute.  this is what has absolutely flooded our small town and rural markets in canada.  particularly in bc, where it's pretty much impossible now to find affordable renting in those towns.

https://www.westerninvestor.com/british-columbia/uvic-students-battle-crazy-rental-shortage-4268284

$1000 per month for a dorm-like shared bedroom in victoria amid shortages.  used to be $600.

https://globalnews.ca/news/7896492/penticton-family-okanagan-rental-crisis/

virtually no rental vacancies in the okanagan.

https://www.tricitynews.com/bc-news/forecast-bc-home-prices-soar-as-supply-falls-4264811

but they're going to focus on building rental housing in 2022.

&gt;the bcrea said b.c. housing starts will plunge 12.8 per cent next year, compared to 2021, to 39,000 units. the drop will be led by the multi-family sector, where starts are forecast to fall 16.8 per cent to 28,300 homes.

&gt;many of the multi-family starts, however, will be rental housing or subsidized social housing, not market condominiums or townhomes.

but in turn family home prices will continue to rise in bc as there won't be enough supply there either.

population growth in bc and the rest of canada is putting the squeeze on everyone while we all become more accustomed to living with less property per person.

edit:  meanwhile, another factor leading to the crunch:  trades labour shortage.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/students-urged-to-go-into-trades-as-industry-faces-labour-shortage-1.6165774

it was mumbled about prior to the pandemic, but now it's sounding alarm bells.  the pandemic has also exposed a potential collapse in trades labour due to retiring skilled tradespersons and millennials not filling the gaps because they've all been told to shun trades.  and no it can't all be filled up by foreign workers.

but if you go into trades it's an absolute windfall:   demand for skilled trades means salaries there will shoot through the roof while the demand for corresponding student loan debt isn't nearly there as it is for non-trades education for jobs that either aren't there or will pay substantially less.

if millennials are going to inherit the earth, then it's time for them to wake up and roll up their sleeves.",liberals

on the amount of money we’ve printed to finance this, dollar for dollar, our asset purchasing/debt financing is right alongside the uk, the us, and to a lesser extent, aus. when i did the math last august, the bank of canada held assets of $542b for an economy the size of $1.7t, so $0.31 per economy dollar is held by the boc. the us is at $0.33 and the uk is $0.30. the eu is near $0.50 and swiss and japan &gt;$1.00.

but here's the thing, i don't mind consumption taxes.  i don't care about taxing us in different ways, and i am not against a carbon tax.  i'm just not deluded thinking it will save the environment when it absolutely won't.  its the weakest thing any jurisdiction can do, its more than weak, its ineffective!   the major problem with it is though that people think it works - they are placated into thinking they are doing something because they support a carbon tax to save the environment.   every country that has reduced emissions has done so by regulation, and with regulation, enforcement.  and secondly through innovation.  it is regulation and innovation that can help the environment.

the truth is in bc the only cuts in emissions have to do with innovation in aluminum smelting, but even those realized cuts hasn't been enough to stop the rise in bc emissions despite an ineffectual carbon tax.   and i say ineffectual in regards to saving the environment, its an effective revenue stream.  and i am okay with it being a revenue stream.  but its an evil tax, if people honestly believe it will help with emissions - it hasn't and it will never help.   ontario realized their emissions cuts through innovation, phasing out old technologies and some regulation.

carbon taxes are fine taxes - they aren't an environmental tool at all.  there is no proof.  the proof is that because bc only did a carbon tax in 2008 and they have rising emissions since, is the only proof in the world that carbon taxes do jack shit.  had bc regulated and enforced, they would have realized emissions declines.   had they regulated and enforced at the same time they would have helped the economists keep up the myth that carbon taxes are effective environmental policy.

and bc is canada's biggest exporter of coal.  its bc's second biggest export i believe.   so fuck bc pretending to be an environmental messiah - they are the problem.  they hide behind a carbon tax to virtue signal just like pipeline buying trudeau.",liberals

hbtnf6l,2021-09-06T02:18:45.000-07:00,"home ownership is becoming a lost cause and the liberals did worse than diddly squat my only issue with this analysis is that it's a little flawed by recency bias.

the facts of the matter are:

1) housing is largely not within the federal jurisdiction, and the biggest pieces that are there, aren't going to help. 

(the interest rates are rock bottom, this makes it easier to service debt, but that's a bank of canada thing, and not a political government thing - plus it's one knob that hits every part of the economy not just housing. the things the feds can control easily are all demand side, with the exception of lowering risk through a stricter qualifying policy in regulated banking but this can and is not used by alternative lenders like credit unions)

2) the largest levers with most impact on supply are provincial (and municipal) and they have been the ones doing nothing. one can argue that federal funds could be set aside for provinces to access and use to spur supply but provinces haven't been asking for it and they don't like money with strings most of the time.

3) the issue, on a national scale, is very new. it doesn't matter that the liberals have held power for 6 years. before covid no one was complaining about housing to the extent they are now outside of a couple of markets. 

this all being said, i'm glad it's on the federal election radar. i'm hoping it means it's also on provincial and municipal election radars too for the next more local cycles. 

but at the same time no one was talking about it last election. even the ndp who did talk about it and ended up in 4th party position behind the bloc were only taking about it in specific policy statements about bc and the vancouver/victoria regions and the gta in ontario

so let's not pretend that it's been a significant issue for a lot of voters for a long time. it's been bubbling in places outside gva gta, and it's was starting to be a concern in ottawa, mtl, halifax, but it wasn't everywhere. now it's near every market and that's why it's an issue. the fact we've all been stuck inside so much has also made people much more aware of how much living in a shoebox really sucks when the tradeoff for that shoebox of being out and about and having a more not-home lifestyle is all taken away.",liberals

democracy is a system of government in which the people have the ultimate decision making authority, either through elected representatives or directly through plebiscites.  it can take numerous forms, and different people are going to prefer different incarnations.

the fact that the losers don't get a seat doesn't make a system undemocratic.  the fact that there *is* a loser doesn't make a system undemocratic.

but i’m curious to see how this’ll be received by its intended target: suburban voters in ontario and bc. it feels like the plan was tailor made to specifically those voters; you know, the ones who don’t care about big government, like direct money policies (cerb, ccb), and pretend to care about climate change but don’t really want to spend any of their own money fixing it.

we really can't underestimate how impactful the us is on our politics. we are living in a world loosely outlined and planned in this 1971 powell memo, which emphasizes among other things, how corporations can turn the growing tide of social progress of the 60's (women's groups, gay advocacy, black power movements, etc).
https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/democracy/the-lewis-powell-memo-a-corporate-blueprint-to-dominate-democracy/

i feel that this is all related to our politics now, we want bold action, we want positive change. we don't get anything, it's all mitigation, virtue signalling, and identify politics (both sides), while ignoring the structural problems. 

last year, we had trudeau ban plastic straws for example, this is like 0.003% or something of waste in the ocean, what does this achieve? on the other hand we have a party that can't even put climate change is real in their platform, not what to do, just it's validity overall, something which oil companies knew and proved over 50 years ago!

i disagree, a balanced budget is a necessary measure to prevent negative ramifications of large debt loads.

ignoring the deficit can lead to a host of issues, including, but not limited to:

- lower productivity; more investment provisions go towards bonds and securitization, leading to lower liquidity for private investment and debt provisions, itself directly correlated with lower productivity

- lower income/wages; the latter have a causation relationship with productivity, which decreases with large deficits, as employers do not receive a justifiable labour output versus labour costs

- lower long term employment; lower purchasing power and less productivity leads to slowed growth for employers, thus less capital investment and lower employment rates

- less capital access for small businesses; a direct product of greater capital allocation for government debt, financiers would be less inclined to provide financing to higher risk clients

- lower incentive to work; we can (partially, labour market is quite complex) already see this as worse credit accessibility leads to lower wages

- higher taxes/less of other programs; this one is iffy, given macroeconomic events such as inflation and growth. however, considering the volume and quality of our debt, it's very likely future financing will be at a premium and more and more a part of the federal budget

- lower credit rating and access to credit as a government; fitch already downgraded canada, and s&amp;p and moody's said they would downgrade canadian debt should we follow a similar trajectory

- inability to address sudden events; should another covid-esque issue pop up, canada would be unable to cough up an adequate budget without sever ramifications due to prior debt levels

- inflationary pressure; lower productivity leads to lower exports, a devaluation of the cad, added with new liquidity (in this case paired with high velocity) can cause or exacerbate inflation

going into the pandemic, norway was ruled by a coalition of 3 right-wing parties under prime minister solberg of the conservative party. today, the conservatives are in first place in the polls at 26% with labour behind at 21%. if that holds up until this fall's election, labour's 100-year streak of winning the most seats will be history.

when i was younger, i was involved in partisan politics with the ndp. i remember canvassing and going door to door for the ndp and ondp and my own anecdotal experience was that there are many people who vote differently at the federal level than they do at the provincial level. additionally, although it is mostly anecdotal i've got a lot of family in ontario that vote liberal (or green federally) and pc provincially.

as for the abc-types, i remember them very well. those strategic votes often benefited the liberals to the detriment of the ndp. i remember arguing with this dude until he and i were red in the face (in hindsight, i was never going to change his mind lol) that a vote for the ndp wasn't a vote for stephen harper but rather a vote for what the ndp represented; that you didn't have to vote against something, you could vote for something instead.

i think the small business tax reform attempts were instructive.  that effort was a set of policy reforms that would have increased taxes on business-owning professionals (lawyers, dentists, etc) to that approaching equivalent wage-earners, but a summer of intense lobbying combined with morneau's deficit of charisma killed it.

once they become implementable policy, wealth taxes will face the same kind of lobbying.  you'll see saskatchewan family farmers, for example, brought out to claim that a wealth tax would kill their family farm (on account of land values).  doctors will claim they'll sell their practices and retire.  ctf-types will misrepresent the policy to seniors to claim that the government is coming for their homes (if they live in a single-family detached house in the middle of vancouver that was purchased in the 1960s).

&gt; i might be confused by what you mean here, but isn't this just property tax?

i was thinking more along the lines of marking home equity to market and assessing the gain or loss as realized income.  that's exactly what would happen with a global wealth tax above a certain threshold.

&gt; when i talk to liberal voters i know, the number one motivation seems to be avoiding a conservative government. the second factor is that most people simply don't track policy that closely and think that the liberal government is just doing a lot more than it really is. 

that can explain voters &amp;ndash; we're all the weird ones here in that we spend more than five minutes a week thinking about politics &amp;ndash; but it doesn't really explain the liberal youth wing that is the source of these policies.

&gt;  the government could implement universal pharmacare, implement an employer-side payroll tax of roughly equal cost and regular people would barely know the difference. 

oh, they'd know the difference.  the opposition and associated lobby groups would spend barrels of ink on how the government wanted to tax \"the hard work of canadians,\" how the evil liberals want to take away your benefits, and how pharmacare is really a way to take grandma's medication out of her mouth (by over-stretching any restriction such as default-generic substitution, or non-coverage for experimental drugs).

look at the opposition to the cpp expansion as the model here.  hell, intergovernmental cooperation would even make things worse; quebec for example would likely demand federal money on a no-strings-attached basis because it already has (insufficient, by pharmacare standards) ramq coverage.

_once implemented_ the policy would probably become an invisible part of the status quo, but in my opinion that implementation would take the better part of a full mandate, both in time and political capital.",liberals

sometimes party brands/labels are misleading, and they're certainly less important than actual policies...

if amlo has greens in his coalition, then i'd be interested to know how they feel about his energy policies:

[mexico was once a climate leader – now it's betting big on coal - the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/15/mexico-coal-fossil-fuels-climate-crisis-amlo)

&gt;president andrés manuel lópez obrador, popularly known as amlo, has unveiled plans to buy nearly 2m tons of thermal coal from small producers like rivera. **he also plans to reactivate a pair of coal-fired plants on the texas border**, which were being wound down as natural gas and renewables took a more prominent role in mexico’s energy mix.  
&gt;  
&gt;**not only is lópez obrador betting big on fossil fuels, he is also curtailing clean energy.**  
&gt;  
&gt;the populist president has promoted a vision of energy sovereignty, in which state-run bodies – the oil company pemex and the federal electricity commission (cfe) – pump petroleum and generate electricity. **private players, which have heavily invested in clean energy, are relegated to a secondary role in lópez obrador’s vision – while emissions and climate commitments are an afterthought.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**“instead of thinking of a transition from coal and fossil fuels, he’s thinking of using more coal and petroleum,”** said adrián fernández bremauntz, director of iniciativa climática de méxico, an environmental organisation.  
&gt;  
&gt;“no other g20 country has such abnormal or retrograde energy policies as this government,” he added. “it’s not going to advance us toward our climate goals.”  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;those \\[clean energy\\] auctions stopped after lópez obrador took power in december 2018. **anaid velasco, research director at the mexican center for environmental law, described the new government’s policy as: “i’ll put obstacles in the path of the private sector, which invested most in renewables and i’ll put most of my efforts – and at least 80% of the budget – into fossil fuels.”**

you can view their whole platform [here](https://www.greenparty.ca/sites/default/files/platform_2019_web_update_oct_6.pdf) from the last election. obviously the new one isn't released yet but i doubt it will change a lot. probably just the environmental policies, and stuff like ltc which i have seen annamie paul talking about recently. 

obviously they aren't going to win, as you say. however if we're being honest, \"forming government\" isn't in the cards for the ndp either no matter how much some like to believe it is (and i would prefer it over the liberals or tories myself too). increasing representation of mps is the goal for both parties i think.",liberals

i really don't get this argument.  unless so many of us are such whiny babies that we just can't take it if someone else has something we don't have (yet).  the us has domestic capacity to produce their own vaccines.  good for them, sadly we don't.  we'll just have to be patient.",conservatives

gsze37i,2021-03-31T11:39:59.000-07:00,"editorial: carbon tax not as popular as liberals think &gt; at best you can say a guy who won a prize for some different work also produced some theory modeling carbon taxes. 

his work did far more than that.  you really going to argue that he won the nobel prize in economics for just building a random macroeconomic model?

if you want it straight from the source, here's an interview with his co-winner:

https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.4843029/nobel-prize-winning-economist-says-carbon-taxes-are-the-solution-to-climate-change-1.4854639

&gt; emissions are not flat at all, they're increasing steadily.

[mostly because of an oil and gas boom and rebaselining in 2018](https://thenarwhal.ca/bc-ghg-emissions-2018-climate-targets/) as far as i can tell and [their emissions have dropped everywhere else.](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/sustainability/ghg-emissions.html)

but if you don't like that example, again i offered up the eu ets as well, one of the oldest emissions trading markets in the world.

&gt; the best analysis is that the carbon tax may have slowed growth by between 5 and 10 percent.

at $20/tonne or 4.4¢/l of gas, i would consider that an accomplishment.

&gt; but honestly - you kind of sound like you have a bit of a moving goalpost on what the facts are. 

hardly.  i am just not willing to trade an economic price scheme for wishy washy targets.  look at what the cpc offered the last two elections.

hard phase-outs and interim targets?  i'm onboard for. but to date, the cpc hasn't shown any interest in all that.

&gt; the fact is its almost impossible to get people to take an honest look at the facts as it is. 

because facts can be interpreted differently.  you see a failure in bc.  i see a $20/tonne that held the line during substantial economic growth. 

my other concern here is that tax rebates and grants are always the first things to be cut when budget balancing becomes a priority.  so will i be voting for a system of rebates that lasts a year or two and then gets rolled up because, \"hey.  we gotta balance the budget.\" if that's the case, i'd rather keep the tax.  that's why i said, if an alternative is proposed, i want detailed targets and dates and interim goals they'll commit to.

&gt; so - if you like, yo go ahead and vote liberal despite their constant track record of failure on this issue.

i would rather not.  i want to vote for a government that will cut the deficit and emissions.

&gt; when the economy tanks and austerity measures have to be put in place and things you care about get trashed please remember this conversation.

you should remember this conversation too.  if we fail, 30 years from now you will have to look your kids and grandkids in the eye and tell them that absolutely anything and everything was always more important than climate change, and that's why canada is now taking in millions of refugees from central america in a deal forced on us by the us.  the whole reason the us military studies climate change and why i was offered the program to begin with (while doing two graduate degrees in engineering too)?  because the strategic implications are substantial and profound, and the pentagon considers climate change a serious threat multiplier and accelerator.",liberals
