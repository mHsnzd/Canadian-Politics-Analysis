but to understand the riding, eugene bellemare had won it handily for years for the liberals despite being routinely voted by his peers the lazy mp in parliament.  that despicable mp even published his doodles on his mp website back in the day - because that's what he did when sitting in the house!  doodled!  i recall the last time he stood up in the house was to honour peanuts and charles schultz.

she was briefly our liberal mpp but quit to run for mp when andrew leslie left.  which left us without an mpp for a time - it was an opportunistic move that didn't sit well with me.  similarly, our local city counsellor having been recently elected, quit that to run and win as the new liberal mpp.

i hate the attempts at increasing tribalism in politics in this country. discounting a candidate or party because of the colour of their lawn sign.

i've voted ndp in the past. i'm not tied to any party. i read the platform documents, try to research local candidates and then engage with whoever gets elected. the ndp new policy documents look interesting but i just don't know...for example they have a focus on free public transportation. a lot of canadian cities have such crap transit that even if it was free it wouldn't be worth it. it's a great anti-poverty strategy but i don't know if it would be meaningful towards climate action in this country. and that pretty much sums up what i feel the difference is between the green party and the ndp. i think the ndp does anti-poverty and social justice better. i think the greens do climate better.",conservatives

also i don’t think that makes sense. why are the liberals then going up on the weekends? that would indicate to me that the liberals are the ones tied up and unable to answer the phone on weekdays.

something has to be causing the liberals to dip in the weekdays and rise on the weekends or the cpc to rise on the weekdays and dip on the weekends (or, probably, given the extent of the shifts, both).

brushing your teeth costs a relatively small amount and going to the dentist on the regular for a cleaning &amp; checkup might dock you $120/year.  round up to, let's say $150/year for mouthwash, floss, toothbrushes, the visits, the gas.  that's five billion dollars a year that canadians are collectively spending on looking after their mouths.  generally.

we don't have a conviction that spending that money will guarantee we don't get a cavity and on the flip side, there's a chance that you could skip the $150/year in costs and maybe your teeth will be mostly fine and you'll save money in the long run.

in abstract, that's what we're doing with healthcare.  with schools.  a huge proportion of the cost is simple upkeep (and if you want to talk deficits - we're already in the red on this front in ontario - part of why doug ford is asking for handouts).  anecdotally, yes, you can find bad schools or shitty doctors.  but *in aggregate*?  odds are pretty good that having this as a policy and social practice is saving us all a lot of money and grief.  put aside the fact that, heck, a society where we're brushing our teeth is going to be less stinky in general.  a society where we give our kids public school or keep people healthy is going to be richer and stronger overall.

so how do we know how much to spend?  how do we know how to assess that 'may' i talked about in the first paragraph?  generally there's a fair few people who've made it their calling to study the science, to know the history, to know the facts, and to project for the future.  

you can rip on dentists all day, but are you telling me you're skipping the general costs and upkeep?  does your one bad experience mean you're not going to spend the money on toothbrushes and toothpaste, or getting dental cleanings?  if the consensus of the experts are saying \"hey, dude, if you don't spend more now, you're going to suffer a hell of a lot more later\", i think we should listen to them.

if you want to say we shouldn't listen to the experts, i'm curious who we should listen to.

and honestly, that's what they're saying.  they're saying schools were underfunded before the cuts.  teachers are criminally underpaid.  people all across the board were (and are) saying hospitals were struggling and we had brain drain *before*, then we cut stuff.  *then* covid hit.  again, we're fast approaching a time when a good chunk of our population is going to be having more and more health issues, and that was going to be rough waters before covid.

it would be one thing if there was honest debate or meaningful studies arguing back.  or if the people cutting these things were willing to justify the cuts with more than 'deficit'.  but instead, they ignore the questions and hide like cowards.  they know the facts don't favor them.  to people like ford and kenney and even o'toole, it's politics, plugging their ears to the facts, and the rest of us suffer for the lack of upkeep.  kids suffer, and even the cpc's voting base will suffer.",conservatives

i assume you intended \"*whatever stage of development they're at when they are delivered regardless of whether that's at 21 weeks of gestation or at 42 weeks or later doesn't matter, it's whatever stage they happen to be at when they're delivered*\".   the reason i assume you meant that is that is the only way you could mean it and still maintain your position that a person only begins to exist at birth because that's the variation in when human beings are delivered and live.

but that's not actually a stage of human development.  that's picking a legal outcome you'd like to see and then retroactively insisting that each human being had their own individual \"fully developed\" point which is only known after it happens and which can vary by many weeks.   it's not scientific, it's arbitrary.


&gt; you’ve just created a straw man of my argument

not at all.  i'm asking you why you think a person begins at birth and it seems very much like you think a person begins at birth because you're working backwards from a desired outcome, not forwards from a scientific, religious or philosophical argument.   if your argument was actually based on human development as you say it is, then you'd have to either conclude that some fetuses are human before they're born, (giving full legal rights to fetuses prior to birth) or you'd have to conclude that the human beings who are premature aren't actually people and so should not have the legal rights of a person.	 

your position is full of holes because \"birth\" isn't the stage at which human beings begin or are fully developed, it's just the latest stage at which we can be born given our large brain sizes and the fact that any later date would result in the end of our species and so we evolved for delivering early in our development compared with other mammals.

******************
i've had this discussion with many people over the years and i've generally found that there's two positions that i can't point out such obvious logical flaws even though i may not like them.   

one is that personhood begins mid-way through the fetal development stage which that argument rooted in the appearance of brain structures and activity.  it has the implication that third trimester fetuses are in fact fully persons whose rights should be defended under the law and that scientific implication makes some hard line pro-choice advocates uncomfortable.

another is that personhood begins significantly after birth and that argument is rooted in the more complete development of brain structures and activity.  it has the implication that our cute newborns aren't actually people because their brains aren't all there yet and their rights should be lesser under the law and that scientific implication makes quite a few more people uncomfortable.

the remaining popular choices, (birth and conception), are rooted either in religious revelation or \"i want it to be at this point so i get a preferred legal outcome\" reasoning, neither of which are particularly defensible from a scientific standpoint or indeed to anyone who doesn't share the same very specific assumption.",conservatives

and given that it seems we should have a criteria beyond \"well i want this legal outcome, so i'll say a human being is a person if it gets me the outcome i want\".

this is just saying that it's that way because it's that way.  the question is \"what is our justification for that decision\".   if your answer is \"it's that way because we decided it's that way\", then it follows that any other decision is equally defensible because if we decide another way, then we've decided that way.

i disagree with you completely regarding the future of the grid. decentralization is a truly aweful strategy   for decarbonization because it is both expensive, relies on others to opt in (have capital to invest), downloads the cost of backup to the grid while also lowering the price of energy on the grid making the grid even more price sensitive, doesn't take into account efficiency of scale and does little to address variability of production, and is completely impractical for many climates. for the next decade atleast vre is atleast half natural gas, which isn't good enough. decentralization without planning is one of the factors that killed otherwise economic already operating nuclear in a number of states, leading to more natural gas.

your intentions 15 years ago were in the right place and nuclear may even have succeeded if there wasn't so much fud around but i think the last 10+ years have shown us that the way of the future is decentralized/distributed, scaleable, democratically-owned type systems, rather than complicated/centralized/expensive/private systems. 

even thought i am scientifically and engineeringly on-board with nuclear, as you mentioned the cruel reality of the world is that political will and social will is not there. the window for nuclear to succeed was 1980-2010 but i think this is closing. 

to the issue of your career - it's not too late to pivot. indeed, sooner is always better! don't let the sunk cost fallacy of time already spent, prevent you from making the best decision going forward.

in many of my past jobs, i worked on projects, designing machines, or company processes, or anything else, that eventually got replaced. some products missed their timing in the market, or failed in the market, and you feel shitty that years of work was \"for nothing\". but on the other hand, you got paid, hopefully got some good memories and skills and good times with coworkers. no need to agonize when it's time to move on to newer things.

i looked back to the 2000's or so.  while the elections don't really line up, from what i have seen the ondp usually gets in the single digits to it's high of 33.5% support in 2018.  for a number of elections they did in the middle teens into the low 20's. peaking with the collapse of the olp vote in 2018.  

the federal ndp typically gets around 16%-18% of the ontario vote.  in the 2011 election where jack made his big move, the ndp still only took 22% of the vote in ontario.   

so, for the most part while the ndp is becoming somewhat more popular than they were in the 80's and 90's, their support levels are surprisingly fairly similar.   while the ondp did really well in 2018, due to a massive 18pp drop in olp votes, which the opc and the ondp split fairly evenly.  in 2014, the conservatives also took a 4pp drop in their share, which the ondp gained only 1pp.

wouldn't they just congregate in the essential places then? :) 

lockdowns can slow the spread. but - they're definitely no solution, regardless of which groups you lock down. without a doubt taking extra precautions with the at-risk is critical but there's no way to isolate them completely. and the more infections there are the better the chance of mutations.

1) the chief electoral officer started by altering the election dates for a third of the province’s ridings (which the nl elections act does not give him the authority to do);

2) faced with backlash, he then postponed the election indefinitely (which he does not have the power to do);

3) using authorities he also doesn’t have under the law, he then rescheduled the election, and - contrary to the law - closed all the polling stations and made it vote-by-mail.

4) when some voters had difficulty accessing their ballots, he personally delivered some voting packages *to his neighbours,* while the rest of the province didn’t have that luxury.

5) at least four voters who had difficulty accessing their ballots ended up voting over the phone, which elections nl has itself admitted is illegal.

6) throughout this process, the ceo kept changing the rules for whose votes would be counted. first it was “received by the new election date” (“received by” is the legal requirement). then it was “postmarked by the election date” (not provided for in law). then it was “don’t worry if you can’t send it in time, as long as it’s postmarked by the final deadline, we’ll still count it.”

the chief electoral officer isn’t some mysterious god of elections. they are a servant of the legislature, and their powers come only from the law. a free and fair election depends on a) everyone knowing the rules, b) the rules being subject to the law, and c) the rules being applied consistently.

given all of that, how can a court challenge now not result in a judge ordering a fresh set of election writs?",liberals

&gt;the then-progressive conservative government in st. john’s wanted to push ahead, but the financial burden of muskrat falls was too big for the province. it needed ottawa’s fiscal heft – and the lower borrowing costs to be had by taking advantage of ottawa’s aaa credit rating.

&gt;mr. harper, in the 2011 election, promised newfoundland his support. in late 2012, ottawa provided a $5-billion loan guarantee. a few weeks later, muskrat falls officially moved ahead – even as predicted costs had already jumped to $7.7-billion.

&gt; by 2016, costs had surged to $11.4-billion. the trudeau government threw some more good money after bad, upping the federal loan guarantee by another $2.9-billion.

&gt;canadian taxpayers should never have been on the hook for the many mistakes at muskrat falls. this should have been a purely provincial project. instead, ottawa essentially wrote the province a blank cheque, assuming that it would never need to be cashed. without that federal “help,\" this project might never have gone forward. billions of dollars would have been saved.

gtml3np,2021-04-06T09:13:09.000-07:00,"toronto home prices surge more than 20% as bubble debate heats up i'm going off the [latest available census data](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?lang=e&amp;geo1=pr&amp;code1=01&amp;geo2=pr&amp;code2=01&amp;searchtext=canada&amp;searchtype=begins&amp;searchpr=01&amp;b1=all&amp;tabid=1&amp;type=0). can you link your numbers? i'm curious where this 1% is coming from.

&gt; as far as i can tell, the only reason owning vacant properties is even potentially profitable is if these properties increase in price yoy at an absurd rate, otherwise these properties are not investments that will return money, they are costs.

profitable to whom? the point i've been trying to stress is that we're not all in this for the same reasons. you have to look at the demand side of the equation. there are people in the market to:

a) sit on property and watch it rise the way it has been the last couple years,

b) sit on property in a good/rapidly expanding location and watch it rise regardless of the general market,

c) hold the property as a long-term investment against a rapidly changing na property landscape under climate change,

d) amass as many units as possible as rentals, squeezing tenants to get decent returns, and forcing possible owners to continue renting, and

e) to find a damn place to live.

the last category is your traditional, super inelastic demand that you might expect out of a housing market. all the others are players of various sizes, and the largest are growing as increasingly steady ability to eat up extra supply and wait on it - why wouldn't they? they can count on people like me to always need housing in some form, and they can make a good bet on the long-term viability of canadian real estate through the next few decades, and so they can hold the keys (literally) and charge as an exorbitant a price, in mortgages or rents, as they so feel, driving the rest of us deeper into debt just to put a roof over our heads. that's part of the dual nature of the demand in a unique market like this.

your supply-side solution might work if you gave a big enough boost all at once to crash the market and pop the bubble. not only would this be hugely unpopular and also not great for the working class, i do not believe it's possible for a variety of reasons; most neoliberals drastically underestimate the consolidation of wealth in all sectors of the economy and the size of the supply increase necessary to dislodge any of it.

regardless of the level of supply you want, further housing construction needs to be done in concert with policy that explicitly decommodifies a section of the housing market and makes it available far below today's market price in relation to wages.",liberals

but it's still something to worry about, especially since the radical left has been trying (and oft succeeding) to hijack the liberal party in recent decades.  freedom of speech and expression is absolutely integral to life in a free country, and an elected government of any stripe has no place in deciding what people can or can't say in public.  here's a sort-of excerpt of an email i sent to my local (and liberal) mp,  explaining how this move could very well bite the government in the ass...

we already have checks and balances on our freedom of speech, because rights always come with responsibilities.  if my words cause a public panic or an act of violence, i will have to explain my decision to utter / post them to a court of law.  it's already very illegal to use language to incite violence or panic, and rightly so.  

if the government decides to censor my words (or yours), they also take on all responsibility for failure / refusal to censor them.  that means if i release a tweet telling everyone to attack polish people (just for example) and a bunch of polish people are actually attacked, it's now the government's fault because they didn't censor me.  individual responsibility, another bastion of freedom, goes right out the window.

if the government assumes the role of censor but does not accept the responsibility that comes with it, that's dangerous as hell.  that's exactly what happened in germany in the 1930's, it's what happened in the ussr from the 1910's to 1989, and it's what is happening in china and north korea right now.  there is no such thing as a valid reason to censor freedom of speech.",liberals

lpc virtue signalling aside, what i really worry about though is the absolute myopia in the cpc on how fast the transition is actually going and how fast corporate investment decisions are lining up to cut emissions.  one would think watching the decimation of coal in the us by natural gas would have provided some warning.  but people keep burying their heads in the sand on how much cheaper batteries and renewables are getting each year and the increasing probability that a lot of the developing world that our oil and gas sector was counting on, is going to skip the fossil fuel stage of development.  tell this to people and i often get a strawman about how we can't eliminate fossil fuels.  but the thing is, we don't need to even cut fossil fuels for the economic pain to come.  any confirmation of a secular demand peak is going to massively cut investment evaluations and start a price war for share, bringing real hurt to canada.  i want a government that is actually prepared for such an eventuality, even if canadians aren't ready to talk about it.",conservatives

how much corruption is tolerable is hard for me to say. if it is isolated to specific individuals and only successful as long as it is secret, then i don't consider it a big deal. let law enforcement take care of it (where applicable) or else let party take care of their own if that works. if the corruption is sticky and does not go away even when revealed, then there is a problem.

climate change is an externality. it is a cost to society that isn’t accounted for in the price of goods. this leads to people consuming goods that contribute to it without really taking into account the negative impact it will have. one of the easiest ways to address that is by raising the costs of goods that contribute to climate change, which leads to their market cost being more reflective of the real cost to society. this makes it so a carbon tax is one of the quickest and most straightforward ways to address our emissions.",conservatives

gxqch0r,2021-05-11T00:17:58.000-07:00,"justin trudeau’s liberals have a firm grip on toronto. can jagmeet singh’s new democrats break it? i’m curious, what do you mean when you call yourself a “fiscal conservative”. i hear a lot of slightly right of centre voters make this claim, but it always strikes me as odd.

while i agree that the current fiscal position is quite aggressive in face of the pandemic and it’s yet to be seen whether that will pan out well, i don’t know of many economists that were particularly critical of the fiscal position before covid. i’d also point out that the liberals biggest attempt at logically increasing taxes was met with tremendous backlash and propaganda from the right

i agree though that the if the liberals are to continue they will need to better match revenue to spending post pandemic, hopefully through changes to capital gains taxes or increases at the top end",liberals

&gt;of all the parties, the most amount of single votes went to the cpc, but it was significantly less than 50%+1.

same goes for the liberal party. so can we further presume the _majority_ do not support this bill?

&gt;they are very different, and unfortunately them not having a majority ruins your point that they should be the ruling party.

i have never made this claim.

the person i responded to said that because the liberals are in power the majority of people support this bill.

no offense but this just sounds like grasping at straws to make a point. nobody runs with the promise of forming coalition, but a coalition is formed and that coalition includes more votes than any single party.

i'm sorry, what is your point here? are you telling me governments shouldn't be allowed to do things that isn't part of their platform? that they need a referendum to do anything more? are you telling me that's really how you vote and get mad when your candidates do things that aren't on their platform? which province are you from?

i suspect the majority of people don't understand most bills that get pushed out. jordan peterson and bill c16. reddit and repealing net neutrality. reddit and this bill.

gxqggsb,2021-05-11T00:46:46.000-07:00,"opinion | free speech is not at risk by supporting changes to the broadcasting act even the discoverability point does not control content. guilbeault said that in his message yesterday.

my argument about this whole matter is what happens to the conservative message once it comes out that this doesn't attack free speech and then the charter statement validates the government's argument.

how can geist and others, including jody wilson raybould, claim to be speaking the truth, or her point which was speaking truth to power?! give me a break. the only truth to power she ever spoke was being in a thorn in the side was being against this pm.

not to mention wanting to turf the pm and having a leadership race, and her and philpott wanted to or have one of the two run to become pm in a leadership race. but i disgress.

the fact is this is not an attack on free speech.

it is out and out manipulation.

so again when the charter statement validates the government's position, the opposition will definitely have egg on their faces!

but again it comes down to what the charter statement says. when that comes out, i feel again the opposition parties namely only the conservatives will have had a good run but hopefully will be lambasted for telling lies blatantly and will need to answer for misleading canadians and the media stringing us along.",conservatives
