air canada is forced to be headquartered in quebec by federal legislation. it’d be political suicide for the liberals, but there’s really no point to this level of protectionism in favour of quebec. air canada already does most of its business outside the province, and i’m sure they’d likely move to toronto; it’s already their biggest hub.

alberta and saskatchewan are also the highest ghg emitters in canada but can’t mention that. or the fact that large oil sand companies have been caught lying about their emissions. needless to say when these oil and gas companies do shut down there is no plan to reclaim the land as it will cost billions and alberta will never see that money from the oil and gas companies, it’s more billions we need to eat or trudeau to bail us out.

say you have a nice community that's in a great spot. who votes on how much it gets expanded, what new housing gets built, who gets to move in, etc?

do you leave the decisions to the residents who live there already--the 'haves'? because they'll predictably decide that, nah, we're good, let's leave things exactly as they are. no new housing, no new residents. and it doesn't matter if they're rich, or poor in sweet public housing, they'll almost certainly vote the same way--especially if there's no economic incentive to let people in.

do you include the 'have-nots'? in a sense, that includes _everybody else in the country_, since they all _might_ want to move there if given the chance. how do you filter them, and pick the ones worthy of moving there or having a say in the growth of the community? do you make all decisions at the national level? do you delegate to some bureaucratic body? and if so, how do you pick them?

the market has answers to all of these questions: essentially, you want it, you pay for it. the left haughtily claims that the market does a terrible job...and also has answers to _none_ of these questions. not really. there's debate on every point and disagreement on every solution. a whole lot of the blame for the existing dysfunction the article points out (pretentious new mcmansions next to decaying apartments, say) are due to zoning and regulations, and there's no consensus on how to fix them _now_. increasing the scope and responsibility of government--at a higher level to avoid nimbyism--is going to solve everything? for real?
