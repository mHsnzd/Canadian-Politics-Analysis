gw0fpy5,2021-04-26T13:37:31.000-07:00,"election off the table as liberals survive final confidence vote over budget that was just for votes of confidence after being appointed. there should also be a system to require that they get a vote of confidence to begin with before being allowed to be pm, something the uk lacks. boris failed his very first commons vote, and should never have been allowed to be pm in the first place.

your system opens up blank cheques.

there are a lot of different ways that votes of confidence can be organized, like in germany where the president nominates someone and an absolute majority must approve by secret ballot. if yes, they are chancellor. if not, the bundestag has two weeks to hold as many rounds of voting by secret ballot with an absolute majority needed to approve on nominees proposed by any quarter of the members. the first with an absolute majority is chancellor. if that fails, the next day, a vote is held where any candidate nominated by at least a quarter of the members is put into the ballot paper and each mp votes for one. if one has an absolute majority by secret ballot, they are chancellor. if not, the president decides between making the one with the most votes chancellor or calling a new election.

the opposition can with 25% or more of the members signing the petition to do so, hold a vote of no confidence outlining who should be the replacement chancellor, and an absolute majority is needed to pass by secret ballot, with a time delay of 48 hours, and if it passes, they are automatically chancellor. the chancellor can ask for a vote of confidence at any time but not attached to a bill but only a basic statement of their priorities, and an absolute majority by secret ballot is needed to pass, and if it passes, nothing happens, but if it fails to get an absolute majority, the president decides between holding a new election or tolerating a minority government, and no other way to hold a new election beyond the expiration of the term, four years, the date set by the president in a two month window, exists.

the president has legitimacy in their own right to make these decisions because the president is elected by secret ballot by all the members of the bundestag and an equal number of bundestag members from each state, each state choosing them proportionally to the strength of parties in their own legislature, needing an absolute majority on the first two ballots, the plurality winner on the third ballot if it comes to that, and can be be removed by the constitutional court finding them guilty of violating the constitution or german law on proposal of two thirds of either house of the german parliament. the president does not have a special reason to be loyal to a chancellor, and can autonomously make these decisions in the interest of the whole population.",liberals

the irony for me is a tax in carbon is in line with the small c conservative view of government's role. normally they would be advocating for letting the market decide how to cut carbon emissions and putting a price on its use is the least invasive way to do that. letting companies and consumers figure out how to save money and reduce carbon emissions is a win win and government does not need to tell anyone what to make or what to do.

your asking of need is irrelevant if you agree we live in a free society where i dont have to justify my need to own anything. 

we dont ban cars because of drunk drivers, we dont ban hospitals because of malpractice. 

as for border security i am not talking about trumps stupid ass border wall. also if you take half a second to look you will see many parties and politicians have talked about the need to stop the pipeline of illegal guns from the us which account for between 50-80% of crime guns.

now lets talk the definition of a crime gun which includes airsoft, pellet, and nail guns all of which are purchased in canada or the fact that all it takes is for a gun to be owned by or found at a scene and may have had nothing to do with the crime but is still added all.of which inflate the statistics of how firearms are used in crime.

i will probably never change your mind on this as you have your own horrible life experience as you have described, but you are in the vast minority and there are currently tons of laws already on the books to restrict the very activities you talk about. and tons of methods of reporting including anonymously so you wont be found as \"the rat\". also would you rather have that money that is being used in what will effectively be a useless ban as far as violent crime is concerned go towards support to have gotten you out of the situation you where in. rehab and homeless support better funded so you would never have been in that situation to begin with?

also i am tired of you picking one line and ignoring all the other vast amount of imformation and facts that prove the ban will do nothing. you are cherry picking because you only have feelings and emotions on your side and not the actual facts. there are plenty of countries across the world that allow the owning of these firearms and have no problems like us. our problem is not the guns or the violent crime, those are symptoms and not the diesease. we need to treat the actually parts wrong and quit trying to cover up the symptoms.",conservatives

doing utility work in saskatchewan for instance, the bid evaluations used to be about 50-50 as far as cost and technical weighting of the bids. you might be a little high on cost, but you'd ace the technical portion and could win the work. 

that changed starting early in the wall days. the new crown leadership either implied, or outright stated that contractors and suppliers were getting a free ride. the old bid systems were pretty much thrown out. among the changes, everything was competitive, and price was weighted to up to 75%. 

you get what you pay for. lots of work went to people who couldn't deliver, or who ended up losing money on the project, or they'd substitute cheap material and equipment instead of using the stuff that everyone on both sides knew would actually last.

frankly, anytime conservatives find themselves talking about immigration one of them always manages to say something utterly gross and poisons the well for other well-meaning and reasonable conservatives to make valid points, and until the people who make those gross points are vehemently repudiated, conservatives can't be surprised when people assume their party has a problem with people who are non-white and non-christian.

sports teams were sponsored by the local businesses, not tim horton's. in such a way you started to know the businesses and people in your community. my dad's restaurant was a sponsor for the local junior hockey team. my mom worked at the bank. they knew everyone. my high school graduating class, the only 2 people i didn't know transferred in last semester where i had the afternoon off. it really shaped who i became as a person growing up to the point i moved to  a bigger city and the first gf i got there couldn't believe that whenever we went anywhere we were always running into people i knew. i went to a big music festival with her and my dad one year and my dad, who had been estranged for a while noticed the same thing. we had to stop all the time going between stages. i took that community building aspect and it became a huge part of who i am now, even though i vote ndp not conservative. 

what i'm trying to say, is that i think personal responsibility gets conflated with selfishness because we live in a more globalized community now. we aren't attached to our immediate community. most people are not building a community around them. when you have the community to support and fall back on, personal responsibility is very important. personal responsibility is safe spaces, it's interconnected families, it's the health and well being of those around you. we simply don't have that as a society anymore, particularly with the advent of social media, and identity politics. so because of the smaller communities there's a smaller perceived personal responsibility. 

take for instance the covid lockdowns and safety measures. from a community experience like the one i described earlier, how do i choose two people in alberta to be my community from a lot. do i say to friends with mental issues surrounding trauma, sorry, my life is full of people, i know we normally sit and smoke a joint and you get shit off your chest, but i can't help you with your mental health anymore. my gf and her family have been helping a single mom, who's daughter is her daughters best friend, they've both been sexually abused by her ex husband, but sorry again, the government shut down the courts so a convicted but not sentenced rapist still gets shared custody of a 9 year old girl. not going to happen.

easy to pick my poison. the gap between those in power and the general population, and how it can at times bleed into governance, is minimized through the \"check\" that the electorate places on it in terms of their tolerance level. and i'd *much* rather have a manageable gap that manifests itself from time to time in salient issues, than i would have parties in power that can easily be controlled by their more populist elements.

stephen harper somehow did what brian mulroney could not: he kept the party together after governing for nearly a decade. and he did it by convincing the people holding more extreme views in the party to temper them; that's an intangible skill (or an insanely lucky case of \"the right person for the right moment in time\") that i don't think is just waiting around the corner for them. 

i'm beginning to believe that the conservatives' path back to power may lie in replicating 1993-2004 in accelerated fashion: break up the party, reunite the party under someone with a strong defined vision after another shitty election performance, and have the crazies agree to stay quiet because they've been re-convinced it's the only way they'll ever get any power.",conservatives

we've had much noise about the vaccination plan and restrictions etc. but government has been careful not to say we'll be back to normal once we have widespread vaccination, which may very well just be that the government has bigger fish-to-fry on the messaging front but i'd be lying if i said it hasn't been making me a little nervous, especially when marc garneau said that vaccinated individuals could still spread covid back when he was still transport minister.

paired with that, i haven't ever been able to get a straight answer from my member of parliament on when the government might relax certain restrictions, or what criteria or targets they have for said relaxation.

my personal opinion is that the federal and provincial governments need to quickly get into lockstep on what the exit from pandemic restrictions look like: which ones may have to stick around, and when we can start shaking off the rest. if we don't, i think we're just going to see escalating non-compliance as people become more and more fed up with an information vacuum and make their own choices.",liberals

glzh1uf,2021-02-03T21:31:29.000-08:00,"canada a rogue polluter on the world stage. as countries are accelerating their pollution reduction, canada now pollutes +21% more than in 1990. the us, france, uk, japan, and others are all at even or less. i'm going to provide you with pretty much the same response i sent you last time you brought up the ccpi link.

\\-----------------------------------------------

looking at the ccpi rankings for the last 6 years or so, i think a more nuanced take is required. the ccpi rankings are based on four categories:

* ghg emissions
* renewable energy
* energy use (efficiency)
* climate policy

where canada continues to have issues is the first three. however, canada has had sizeable improvements in the last category over the last several years. in 2015 - which was the last year that harper was in power - the [ccpi had canada in the worst category for policy](https://germanwatch.org/sites/germanwatch.org/files/publication/10407.pdf) (there doesn't seem to be a table that specifically captures rankings based on policy for this year like the subsequent ones, but the sliver allocated to use in the main bar chart is tiny). in 2021, [canada now ranks 29 out of 61](https://ccpi.org/download/the-climate-change-performance-index-2021/). not the best, but well away from the bottom. (as the latest report was published in december 2020, i'm not sure if it takes into account the [recent policy announcements](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/net-zero-carbon-climate-trudeau-1.5838736) that were made in mid-december).

(one aside, i have a few issues on how the renewable energy category is weighted. [82% of canada's energy](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/science-data/data-analysis/energy-data-analysis/energy-facts/electricity-facts/20068) is non ghg emitting - 15% of which is nuclear - , and 60% of that is hydro. having australia higher on the list than us in this category, when it gets like [90% of its energy consumption](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/basics#:~:text=australia's%20primary%20energy%20consumption%20is,around%20(2%20per%20cent)) comes from coal, oil and gas seems a bit off. i think this category is more directed to expansion rather than current use, but that still seems somewhat misleading).

so - could the liberals be doing better on the climate file? for sure. our overall ghg emissions are still high, and we could be doing more with regards to renewable energy and how we use it. however, it appears that gains have been made on the policy side of things, which should have an impact on the other categories (though this may take some time). however, claiming that 'you have' to be abcl voter if you're concerned about the climate or environment is a bit of a stretch, considering the changes in policies over the last several years.",liberals

some things are more important than the world championship for who can run the fastest. i hope that the coc makes the right decision here and boycotts.

quick edit: you've got to be a bit worried about the quality of decision making on this issue when the coc has, for instance, dick pound as a member. dick has been great with wada and related issues over the years, but you have to wonder if guys like him are too invested in the olympic myth after he was claiming earlier this year that we should seriously consider vaccinating olympic athletes ahead of senior citizens.",liberals

the prime examples were 1980s conservative politicians like ronald reagan, margaret thatcher, and brian mulroney.  harper probably fits too.

however, trudeau increased government spending (e.g. transit, child care), cut some taxes but increased others, added more environmental regulations, and nationalized a major pipeline.

you can like or dislike trudeau's record, but it has very little in common with \"neoliberalism\" in the traditional sense (aside from supporting free trade).

(that said, there are online communities who sort of reclaimed the term \"neoliberal\" with a more centrist definition that's pro-immigration, pro-trade, pro-zoning reform, so maybe that's what you have in mind, i don't know)",liberals

neoliberal parties/politicians seem pretty gung-ho on nerfing regulation. (unless you meant having any regulation at all counts as pro-regulation)

neoliberals also tend to be outright against expanding democratic fairness. as exemplified with the liberal party lying about electoral reform and advocating against proportional representation. neoliberals tend to be heavily influenced by lobbys and monied interests. this is not-mentioning the complete shitshow elections are in the usa.

in israel and other countries where they managed to get an extremely high vaccination rate among the elderly they're still dealing with surges and the majority of hospitalizations are vaccinated. the difference in outcomes between the young and healthy vs the old and sick is so drastic that a vaccinated person over 50 is still 3x more likely to end up hospitalized than an unvaccinated person under 50.

if i recall the ruling on prostitution when harper was pm, the ruling struck down prostitution laws against street-selling, brothels, and living on the avails. in response to this ruling, stephen harper's government introduced legislation that didn't necessarily re-criminalize prostitution but rather aimed at criminalizing the purchasing of sex, as well as regulated where prostitution was not allowed such as near schools and places where children would gather. the conservatives adopted rules which were in the spirit of the nordic model; where sex can be sold but not purchased. at the time the conservatives also made it illegal to advertise sex through traditional and social media, as well as certain activities which deliberately attempted to mitigate or control the commercialization of prostitution.

this ontario court ruling seems to be that the latter aspects of the conservative legislation are unconstitutional. the star's article said that:

&gt;superior court justice phillip sutherland ruled wednesday that a set of criminal offences introduced by the federal conservatives in 2014, related to advertising, procurement and material benefit from sex work, are immediately of no force and effect.

i believe this court decision kept the criminalization of the sale and communication of prostitution.

now, i disagree with your categorization of stephen harper and the conservatives' 2014 bill on prostitution. i am generally in agreement with many sex-negative feminists when it comes time to the harms that prostitution poses to women, and find that it can be quite coercive and exploitative of women in the long-term. there are some serious power-dynamic questions. few women sell their bodies because they genuinely want to. many do so out of either coercion, poverty, addiction, etc, etc. my heart weeps for these women, and i view prostitution as violence against women; specifically street prostitution. i would like to do more to help these women and address the underlying issues that lead them to sell their bodies in the first place, and help in a way that makes it so that they never have to do so again.

here is where some nuance comes into the picture for me though. there is a segment of the population that wants to buy sex, and wants to sell sex. i have to accept that, as much as i find it unfortunate. i believe that sex ought to be permissible for purchase through a legal context such as heavily regulated brothels. i believe that a brothel should be the only legal avenue for a person who wishes to buy sex should be able to do so. i believe those brothels should be the place that people who wish to make a career out of selling their body safelyand the place where people can legally purchase sex. on escort services, that i am unsure about because escort services are usually a bit less exploitative than prostitution. perhaps a licencing and regulation system would suffice.",conservatives

so yes, the liberals do play a part, but they won’t be throwing in something crazy like “every canadian will receive $100k each for getting passed the pandemic”.

and, to be fair, life is actually pretty good. the real reason to get huffy and fight about something like bill c-10 is that it's fun to be huffy and mad sometimes - none of us really know what we're talking about (we're mostly just repeating talking points) and none of us are actually likely to change anything.",conservatives

it would make more sense to address the opposition’s (legitimate) concerns with a charter review once clause-by-clause consideration has been completed, but the conservatives are doing it this way for purely political reasons. there are dozens more amendments proposed on the bill after this, so the charter review would be of a half-amended bill.",conservatives

&gt;in a minority parliament, the opposition controls committees, which means they can change bill c-10 without the support of even a single government mp. but the conservatives are not using that power. they’re not even trying. instead they’re talking out the clock, much to the delight of the litany of overnight broadcasting experts on social media clamouring feverishly for bill c-10’s death.

the opposition *party* doesn't control commities. this has to be intentionally obfuscating. 


&gt;this suggests something else is going on, that the outcry over bill c-10 is being sustained by people whose ultimate goal is to kill the entire idea of canadian cultural policy in the internet age. 

yes, that's the only possible explanation. surely it couldn't be a concern of the chilling effects that might follow.


&gt;the doomsayers’ american-style free speech fundamentalism is way offside with most canadians: 83 per cent of canadians support (58 per cent) or somewhat support (25 per cent) legislation to hold companies like facebook and twitter, and their individual executives, legally liable for broadcasting illegal user-generated content. this is not a betrayal of free expression rights. canadians simply understand that free expression and the rule of law have long coexisted in our country, and that applying our laws fairly and equally to internet giants will not compromise our right to say whatever we want within the law.

so you support making individual executives personally liable for the dissemination of expression on a vast platform and don't realize that the only rational response to that is for those platforms to clamp down on everything regardless of whether it's within the law? 

&gt;conservative mps crusading to protect mark zuckerberg from canadian law should pay extra close attention, because conservative voters are among the most likely to believe that facebook weakens canadian democracy

a cheap shot with no basis in fact. conservatives aren't concerned about protecting zuckerberg, they're concerned about the effect of zuckerberg protecting himself. if the author can't grasp that the concern is a chilling effect then he has no business being published. shame on the star for giving him a platform.

i understand economics, land use, construction, and manciple regulations just fine. i also understand math. 

if you were to make this property a “4-plex townhomes” for families. the property is 4,000 sq.ft, you have setback from the road and surrounding property lines. cities also mandate 1 parking spot per unit now, so thats 320 sqft x 4 = 1,280, but we are gonna cheat and make them small and hang the asses of the cars into the public space so we will just do 250 x 4 = 1,000. 

setbacks plus loss to parking spots ~1,500 sqft. and that is being very frugal, you’d loose more. 

so we have 2500 sqft to work with. we will make them 3 floors, basement, main, upper. 2500/4 = 625 sqft footprint per unit x 3 floors = 1,875 sq ft per unit. make it a 3 bedroom plus “den” with 3 bathrooms. 

initial house cost - 1.75 million

demo cost - .25 million (need permits,  hazmat because old houses have lead paint and asbestos, hard to get truck and digging equipment in)

new utilities - .25 million - need to pay the city to rip up the road and run new sewer, new water, new bigger natural gas line, the old house had only one 100 amp electric service we need 4 new 200 amp service. 

construction cost - 1.5 million would be cheap for all, we need permitting, water sprinklers installed, energy efficient windows, roof etc. 

so our cost is 3.75 million, base cost. plus we financed the property that took 2-3 years to build so we have financing costs. 

and then the developer is gonna be the saint and only want .25 mill profit per unit. so that’s 1 mil more bringing the total to 4.75 million.  divided by 4 =

just looking at some crazy stuff that certainly sounds great - but i'd really like to know how exactly they're going to go about doing it - perhaps just snap their fingers like magic. one example in their covid-19 action [platform](https://www.ontariondp.ca/covid-19-action) is cutting auto insurance in half across the province - not sure what the plan for that would be.

another is \"yes\", we strengthened our ties to the current leadership which is not a fan of trump. 

my perspective on it is: (1) it's not to our benefit to put down trump. the pm could have said \"we are so happy to have a partner who is aligned with our ideology and we look forward to working together...blah blah blah\". there is no need to rag on trump as it shows us to be mildly \"back stabby\". there is even no need to mention trump (2) interfering in the internal politics of another nation is a no-no. if i was biden i would say \"our past president was a fine president who represented our nation well, and even though we may disagree on some policy issues, i want to make it clear that he is a fine example\". this gets trump's base onto your side and stops dividing the us. i'm rambling.

this is funding for a real universal childcare system. the budget itself makes the case persuasively:

&gt;the very best example of the economic power of an affordable, well-run early learning and child care system is quebec. at the time the *québec educational childcare act* was instituted in 1997, women’s labour force participation rate in quebec was four percentage points lower than the rest of canada. today it is four points higher. and quebec women with children under three have some of the highest employment rates in the world. furthermore, studies show that child care alone has raised quebec’s gdp by 1.7 per cent. 		  
&gt;  
&gt;furthermore, td economics has pointed to a range of studies that have shown that for every dollar spent on early childhood education, the broader economy receives between $1.50 and $2.80 in return.  
&gt;  
&gt;beyond the simple economic facts, it is also a question about the kind of canada we want. early learning and child care represents a chance for the country to offer each and every child the best start in life. it represents an equalizer, a way to build communities, a bold feminist policy, and the most effective step we can take to support our economy in the short, medium and long term. it is about making sure that everyone has the same access to opportunities, even from their youngest age.  

the phase-in period for the funding is fairly reasonable and not backloaded to any significant degree. so i'm very pleased with this program, it's going to make a huge difference for families.",liberals

del duca's problem will be to prove his trustworthiness. he's a career politician with a couple of skeletons in his closet, and is connected to wynne. the tory attack machine will do a number on him, i'm sure, and i'm not too sure how well he can rebut those attacks.

the olp also has serious organizational problems. in the most recent numbers, the liberals were *fourth* in fundraising--behind the greens! of their eight mpps, one is the retiring kathleen wynne, and the most prominent member michael coteau is jumping ship to the federals. the federal liberals are so dominant in ontario right now, and there is so much political talent within trudeau's ontario caucus, that the provincial party is forced to settle for the b-list.

there's also the problem of strategic voting. in normal circumstances, with an unpopular tory leader, a lot of ndpers would strategically vote for the liberals. but the ndp is the official opposition in ontario, and horwath is much more of a household name than del duca. unless the liberals can really solidify their current lead in the polls, there could be a vote split in the centre-left and ford squeezes by with 35-36% of the vote and retains a majority.

a big question is, what will ontarians want in 2022? if they're looking for competent and moderate management, i think the liberal brand has enough resonance on that front to consolidate the change vote. but if ontarians are looking for a progressive government that will really move ontario to the left, del duca isn't a good messenger, and the ndp will have an easier time. and of course there's the chance that ford will regain just enough popularity after the pandemic to keep the reds and oranges out, leaving many ontarians (and most redditors) utterly bewildered.",liberals
