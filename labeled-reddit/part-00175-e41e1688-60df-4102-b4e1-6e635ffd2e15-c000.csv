hhjrxf3,2021-10-21T08:35:17.000-07:00,"ndp will vote against the liberals ‘if they do something that hurts canadians,’ jagmeet singh says probably a pretty reasonable analysis (with the usual caveates for 'anything can happen in a canadian election) but the one wildcard mentioned is \"why'.  the reason the gov't falls can be critical. it certainly played some role in this last election. 

from the ndp's point of view - jag has to realize that things don't get a lot better for him after the next election. either he picks up seats or he either gets fired or likely does worse in the election that follows and then gets fired. 

so he should be planning for a moment when the libs are weak during a scandal (and god knows there will be one, it's every 4 - 6 or so months with them) and looking for a subject he can beat them over the head with so that he can stand up in righteous indignation and say \"we wanted no election but this we can tolerate no further as a party of conscience!\". then either they go to an election on their own terms, or the libs back down on whatever they're making a fuss about and they actually have something to show the voters. 

a possible example would be pharmacare on the next budget - if there is no plan or not a very good one they could dig their heels in and stand a good chance of  either winning the point or gaining seats in an election called over that issue.",liberals

there'd be no value in that at all. the libs wouldn't even be interested, they'd just use the fact he opened negotiatons to steal a few of their people like charlie angus if they could in unwinnable ridings and either toss the rest or run the party into the ground. the libs don't share. 

and there is a great deal of difference between the libs and the dips. if you're not a student of politics i could see where a cursory glance would lead you to think they're the same, but they're far from the same. 

but the jagster needs to make those differences stand out more clearly and define his party, and make it look like he really will push for the differences that matter to people. and in between elections he's just a little puppy dog.",liberals

hq7o3eu,2021-12-27T08:08:30.000-08:00,"liberal idealistic policies are unsustainable as the world faces resource shortages by 2030 i will just ignore your bad faith comments, and insults and get to the point.

&gt;doesn't support your position at all. it mentions 'community' - and obviously refers to the social structure. 

yes the community is obviously a social structure. he is saying conservatism values the community. will go deeper into the on the third point.

&gt;the \"way of life\". as \"blackadder\" says, toffs at the top, pleebs at the bottom and me in the middle making a fat pile of cash from both\" :)

i dont know what the heck you are trying to communicate here.

&gt;so - he mentions social structure and religions kinship. where's the family? where's the benefit of the community you mentioned? where's nature?

again, he is talking about community on that quote. if you want a longer deeper quotes here you go:

***\"social membership goes hand in hand with individual attachment. human beings begin life in a state of attachment to the mother and to the household that shields and nurtures her. as they grow to adulthood the bond of attachment loosens and widens. the young adult needs the mother and the family less, but friends and cooperation more. in the course of a lifetime customs, places, networks, institutions, shared ways of being all amplify our attachments, and create the sense that we are at home in the world, among familiar and trustworthy things. that sense of the familiar and the trustworthy is precious to us, and its loss is an occasion of anxiety and mourning. the most important input into conservative thinking is the desire to sustain the networks of familiarity and trust on which a community depends for its longevity. \"  - conservatism 2017***

***\"that said, however, we should recognise the countervailing tendency in conservative thought. as well as emphasising the need for custom and community, conservative philosophy has advocated the freedom of the individual, conceiving community not as an organic network bound by habit and submission, but as a free association of rational beings, all of whom have, and cherish, an identity of their own.\" - conservatism 2017***

&gt;so - he mentions social structure and religions kinship. where's the family? where's the benefit of the community you mentioned? where's nature?

***\"we human beings live naturally in communities, bound together by mutual trust. we have a need for a shared home, a place of safety where our claim to occupancy is undisputed and where we can call on others to assist us in times of threat. we need peace with our neighbours and the procedures for securing it. and we need the love and protection afforded by family life.\" - conservatism 2017***

***\"the conservatives, by contrast, have on the whole been moved by a vision of settled communities, united as ‘one nation under god’, attached to the land and the family, and building their cities as centres of civilisation.\" - conservatism 2017***

***\"if we look at the history of the environmental movement in britain we see those conservative principles working successfully, not through the state, but through the civil initiatives that challenge the state, beginning with the protests on behalf of the forests in the 17th century, initiated by john evelyn's silva, and leading to the creation of the national trust at the end of the 19th century. vital to this conservative environmental movement has been the love of beauty. through art, literature and local activism the british people have given voice to the idea of beauty as a shared resource, an irreplaceable fund of 'social capital'. beauty, they have recognised, acts as a barrier to the top-down brutalities of the exploiters and the social engineers.\" - conservatism and the environment***

there you go, next time instead of trying to look like an idiot. at least read a book or something. 

&gt;no, as we have just seen you completely misunderstood that. modern conservatism is an evolution of classical 

that is exactly what i meant by saying **\"so the modern conservatism you speak of is mainly a outshoot of liberalism\"**

aka it grew out of liberalism.

&gt; it just suggests that the gov't should remove itself from the social element and rely on free market forces to resolve many of the issues that others might want the gov't to be in control of.

how is that different from classical and neo liberalism. you have failed to answer my question on how your version of \"conservatism\" defers from classical liberalism if you arent socon.

&gt;that doesn't make them conservative in the slightest. like - at all. 

as i have already proven community, religion, familily, health and tradition are all conservative values.

&gt;are you seriously trying to claim that communist russia was a conservative society? nope.

yes i would say \"nope\" because **they rejected** ***tradition*** **\"monarchy, and tradition surrounding it\" and** ***religion*****.**

like how uneducated are you, while you claim others are uneducated. its very ironic.

&gt;so dont' give you the thing that you think is true. gotcha.  


stop trying to look like a idiot. litterally you cut off half of my comment there while not differentiating between \"many times.\" and \"all times.\"

im being charitable to you, by admitting there are specific times that you are correct. but here you are acting dumb, so you can feel like you won a debate or whatever.

dont reply to me, if you are going to act like this, after i have tried to talk to you in good faith. 

&gt;so you have failed to make any argument for your original statement. i tell you what, lets make it easier - just give examples, one for each. we've got john a - obviously a traditional conservative. which of his actions represents each of the things you mentioned?

as we saw, i didny fail to make an argument. its just that you fail to have any knowledge of what conservatism is in reality.",conservatives

again, though, we can argue over the number of billions and how to qualify those billions, but in the end, government still gives/provides billions to the o&amp;g sector.

all these numbers we have been talking about also don't include subsidies for green tech and renewable energy which are given to o&amp;g companies. subsidies for carbon capture is one example.

i think green subsidies/incentives/loans/ect are more palatable and justifiable in 2021.

i get o&amp;g is an important sector. many of my friends and family whom are still in alberta depend on the sector for their job. what gets me though, is that while we are providing and have been providing generous support to the o&amp;g sector for decades, somehow, taxpayers are still left to pick up more of the bill for things like abandoned oil wells and other environmental damage caused by the industry. 

plus, support for o&amp;g hasn't really been translating into as many jobs as it did in the 2000s and before. the o&amp;g sector in alberta can extract just as much oil now as they did in 2008 or 2014 with a fraction of the people. many parts of the sector have become increasing automized. afaik, it's more the oil sands than smaller fracking and drlling operations that have become more automized, but still.",liberals

the shift in views about which party is best on climate change is pretty intersting

among the 46% of canadians who say climate change will be a top 3 issue driver for their vote (3rd highest of all issues we tested)...

when asked which party is best on climate change....

when asked which party is best on climate change....(among those who rank it as a top 3 issue)

liberals - 34%
greens - 22%
ndp - 14%
cpc - 7%
unsure - 17%

back at the start of the 2019 campaign, 39% picked climate change as a top issue... and when asked which party is best...

greens - 44%
liberal - 22%
cpc - 7%
ndp - 7%
unsure - 20%

takeaways:
1. far more people think climate change is a top issue today (39% to 46%)
2. the liberals own the issue in a way they didn't in 2015.
3. the ndp has also gained - from 7% to 14% today
4. green's aren't automatically seen as the best
5. few think cpc best on issue",liberals

&gt;enfin, sauf le candidat du ndp qui avait refusé le débat parce qu’il ne parlait pas français.

donc un candidat poteau très probablement. ça aurait sans doute été moins insultant de ne pas nominer de candidat dans ce cas. 

&gt;tout parti progressiste au québec va inévitablement devenir souverainiste.

je ne partage pas cet avis. à partir du moment où l' axe déterminante lors des élections était fédéralisme vs souveraineté au lieu de gauche vs droite, c'est difficile de tirer des conclusions par rapport aux tendances. 

pour chaque politicien ou dirigeant souverainiste issu de le gauche (lévesque, kadhir), il y en a de la droite (bouchard, dumont). pour chaque politicien ou dirigeant fédéraliste issu de la gauche (lesage), il y en a de la droite (charest). le pq et plq ont pris des tournures social démocrate et néolibérale à différent moments de leur existence. 

2018 a marqué le changement de l'axe déterminant, ou plutôt, a rajouté la gauche vs droite aux considérations électorales. on sait qu'un peu plus du tiers des électeurs caquistes sont souverainistes et que la moitié des électeurs de qs est fédéraliste. tout ça confirme qu'il y aurait de l'espace dans la scène politique québécoise pour un parti souverainiste de droite et un parti fédéraliste de gauche. 

mais puisque le système électoral ne rend pas la vie possible aux nouveaux partis ou ceux sans siège encore, je pense qu'on aurait plus de chance à voir la caq virer souverainiste et le plq faire un virage de gauche que de voir d'autres partis faire leur entrée à l'assemblée nationale (à l'exception peut-être du pcq si ils se maintiennent dans la région de québec). 

&gt;ne pas se préparer à la cohabitation avec les souverainistes en s’imaginant que ça va se régler tout seul est de la grande naïveté.

comme je l'ai dit plus tôt, je pense que les partis fédéralistes devraient montrer une ouverture aux souverainistes. mais cela doit dépendre de la version du souverainiste exprimé. il y a une grande différence entre \"je préfère un québec indépendant, mais je pourrais accepter un canada dans telle ou telle circonstance ou avec un nouveau arrangement constitutionnel, auquel je milite pour au sein de ma nouvelle formation politique\" et \"faut se débarrasser à tout prix du canada, je ne changerai jamais d'avis là-dessus, mais en attendant, laissez moi devenir candidat, député, ministre, etc tout en sachant que je militerai pour la destruction de notre gouvernement à la prochaine occasion / référendum\". je ne pense pas nécessairement que ce dernier voudrait être candidat pour un parti fédéraliste, mais ce genre de chose mérite d'être éclaircit lors d'une investiture. 

&gt;et ça c’est pendant qu’il faisait semblant d’être « happy tom » au lieu de son identité réelle d’élémental de rage à forme humaine.

mulcair a vraiment raté sa campagne en 2015. message stratégique anti-harper sans mettre de l'emphase sur les propositions, propositions faites aux mauvaises démographies, piètre travail de terrain, erreurs clés lors des débats (l'emphase sur le déficit et la position sur le niqab), et persona d'happy tom à la place du angry tom comme tu le mentionnes. 

à propos, je me demande toujours où en on serait si la position du niqab aurait été différente ou au moins, plus nuancée. le npd a eu du mal a décider comment se positionner là dessus. dans un monde alternatif où mulcair se positionne avec plus d'élégance, devient pm...malgré ses opinions personnelles, j'ai l'impression que les médias et politiciens anglophones seraient plus en mesure de débattre des questions controversées à la place de faire des hyperboles anti-laïcité et pro exceptions religieuses. comme avant.",liberals

and i didn’t mention the 2019 loses because it’s a complicated story and i didn’t want relitigate a tried talking point by those that never have or never would support the party.

but in short (or long, i guess), the of the quebec caucus was something that was well predicted by any one that paid any attention to the political landscape of 2015 through 2019.

by election 2015, the ndp was already in dire straits in quebec. the party retained 16 seats, but 10 were only won with around 1%, and the rest below 3%. if the 2015 election took place a week later, or there was a bad storm on election day, the ndp would have been whipped out completely. 

following the election the ndp was in deep debt and the bloc had become resurgent in quebec. they ate into the little vote share the party had left. and without money, they were helpless. mulcair, being mulcair, chose to do little fundraising to cover debts and absolutely no organizing in quebec or anywhere for that matter. the ndp was in complete chaos well before jagmeet singh even entered the leadership race.

he took over a party in panic and he had some growing pains in his first year as he got comfortable in the role of leader. the party was still and organization mess and facing bankruptcy by the time he came into power. they had to mortgage their hq. being leader when the mess that was festering under mulcair blew up, he took the blame. he had only been leader for a couple months at the time. 

a million headlines of “the ndp in chaos” are exactly helpful to caucus solidarity or fundraising efforts, plus you had a ndp mp fairly publicly saying that quebec would never and should never support a openly religious leader. that mp eventually left the party, but the damage by him and all the headlines to the same effect had done their damage.

all that led to some members openly planning a coup, if you remember if he didn’t win in burnaby south. a riding, by the way, that is by no means a safe seat for even the most popular ndp mp as kennedy stewart would tell you himself having won it with very narrow margins.

he won the by-election and was able to refocus on rebuilding the party over a year after he initially became leader. things started to improve on the financial end, but polling was a different matter. the bloc had just elected a new and fairly popular leader the month before and had settled their own problems and the liberals were still strong in quebec despite the snc lavalin affair. the bloc mostly took back support they lost to the ndp and partially the liberals. but even prior to early to it, the liberals were very strong in wuebec. even without snc and a resurgent bloc, the liberals would have taken nearly all of the ndps quebec seats they barely won in 2015.

the party was polling as low as 8% in some polls by writ drop, was projected to lose official party status. once the campaign began, fundraising began to improve and polling began to climb up. a stellar debate performance all but save the party outside of quebec, which if you’re paying attention, was a lost cause for years now. the ndp finished the campaign on election day with 16% vote share and 24 seats. 

momentum stay strong after the election too. the ndp paid off all its debts a year after almost being bankrupt. in 2021 they’ve had excellent fundraising and are now flush with cash and polling is stronger than their historical average at just about 20%.

the reason for losing half the caucus are more complicated, and it’s not all jagmeet singh’s fault like some liberal partisan want to make it seem to sow discontent.",liberals

kim campbell is one such example.  she's not a very good example by any stretch of the imagination, but she is an example.  and while she's always been a democrat, sir hillary clinton is another.  when she was first lady of the excited states, it should be noted that most american democrats at that time were much further right-wing than most canadian conservatives in most respects.  but enough with the pointless examples, let's boil this down to brass tacks.  we all know why most women support justin.

first and foremost, he's the best looking prime minister canada has ever had by a mile.  second, and if you've ever even met a woman you know how important this is, he tells women what they want to hear.  

when a woman asks you for your honest opinion, she doesn't really want your honest opinion.  she wants to hear her honest opinion, only she wants to hear it in a deeper voice.  if you don't know the value of telling a woman what she wants to hear, you've obviously never been in a relationship with one.",conservatives

speaking as a western canadian, honestly it sounds like a lot of short-term pain and a lot of long-term benefit.

quebec is an province whose uncooperativeness with the rest of the country is rivaled only by alberta, and while western canada does have legitimate alienation grievances quebec somehow manages to simultaneously behave as though they're the fulcrum which canadian life revolves around, as well as the weakest and most oppressed province. cutting quebec out of canada would do wonders for a sense of national canadian unity, because try as we might quebec is entirely disinterested in such an experience. federal expenditures reliably exceed federal revenue in quebec too, so its not like we'd be losing money in federal budgets.

with quebec out of the picture, western provinces suddenly become dramatically more relevant. hoc would get cut down to 260 seats, and all of a sudden federal elections stop getting called before the polls are closed in bc.

1. demands that come from the left are unreasonable purity tests to be served only with empty promises that are immediately reneged upon. those votes aren't worth chasing.
2. demands that come from the right need to be addressed with concessions in the interest of gaining votes.
3. we're better than the alternative.
4. the increasing disillusionment of the left with this political strategy as it has played out over decades represents a moral failing of the people who hold these political priorities.

this is a fundamental rejection of reality. voter engagement literally comes from the belief that there is in fact a chance that voting has a chance to institute the changes you care about.

the right understands this and aggressively works to signal to their voter base that they are willing to bring their interests to the table, defend and pursue them over time. the signals that the left have received has consistently been \"you need to moderate your political priorities,\" while they watch the existing infrastructure they value be eroded and sold off to private interests by the party who claims to be the only moral choice.

when the electorate responds to parties' failure to follow through on their progressive promises, you need to recognize that trying to blame them for whatever \"monster\" is cooked up by the bc liberals or cpc is nothing more than a convenient self deception meant to allow the party to absolve itself of having to take ownership of its own failures.",liberals

could you at least agree that there has to be some limits to the religious or cultural freedom of anyone living in canada, notwithstanding the charter ?

for example, can we agree that we don't want people murdering someone for *honor*, or mutilating young women because it's a cultural practice somewhere else in the world ?

why can we agree on these limits ? that's because we believe they go against canadian values and we believe it's fair to somewhat limit someone individual freedom for the society's greater good.

the same principle is applied by the law 21, just in a different way. secularism is *very very* important in quebec. more than anyone not living here can probably imagine. people want the state and their representants to display the same *absence* of religion. they are free to do whatever they want at home or anywhere else, but not while representing the state in a position of authority. i personnally don't think it should apply to teacher because it seems to me the \"position of authority\" argument is too weak for teachers and other professions but i understand where the law comes from.

you are free to disagree, but you must understand where this law comes from if you want to understand is true meaning (which is not \"québec is racist\").

gooo0o7,2021-02-24T16:15:51.000-08:00,"ndp calls out liberals for voting to kill mp’s pharmacare bill irrelevant.

the canada health act outlines a _voluntary_ program under which the federal government will agree to give a province money to fund the health system if it meets certain requirements.

there's nothing in the canada health act stopping a province (well, let's just be realistic) alberta from, say, shutting down their public health system entirely or replacing it with a private one. but if they do, they lose the healthcare funding from the federal government, access to reciprocal agreements with other provinces required under the act, etc.

this is similar to what the us federal government does quite often. they also have limited powers to dictate what the states can do, but what they _do_ control are the federal purse strings. they've threatened to cut highway funding to states in order to lower speed limits and raise the drinking age nationally. they've threatened to withhold education funding to states that don't comply with their standardized testing.

they tend more towards using the stick while we use the carrot, but it's the same principle. the federal government gets to decide how to spend federal government money and can attach whatever conditions they want to it. there's no reason a pharmacare act cannot be implemented the same way as the cha.

in the previous 2016 election which caused the yukon party to lose (previously named the progressive conservative party) it was the public outcry after they opened up the [peel watershed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peel_watershed) to resource development. it was a huge controversy, the premier lost his seat in the election.

[cbc - after 15 years, final yukon agreement signed to protect the peel watershed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/government-first-nations-agreement-peel-plan-1.5255446) - 2019

&gt;disagreement between the yukon government, conservationists and first nations over how much of the watershed should be protected from industrial development went all the way to the supreme court of canada.

&gt;the territorial government was found to have ignored its treaty obligations when, in 2012, it ignored the peel planning commission's recommendations to protect about 80 per cent of the region from development, and instead presented its own plan that would have seen roughly 30 per cent of the region protected.

generalizing, things of focus tend to be mining, conservation, and working with/negotiating with the various first nations groups. add in climate change and covid and i think you cover 99%.
