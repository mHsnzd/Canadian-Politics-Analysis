no, it's not, as anyone who understands the history of the party would know. this is an issue of a big-tent party with clear divisions between the reform and pc constituent parts. this is an issue of a party membership that skews reform and reachable voters that skew pc.

&gt;i don’t see why it’s so bad for conservatives to have a moderate, progressive even (for the tories anyway) agenda for once

that wouldn't be bad at all - i think most posters here would support that. the issue is they're not really trying to - they don't commit to progressive policies because they don't want to alienate the reform/socon base. so you get the flip-flopping. 

&gt;y’all criticize them for being outdated and then criticize them when they try to modernize.

we're criticising them for talking out of both sides of their mouths, trying to have their cake and eat it too.  

&gt;we should just have one party then…oh wait, i think they call that socialism these days.

not sure what that random socialism comment was about, but having one party is the crux of the problem. the cpc isn't one party, it's two (or more) crudely stitched together. breaking it into pieces would be a huge improvement.",conservatives

it's the same thing for the last paragraph too, the same can be said about political belief. voting for the conservatives and having a cpc pin as a police officer does not mean you adhere to everything they say. you can't know their true beliefs are unless you ask them. we still have rules to make sure they are neutral and appear so though. in québec, we decided that people shouldn't show any bias whatsoever in those jobs, why should an appearance of religious bias be acceptable?

quick aside, politicians are elected. if they say things we disagree with like the things you keep mentioning, we can vote them out. judges and police officers and such are not voted in. that's why certain rules and laws exist to make sure they are as neutral as can be.

 trudeau might retire from politics before the next election.  it's very rare in canadian politics for a leader to win four elections in a row and he's won three already.  leaving early gives the chance for the party to properly change leadership before the election season. but i don't see this happening before the end of next year.  and if something significant happens like the cpc splitting or a second pandemic or his poll numbers shoot up somehow i could see him going around again.",liberals
hi5x9lv,2021-10-26T07:01:15.000-07:00,"innovative research poll: tofino trip more damaging to trudeau than we or blackface well, now that you're asking who i think is responsible for the wrong info being on the itinerary (the location line said ottawa, on, and not tofino, bc), i have two answers, one simple, and one complex:

simple - ultimately trudeau is responsible, whether staff made an error (because he is responsible for pmo staff as the one who put them there) or whether he directed them to lie

complex - clearly if staff made an error, while trudeau is ultimately responsible, he's also not really culpable of anything, because he wouldn't have directed them to lie. so, if what you're really getting at is, do i believe it was an error or intentionally misleading, i have to say that none of us have enough information to know, so we can only speculate. people who are looking for a scandal obviously will speculate that it was intentional. i'm not sitting around hoping for a scandal, so i simply considered what i thought was most likely. 

i find it much more likely that it was a simple error because 1) i don't think trudeau or anyone else honestly believed he could just fly across the country and go for a walk on a public beach without someone noticing, and 2) even if he somehow believed that he could walk around in public, as prime minister, without anyone noticing, he also would have known that the consequence (political fallout) of being caught was so high that it wouldn't be worth the risk, even if he believed the probability of getting caught to be small.

so, because i don't think 1) or 2) are remotely plausible, the most likely thing was that the misinformation on the itinerary got published because no one reviewing the itinerary paid attention to the location line. i bet they're paying closer attention now, though!

but, to be clear, as the head of the pmo, trudeau is responsible when they fuck up. but that's different from him being guilty of lying, and anyone who is convinced that it was intentional should ask themself if they have anything factual to base that belief on, or whether they're concluding that based on speculation only. and if they're speculating, i sincerely believe that their evaluation of the available information is questionable.",liberals

***\"traditional conservatism is 100% about 'conserving family, community, health, nature, and traditions.'\"***

i don't have to move any goal post here. traditional conservatism is 100% about conserving family.

yeah that was a typo lol. should say supporting\\* the family

&gt;so traditional conservatives would screw over single moms? like if the husband dies, it's not a 'family' anymore? hmmm.

then if you say \"so you wouldn't call a motorcycle that lost its wheel a 'motorcycle' anymore? hmmm.\"

like the obvious answer is, this is a broken motorcycle.

just like a family that is ripped apart, is a broken family. this isn't hard dude.

i have issues with pr too, because in a parliamentary system seats don't equal power. if you get 15% of the seats you don't get 15% of the power. you get either some power or none based on the coalition that forms, and in a country like ours where at present most of the voters are center to left of center conservative parties would probably be left out of government leading to increasing alienation.",conservatives

it's complicated but it's possible that the issue lies more in logistics than intent. 

it would have been preferable to do that, i agree, but he did instead make calls with various different indigenous groups instead which was perhaps more logistically feasible? maybe they were arranged after the election? i don't know the specifics, but there is a reasonable explanation out there regardless of politics. 

the vacationing bit to me isn't really a big part of this to me cuz after an election before next cabinet is probably the only time he can give his kids some family time and flying to tofino early and working remotely to make the calls was maybe a choice of balance vs political gain.",liberals

sorry, i didn't read it carefully. i thought you were implying the opposition could ask to form government before a election.

&gt;the gg then tries to see who is likely to command the confidence of the house and asks them to try to form a government. almost always, although not necessarily, this will be the leader of the largest opposition party.

in other parliamentary democracies the opposition has approached a figure like the gg to ask to form government instead. we haven't done that but it may be a option if the other parties can agree to a coalition. 

i misread some intention into your comment and i was wrong. this is not my area of expertise and all i know on it is from some seminars by constitutional scholars on it when the prorogation crisis happened. there was some folks going around saying the gg could turn down the pm and turn to the opposition to form gov and i don't believe that is a possibility in canada.",liberals

i will push back slightly because the part of my objection (the reason i find the dismissiveness towards slippery slope arguments not compelling) isn’t that there is another comparable situation “right now” (which wasn’t one of your original conditions), but that i can easily imagine one.

the aids crises fits your conditions very closely. when it first emerged in the 70s it was highly volatile, and remains so in countries with less developed healthcare infrastructure. gay men and intravenous drug users were often blamed, not only by religious conservatives but much of the mainstream media, for ‘risky’ behaviours like unprotected sex or sharing needles. 

my guess is that it’s obvious to most that if someone is suffering from complications due to hiv/aids, that whether or not they use condoms (for example) should have no bearing on their access to healthcare, even in situations of limited healthcare resources. i imagine that many will find the comparison offensive on its face. 

but it’s the attitude that there should be any connection between personal decisions and healthcare access that worries me. i see the same attitude towards drug users (hell there have even been articles that argue treating overdoses with narcan creates perverse incentives).

a large portion of gun crime in canada is from domestically-sourced gun, and crime from domestically sourced guns is increasing. this is something widely proven by stats can. on top of that, in almost every mass shooting, the guns were domestically sourced or the guns registered to the perpetrators of the crimes. 

now, the reason why i said you should define the term “illegal” is because a lot of guns are “stolen” from the owner. these guns are not stolen by strangers, but by family members and friends (also verifiable by statistics). now, if the owner was storing them lawfully, there should be little way a person could both steal the guns and use them. so is it illegal or was the first crime in the process the person not following the laws their gun licenses require them to follow?

why would you think urban voters are ignorant, when on average, they are more educated and more exposed to diverse opinions and culture?  maybe it's rural gun enthusiasts who are in an echo bubble?  the core premise, which is false, is that, if you could just argue with the majority about gun details, you could convince them that they really do want these weapons in their communities.  they don't.  there's more to life than boomsticks, and shooting animals you aren't eating is not a sport.  i've said it a thousand times:  i wish conservatives loved cannabis culture as much as they love us gun culture.  we'd be way further ahead.",conservatives

and what if the legal cases don't go as planned, what if the quebec legal system doesn't kill bill 21? what then? do you support the federal government coming in and forcing the decision then? or will you just say \"well that's the law\" (which i'm sure is the conclusion many people appealing for \"non-intervention\" are hoping for right now, even though they won't admit it). i'm sure you're aware that the quebec government is entirely willing to use the notwithstanding clause to frustrate attempts to fight this in courts.

i think people ought to feel pretty strongly over the idea that a majority can strip charter rights from a minority. that's pretty fucked up. it's unfortunate that you don't seem to see it the same way, because if you did you wouldn't be trying to spin this as an internal issue, or trying to act like quebec has some special context that makes this okay (it doesn't, and if you really want to argue bill 21 is a natural extension of laïcité then i'll know you are arguing in bad faith).

but to reiterate:

&gt;but please, do continue to lecture everyone else on how quebec abrogating charter rights is totally something that should be dealt with internally. it's been going swimmingly so far, after all.",liberals

doesn’t really feel like a problem ottawa can solve. there are groups in quebec who oppose bill 21; maybe in time they can win hearts and minds on the ground and turn the democratic tide against what that law does.

h3obqcz,2021-06-30T22:28:49.000-07:00,"burning churches is 'unacceptable' way to respond to unmarked indigenous graves: trudeau what is the cultural value of the statue of ryerson? most people didn't know that statue existed. no one walked by it in reverence. it's an empty husk of metal the university put up in order to created a false sense of identity and prestige for their school. it's pretty pathetic.

statues that commemorate events are historical. statues that commemorate sacrifice, such as war-dead are ... questionable, but certainly of more cultural value by reminding us off the perils of war. but a statue is worthless when it commemorates someone who did terrible things.",liberals

his desired platforms?

\\- constitutional reform to limit pmo power

\\- add privatization options to healthcare

\\- limit immigration

\\- restrict timeline in which abortion is legal.

\\- stop giving money to indigenous and find other unspecified solutions.

all of these are completely losing platform positions for a national party.
