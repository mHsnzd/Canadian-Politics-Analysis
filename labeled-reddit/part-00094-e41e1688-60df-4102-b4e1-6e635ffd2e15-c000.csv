but possesses exactly the same amount of power over this particular issue (i.e. none, aside from the ability to say words that their audience might agree with). which is the point. maybe a better comparison would be if the mayor of a major city commented on this issue. again: same amount of power.

the parole board is federally appointed, federally regulated, federally paid, and the laws which they apply are exclusively federal as well. they have no reason to care one wit what any premier of any province has to say, because nothing that premier might ever choose to do will affect their ability to do (or keep) their jobs. they might care if the prime minister commented, because the pm appointed them, which is precisely why we haven't heard anything from trudeau on this.

that said, federal ministers can get involved. remember the correctional services decision a few years back that moved one of tory stafford's killers from a max security prison to a healing lodge? the minister of public safety didn't comment at the time, but later made a decision to order correctional services canada to review that choice, which resulted in csc reversing their decision. but until the decision was made, the gov't didn't comment (and fair enough).

i'd generally prefer it if provincial and federal politicians stayed in their respective lanes and avoided commenting on each others' business. but i don't think it particularly matters when they do.",liberals

that's missing the point. a lot of those countries while doing more than canada are still failing to meet their paris climate targets. most of the eu is set to miss its 2030 paris targets, including germany. the uk is one of the best performers in the eurozone and currently they're only about halfway to meeting their 2030 targets. almost everyone else is significantly below the halfway point

&gt;they definitely don't push for less. the climate denialism of our conservative movement is almost unique to the us, canada and australia.

i didn't deny that and that was not what was being debated in my post.

&gt;both the conservatives and ndp proposed tying transit funds to zoning changes and this strategy could go a lot farther than that. moreover, the federal government has gigantic fiscal levers that affect housing.

withholding transfers to mandate zoning/land use reform is a questionable policy in terms of how useful it would be. if you look at provincial expenditures as a percentage of gdp and compare program spending before and after the mid 90s when the cht and cst mandated a certain amount of spending on specified programs (with the threat of transfer removal if provincial governments did not follow suit), there was little to no change in provincial expenditures pre and post reform. the effect of the current mandates and their impact on provincial government policy for the past two decades, seems marginal at best.

we've gotten various politicians proposing using federal transfers to provinces/territories as a tool to coerce them into enacting certain policies for the past 4-5 years, but it's largely hypothetical as to how committed the federal government would be to enacting that policy and how effective and sustainable it would be. particularly if we look at the richest five provinces (on, qb, ab, sk, bc) and exmaine their non-equalization transfers, they only amount to between 9% (in the case of quebec) to 18% (for alberta) of their revenue streams, which those governments could easily cover the cost of themselves with minimal effort (quebec would just need to eliminate it's qst exemptions, while alberta, b.c and sask would need exemptionless pst rates similar to ontario and quebec). so the effect on using non-equalization transfers to withhold funding to 90% of the country wouldn't really hinder their ability to fund their own programs.

the other issue is that even if you get provincial governments to concede, the federal governments trying to enact zoning reform by proxy by convincing the provincial governments to convince to municipalities to make changes. it's a lot easier said then done. the municipalities (particularly the super nimby ones like vancouver and torotno) may not concede and resist federal/provincial infringements on their jurisdiction. it's a lot of hoops to jump through to address the problem rather than just addressing the problem at it's source (especially if the debate ends up becoming more about jurisdiction that zoning).

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the issue isn't that the parties can't agree, it's that they don't want to do the things you are proposing at all.

that's not really that different of a statement than the quote of mine that you referred to here. my only point is that the party's are largely not addressing the issue for political reasons, which you seem to agree with here.",conservatives

the upfront costs of preventive medicine will pay off in the long but are extremely hard to quantify and requires buy-in from the reader that a + b = c and prevents issue d. 

i would love it if our provinces spent more on upgraded diagnostic equipment. reduced stay time in hospitals is a double edge sword as issues can arise after they have left that would normally be caught in a hospital such as internal bleeding and infections and is even more difficult with an elderly patient. 

home care is not a horrible idea but one of the issues the work gets pushed to low laid psw's, it puts them in dangerous situations such as more road and travel time increasing risks of vehicular accidents, abuse from patients and family members. it's much harder on the psw's body as there is no equipment to help with lifting and moving the patients and longer work days.

i'm not sure where you are but ontario's telehealth is an absolute joke. they always say to go to an urgent care clinic or go to the er. i would love to see video or online doctors appointment become more common. 

a lot of the issues come from a lack of general practitioners across canada. we need to do more to make family practice a more appealing prospect. 

we both want the same thing. quality and affordable healthcare. unfortunately for a lot of people and politicians labour costs are the easiest thing to reduce as everything else requires an upfront investment with long-term payoffs. ontario already has one of the most efficient health care systems in canada due to conservative cutbacks and lack of substantial investments by the liberals. there is no gravy left in this train.

jason kenney, born in oakville, raised in wilcox, saskatchewan, came to alberta to be the premier and continue the policies of stephen harper. largely because notley winning in alberta scared them of a potential political paradigm shift. 

jason kenney, university dropout and anti abortion activist goes on to work for the right wing taxpayers federation. ever since he's been a politician. he decides he's going to gamble using the taxpayers of alberta's money. gamble on war rooms, gamble on fights with doctors, gamble on dumping 1.5 billion of our dollars into a pipeline that had a 50% chance of happening.

what is the return on that money now?

is there a reason the green line needs 3 month cancellation terms and that the ucp alberta government just doesn't have money for it, after countless studies, reports, evaluations, with the biggest players in the game for construction and a well thought out plan to get more benefits to smaller local construction companies by splitting up segments, and that is too risky but we have money to gamble using jason kenneys divining rig... not invest, __gamble__  using taxpayers money that donald trump would be president again...... for a pipeline. 

how many schools and teachers could have been bought with 1.5 billion?

how many parks that are being offloaded to municipalities, indigenous people, and non profit groups could have been maintained with 1.5 billion?

how many new industries could have popped up for diversification if the government pumped 1.5 billion into start ups?

how many albertan workers could have been retrained and educated with 1.5 billion dollars?

how much further could the green line and other extensions in edmonton be built with 1.5 billion dollars?

hospitals, doctors and nurses, how happy and resilient could our healthcare be with an extra 1.5 billion dollars?

how much could those small businesses who are suffering because of his lockdown policies and being closed could have used 1.5 billion dollars to keep them afloat during the pandemic?

what does this say about the ucp and jason kenney that he announces on march the 31st that he was confident enough that donald trump would win the election to bet our money on this? or that this was a wise investment for albertans who he has constantly been telling we don't have enough money for this service or that service, we're broke. what does that say about  jason kenney and the ucp, that they were banking more on trump winning and sending out that message than being responsible with taxpayers money?


he announces this at the start of a pandemic. when alberta already had people infected with covid, and canada had already had it's first death and he was comparing it to the flu. 

albertan's need to wake up and realize we're being used for ideological gains for the conservative party of canada to own the libs. create our own rcmp, our own cpp, then waste money on consultations and fair deal panels.  they don't give a shit about albertans, our well being, our land, or our money and hard work put in through taxes and it's increasingly evident they never did.",conservatives

gyzxnvt,2021-05-21T09:02:27.000-07:00,"‘no evidence’: researcher behind ‘anti-alberta’ inquiry backs off assertion the more profitable the oil sands are, the more foreigners buy them up. during peak oil prices as much as 2/3 corporations operating in the field were non-canadian, largely american ones. it makes perfect sense as canadian corporations don't have anywhere the resources to leverage capital to extract the most profit when the going gets good. everyone in the field knows that. when prices dropped, several foreign corporations - including the koch brothers - scaled back their investments. presently, out of the \"big 5\", imperial oil is majority owned by exxon - which owns three major refineries in western canada - and husky is majority chinese-owned. 

the conspiracies make no sense to begin with because it's squarely in the interests of foreign corporations (particularly american ones) for albertan oil to be as profitable as possible, because it's an easy source of money when the going is good and it ensure a safe source of oil feeds their american operations. which is plainly demonstrated in investment patterns and ownership of oil operations as described beforehand. and the form the conspiracies took (with exxon often being accused of being the \"puppetmasters\") are particularly nonsensical, because exxon literally has dozens of billions invested in extracting and refining albertan oil through their imperial oil stake. 

that's to say nothing of american corporations lavishly funding pro-oil media both in the us and canada, as well as having large-scale regulatory capture both in alberta and in the states. indeed, within canada you had pro-oil outlets like postmedia, the proud network and the rebel simultaneously push conspiracies about us oil controlling canadian environmentalists, while harshly criticizing the abndp and federal liberals whenever a foreign corporation disinvested from the oil sands. 

the point of the conspiracies was never to offer any sort of pushback or criticism of us interests in albertan oil sands, because outside of their narrow scope their proponents jingoistically support any investment by foreign oil corporations and attack their detractors. their purpose was to disingenuously discredit the intent of environmentalists protesting against oil sands emissions, offer an excuse to \"investigate\" them as a form of political suppression and also serve as a grifting project for ucp boosters. despite pouring millions into the \"inquiry\", you see the end result of the report being inexplicably delayed over and over and unable to produce any answers worthy of an evidence-based investigation. nevermind the $30 million/year being paid to the \"energy center\" so their staffers can plagiarize and shitpost on twitter. 

under the oh-so-canadian ucp, alberta gave hundreds of millions to the chinese-owned husky, which followed by telling shareholders [the $200m+ they were getting in breaks was going to be invested outside of alberta.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-budget-toews-notley-iveson-1.5338802) [earlier this year, a russian oligarch dipped his feet into the oil sands](https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/billionaire-russian-oligarch-igor-makarov-takes-major-stake-in-calgary-natural-gas-producer-spartan-delta).

h5sdr5w,2021-07-19T05:28:44.000-07:00,"mary simon’s lack of french prompts investigation after 400 complaints: watchdog | globalnews.ca the reality in canada is that you can occupy most positions of power without knowing one word of french because most positions have no tradition of bilingualism entrenched in them. some of it is fine - i don't think it's necessary for a calgary mp to know french - but when we're talking higher up federal jobs that are either responsible for delivering equitable english and french services for the population or being a high governing representative (gg, pm) whose country has adopted english and french as official languages, it becomes a necessity. 

we need english and french duality to be upheld and any time it isn't, it's a step backwards for linguistic equality. there's major trust issues in francophone communities towards institutions because we often cannot access what was promised to us. it also doesn't help that there's anti-french reactionaries out there who never accepted the premise of official bilingualism and who are seizing on any occasion to pull a \"let's ditch bilingualism and be english only\" card out of their bag. for francophones outside québec especially it's a constant danger. 


&gt;what if she believed she was doing fine without learning it, and then as soon as she is nominated as gg bam most of the country expects her to learn french.

i want to be clear here that i mostly put the blame on trudeau and our federal institutions here, less so on individuals like simon. our country has had official bilingualism for over 50 years yet in all of that time it hasn't managed to be firm with bilingual requirements or impress upon people that they should learn french. or even leading the way in pressuring provinces to offer robust second language learning. these are institutional failures.",liberals

 trudeau's comments on the issue make it clear that he believes there are mitigating factors in simon's history that supersede her lack of french, notably:    
    
1) she is from quebec but was not given the same opportunity to learn french that other quebecers were.   
2) she is bilingual, and her mother tongue is a native language in quebec.         
     
now i'm open to the idea that these factors are not sufficiently mitigating; however, i do not see any convincing way to argue that it is unreasonable to believe that they are:          
if the lack of opportunity to learn french as a child was an injustice, and she qualifies to be gg in every other metric, then it would be reasonable--albeit not necessarily correct--to see not selecting her solely due to of her current limited french ability as being a perpetuation of that injustice.

**the report does not indicate that the government would spend less money if pharmacare were implemented**, it shows that *canadians overall* would spend less on medication, similarly to how in the united states *americans overall* would spend less if the adopted universal healthcare, however the government's budget would have to increase substantially, as currently these costs are borne by employers and individuals and do not come out of the treasury.

thus this would require tax increases or debt. and yes, millions of people will end up paying less with these increased taxes, however, this benefit will largely flow to lower income earners, who currently spend a substantial portion of their income on medication. the way our tax system works, it will only result in middle and upper income canadians subsidizing medication costs for lower income canadians.

anyone in the lower 40% of income earners do not pay anything into the system. they pay less in taxes than they receive in government benefits, and this is direct cash benefits, such as the canada child care benefit and provincial tax credits. when you measure their contribution against the government spending on health and education that they benefit from; an even larger proportion of canadians receive more than they put in to the system. what you are proposing is to have the highest income earners in the country, the upper middle and upper classes, to shoulder and even higher share of the tax burden in this country. that would have negative economic effects.",liberals

or rather, we're wondering if this was even an issue for that mp at all, considering [atwin and paul had never discussed it one-on-one.](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/annamie-paul-says-atwin-used-150621893.html)  and esp. considering [atwin dropped the issue immediately after becoming a lib.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jenica-atwin-green-israel-policy-change-1.6065520)  

but is trudeau trying to play both sides?  lol.  *of course!*  he's always been pragmatic on this front.  quietly supporting israel as is required.  but playing up palestinian rights enough to appease that section of voters.

trudeau's latest take?  'de-escalate, both sides.'

which, ironically enough, mirrors paul's.

oh but the parallel take on the issue was enough to make atwin cross the floor?  give me a break.  it was never an issue in the first place.

'green infighting' indeed.

&gt; this highlights how left-wing politics has become more about virtue signalling than policy

yup.  the theatre here def. makes it look that way.  why would any canadian really care about the green party's stance on israel/palestine?  they are strictly an environmental policy party.  that is it's entire grassroots movement.  that's it.  so this bs about their infighting on this front *has* to be manufactured.  it's preposterous.

atwin had just cynically moved on to the bigger party.

so as i said - when the people of alberta have made a decision then the gov't can listen to what they have to say and move forward to address their concerns. whining about being 'vague' about a thing that hasn't happened regarding language that hasn't been written is nonsense.

no he doesn't. there's no details to answer about. what part of the resolution that doesn't exist should he do something about? hmmm?

if trudeau came up with a cure for cancer in his spare time, the cpc messaging would come out about how trudeau was taking healthcare sector jobs from hardworking albertans, and probably used lab equipment sourced for communist china in the process - something, something, selling canada's healthcare to china.

regarding covid relief, most of their measures were totally inadequate until the ndp pushed them to be more appropriate. if you recall, originally cerb excluded anyone who made even a penny, then $1000, far from enough to live on. the ndp pushed them to the $2000 limit. same with the wage subsidy which was originally supposed to be only 10% with a whole lot of other limitations. this pattern repeated time and time again through the pandemic - liberals propose weak half-assed measure, ndp says beef it up or we won’t pass it, then liberals propose a more appropriate relief.

i suppose this is easy to miss when the issues don’t directly affect you, though they should - especially lack of action on climate. but there are many of us whose affected deeply, keep waiting for them to act, and they do nothing but make empty promises, or make things actively worse (like on housing).

sometimes issues like this make their way into the mix. i agree with you, if the issue is luxury housing &amp; segregation, they need to do everything they can from their side to help regulate what and how much developers can build, and how much they can sell it for (esp. in this market).

the answer is never to let developers off the chain to build wherever they want, and whatever they want. this is why i will always chuckle at whoever brigades this place with \"we should abolish all laws\". 

you *can* abolish all zoning - if you want issues like poor infrastructural support (gas, electric, roads, water), poor density allocation (e.g. overcrowding in some areas), poor/ugly/ not sustainable buildings being built, and so on.

the debate for mixed density has been raging on since the 60s. today, planners are looking for ways to design 15-minute cities. that relies on mixed use &amp; high quality transportation systems, careful consideration to green space &amp; mobility. the reason they move slowly is because they're trying to work around countless existing cases which show that if you zone fast you get huge problems and moronic long term results, long after all the profit has run dry. 

these things take years to put in effect, and the quality of existing infrastructure (as well as other nuances), guide how much you can zone where. so it's not like they're not doing anything or cancelling rezoning applications just because they woke up grumpy and feeling privileged that morning.

the dpa is a valuable tool that is used in many other countries so that employees of a company are not punished for decisions of the executives. it's done in such a way that a company can avoid prosecution but pay restitution. it doesn't prevent the individuals in the company from being liable or held responsible for their actions. people seem to assume the dpa was some magic wand being waved that only applies to snc lav, only in canada, and will never be used again. 

the relative lack of accountability for the executives who did the shitty thing is a seperate issue altogether.

both of these are tied to the fact that corporations are distinct legal entities and that maybe our laws associated need to be better at separating the people from the corp more effectively. i personally think that if some ceo and his top management friends fuck around that bob sitting at a desk doing work and john answering phones or cathy managing the finances of a satellite office for operating expenses should be punished for that. and i think the people at the top should be handed a serious blow for their white collar crime. because anything else generally let's the bosses go free with giant paycheques and savings, and the worker left on ei until they find something else to do.

also on the flipside there's a political nuance that seems to be lost often. the moj and ag are the same person and one is political the other isn't. that's a problem for sure. i think maybe those things should be considered for change. but no one wants to do it because of the fact that it's got down and up sides politically.

it also doesn't help that the pm is both a pm and an mp and he speaks in both positions when defending a company in his riding. and this gets back to the poor corp and people split. if a whole corp goes down the people at the bottom of the company hurt the most.

added to that - is the other other perception issue. people talk to eachother and they try to convince eachother of things. the mps and cabinet table can have a conversation with the moj about the political ideas and ramifications because that's their job. politics is politics. it's about polls and policy decisions etc. and this gets back to the moj / ag issue. not only that but the issue with the clerk was also dumb. he briefed her on the position of the pm and how the pm was thinking of the issue. it wasn't a threat at all.

to me this is a bit of a structural issue, and a bit of an issue on jwrs honest expectations of what politics and cabinet does. i think she went in thinking one thing, found another, had a hard time consolidating the inherent tensions, took a hard line on her positions, and then decided to air cabinets dirty laundry after she was shuffled. and given her recording of conversations with others, the way she talks in public, and the way she questioned the pm and cabinet's discussions and the way they operated as politicians, it was a schism that was never gonna be solved. 

i think what she's done is expose what would normally be something that likely every person in cabinet deals with layered on top of the structural issues noted before.",liberals

you should also consider that according to census, only 5.7% of quebecois identify in a religion other than some variant of christianity. thus you can see that the vast majority of persons impacted by loi 21 are christians. that is unless you say that minority religions are more likely to wear religious symbols? if so, is that not a prejudicial assertion, and thus racist in itself? 

finally, have you considered that perhaps quebec is an attractive place for muslims to immigrate due to its attitude toward religious symbols? or, perhaps, you think that islamic people are incapable of nuance? if so, is that not a prejudicial assertion?",liberals

\"questions around secularism
at the press conference, reporters pointed out that one of the eight days of the jewish holiday of hanukkah falls within the first self-isolation week, noting that special rules were not created around the major jewish holidays in september.
when asked why the four christmas days were chosen to relax covid-19 rules province-wide -- especially given that the caq government has strongly insisted, through controversial legislation, that secularism is key to quebec -- legault had a brief answer.
\"we think most people will be happy with those four days, so that's why we chose those four days,\" he said.
later, when asked if jewish quebecers could take the same approach, but earlier -- self-isolating for a week before seeing family at their own holiday in mid-december -- arruda said everyone must be in lockstep.
\"we say no, because we have to concentrate those meetings within the same four days,\" he said.\"[quebec privileges christmas over other holidays](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/legault-offers-moral-contract-for-christmas-suggests-quebecers-self-isolate-before-and-after-holidays-1.5195522)",liberals

&gt; “(safe supply) is certainly something we have invested in and will continue to stand for,” trudeau said during an announcement on mental health commitments.

&gt; “we’ve seen a number of provinces … particularly british columbia, very interested in moving forward on some forms of decriminalization and we are absolutely open to working with them.”

i'd suggest this is a brazen lie. 

bc's health officer has called for decriminalization as has the provincial government and the city of vancouver sent a letter to the minister of health asking for an exemption months and months and months ago. 

all signs point to absolutely nothing happening on this issue and that letter crumpled up in a bin somewhere. 

i'm sensing absolutely no sign that the federal government judges this to be a health crisis necessary of remarkable action. given the death rate (5 a day in bc due to toxic drugs) it is a crisis situation.

sadly i think this quote could be broadly applied to how this government has responded to other crises in this country such as the affordable housing crisis. there's an assertion by the government that it's a priority, but the reality is little action on the ground and no interest in deviating from the status quo approach and trying novel ideas.

i really don't think there's any interest from this liberal government in doing anything substantial on the toxic drug crisis and i expect the crisis to continue. 

decriminalization may not end up being the answer, but in a crisis situation you need to try new things, and this liberal government is clearly committed to the status quo.",liberals

the youth vote needs to turn the fuck up if they want housing prices to be an actual election issue. because if the people most likely to vote are directly hurt by housing prices going down, then no government is going to go hard on that issue.

&gt;
&gt;effected by the provinces.

the vaccine rollout was indisputably supply-limited until the summer. some provinces (particularly ontario) created confusing booking systems that were hard to navigate and didn't allocate appointments optimally, but ultimately the number of doses in arms was limited by the number the feds could procure.

&gt;&gt;delayed reopening by months and cause excess unnecessary deaths

&gt;really going to need a source on that.

just check out other countries' experiences (israel is the most obvious, most extreme example). high vaccination rates allow countries to open up more with fewer adverse health outcomes. if we could have had more vaccines sooner, life would have been better. 

however, the question we *should* be asking is whether trudeau could have been reasonably expected to procure more vaccines faster. i don't think there's much he could have done given canada's lack of production capacity or bargaining power.

h55z20u,2021-07-14T01:46:11.000-07:00,"more than half of canadians say liberals did a good job on covid-19 pandemic management for starters, the cews was administered to corporations that were profitable specifically if subdivisions or subsidiary companies were reporting losses during the pandemic. in several cases, this meant that a company like gdi (which is an office maintenance/cleaning subcontractor) were bringing in record-breaking revenues during covid, and still received over $30 million from the government. **linking the cews to overall company performance rather than underperformance by a small segment of the company** would have been straightforward enough and avoided hundreds of millions of dollars being transferred to corporate pockets.

secondly, **incentivize the retention of employees by making it a necessary requirement for receipt of cews**. the gdi case is interesting because despite making record breaking profits and despite receiving millions in government subsidies, they laid off employees anyways, many of whom had to turn to cerb or ei at the end of the day. with all that taken in to account, because the cews wasn't linked to any employee retention it was quite literally free money, which companies could accept and then use to line their pockets while cutting their workforce to get even richer.

the fact is that cews had very few incentive structures in place to guarantee that companies receiving the benefit would actually act in a way that retained employees and avoided people at risk of layoff from applying for cerb. it is pretty straightforward to tie benefits like this to actual recipient behaviour, in fact federal and provincial governments do it all the time with personal benefits to households and individuals.

it is also the case that even though the cews was literally a handout to the wealthiest entities in canada that cost the government hundreds of millions of dollars that the people that they chose to pursue for \"fraudulent claims\" of covid benefits are households who applied for cerb. apparently this government cares immensely about individuals making off with thousands of dollars of public funds, but doesn't care if millionaires and billionaires do the same thing as long as it's under the guise of business as usual.",liberals

hbz0mv0,2021-09-07T06:04:41.000-07:00,"home ownership is becoming a lost cause and the liberals did worse than diddly squat i couldn't agree more. zoning in canada and the us has been understood in a deeply flawed way which has made wealth and vehicle ownership paramount to urban life. this has lead to much of toronto's \"sprawl\" communities like durham, oshawa and mississauga to be unlivable concrete wastelands with more parking lots than parks. 

i am familiar with the video you posted. riverdale is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in toronto. 1.4 million dollar detached homes and $700000 one bedroom condos aren't a problem for the people who can afford them. they are a problem for the people who cannot afford them. most working people cannot afford to be locked into a 25 year contract on an illiquid asset like a house, that they can't afford in the first place.

a person working at mcdonalds will likely never own a home in riverdale even with a %50 price adjustment, simply because there is too much demand. current zoning laws just impoverish them further by forcing them further away from their work and forcing them to own and operate vehicles, or take lengthy and inefficient commutes with what limited public transport is available. 

there needs to be alternatives for people who can't/don't want to own property. for contract and low wage workers (a growing portion of the population), home ownership simply isnt possible or even desirable.",liberals

1) i do hate his culture war nonsense and hes become as addicted to wedge issues as harper and like harper i think hes run out of steam and just gotten nastier and more defensive with time
2) i do think hes basically insincere (the u turns on electoral reform, calling the election because parliament is apparently full of toxic obscructionism etc)
3) i dont like the policies either (the carbon tax is good but i dont like the social media laws, not a fan of his pre covid budgets, the canada's back shtick which petered out to not much of anything)

cpc had a convention immediately after forming.  reorm party, block. etc . all had 'em pretty quick.  i can't remember about the greens - but they never were a real party that was just the cult of lizzy as wev'e seen.

the influence on the housing sector is more idiosyncratic, and maybe that is part of the story for victoria/vancover.  however, the universal increase in home prices post-covid is more reasonably due to an interest-rate effect (plus a sudden preference shift) than an unobserved increase in foreign money.

my point is not that a majority is certain, it is that tools like this make us vastly underestimate uncertainty. and then we get surprised (by brexit, by both trump elections, and by our last two majority governments in canada, not to mention nova scotia).

grenier gives ranges of seats for different regions. but the scenario where the tories win 55 seats in ontario (the upper limit in his model, which i think is pessimistic) is also likely similar to the scenario where they win around the upper limit in other regions. errors can be correlated.",liberals

it was a national poll by ipsos. of course specific areas are going to differ. i'm sure some areas of canada are very into polygamy, but it doesn't mean it's nationally accepted. doesn't change the national sampling.

the choices are

1. do the federal worker and airline vaccine mandate
2. don't do it

there is no middle ground here. since 80%+ agree on it, it's going to be done. that kind of agreement on an issue is pretty rare in politics.

&gt;no matter what mandatory vaccines won't work, a large fraction of the country will litterally die before they allow themselves to be forced into this \"clear mandate\" trudeau has.

vaccine uptake is extremely high in this country. it is at 86.6% of the eligible population with at least one dose, as of now. of the remaining 13.4%, not all of those are going to be the ones who will \"literally die\" before getting it -- they might just be hesitant. so it's not a \"large fraction\" of the country.

people are still allowed to do all _essential_ activities without a vaccine, even in places that currently have vaccine passports. if you want to travel between provinces you can drive. there are lots of things that require additional checks before you have the privilege of doing them. you need a license to drive. you need vaccinations and a negative tb test before working in healthcare. you need a criminal record check before working with kids. you must be over a certain height to ride a rollercoaster. a vaccine for some optional activities is just one thing among many. don't get the vaccine, then don't do those things.",liberals

hdrmcp9,2021-09-21T07:13:24.000-07:00,"erin o'toole's fight to remain conservative leader has begun i think there are two basic schools of thought that'll dominate the divide in the cpc over the next little while.

group a (the \"get rid of o'toole\" faction): the cpc needs a real right-wing unique value proposition in order to win over conservative voters. by moving too far to the centre, o'toole alienated his base and stoked the ppc, and failed to win over liberal voters who would rather vote for the genuine article instead of a likeness. ergo, the party needs a new, charismatic leader who can deliver the long-promised return to power.

group b (the \"o'toole should stay on\" faction): o'toole was a rookie leader (barely 1 year leading the party so far), and he made rookie mistakes on the campaign trail. the people around him, although smart, are also new at this (with more experience running leadership races than national campaigns). like andrew scheer, he was one breakthrough in the 905 away from victory. unlike andrew scheer, such a breakthrough might have been possible. the next election is probably in 1-2 years, so rather than spending time on a divisive leadership race so another rookie leader can make the same rookie mistakes and lose yet again, o'toole and his team should conduct an exhaustive post-mortem and work with the new caucus and within the party to get ready for next time.

if o'toole had to face a leadership review tomorrow, i suspect group a would win. but he won't have to face one tomorrow, he'll have to face it at the party's next convention - currently slated for 2023 (which, the way things are going, might end up being after the *next* election). assuming the national council doesn't call one earlier, and he doesn't find himself faced with a full-scale caucus revolt or - like scheer did - a sizeable personal scandal, he has some time to lick his wounds, figure out what went wrong, and make amends internally.",conservatives

h0c0qkg,2021-06-02T02:57:50.000-07:00,"china 'exporting their authoritarianism overseas' through canadian institutions, hong kong advocate warns &gt;among the various methods are efforts to establish political influence in canada, for example by extending its belt and road initiative to include interconnectivity with strategic trade infrastructure overseas. the report cites the construction of the 470,000-square-foot “world commodity trade center” near the vancouver airport, which detractors say fits into beijing’s broader strategy of controlling trade links and expanding its strategic interests.  
&gt;  
&gt;such efforts, including promises to invest massive sums into canadian natural resources and other assets, has in turn dampened the willingness of canadian politicians to criticize chinese leadership, wong said. prime minister justin trudeau has faced criticism for what some observers call a soft stance on china, which is widely attributed to canada’s heavy dependence on the country for agricultural and other exports.  
&gt;  
&gt;another area of influence is the practice of “elite capture,” under which chinese authorities seek to “create engagement, influence policy decisions, and form mainstream discussions that are more favourable to chinese party-state interests,” according to the report.  
&gt;  
&gt;the chinese communist party spends roughly $10 billion per year on so-called “soft power” tactics, in which it seeks to sway public opinion through academic and other avenues. in the last 15 years, the party has installed roughly 500 confucius institutes on foreign university campuses, according to beijing-based consultancy development reimagined, which promote chinese culture through lessons in mandarin, history, and a range of other subjects.  
&gt;  
&gt;china has also expanded its influence through academia, particularly in the area of research and development, often through “ludicrous funding opportunities that trap academics and researchers into long-term coercive relationships” funded by foreign actors, the report said.  
&gt;  
&gt;canadian politicians on all levels have gradually become more aware of such efforts, the report said, but “inadequate federal regulations” in particular have allowed such partnerships to continue.",liberals

2) define alt right? being a conservationist of culture and to defend a non indoctrinating education is alt-right? i could say the same about you; calling you alt left for your stance on abortion in the education system. the only argument that you have stumped at, is the “catholic indoctrination”.

but once again, i expect a catholic view point. but catholics don’t push a mainstream anti abortion narrative, progressive conservatives do, which i am technically but that’s not what i’m talking about or supporting even. the topic of abortion should be kept out of all schools do to the fact that teachers don’t push a equal view point on the matter. they should though, but never realistically educate students without a political bias.

3) ah yes, the native argument. because as being apart of a catholic school i must acknowledge the discrimination and cultural termination of first nations peoples.

it’s funny you use that because they openly exploit the government handouts they receive because they have been oppressed in the past. not only that, they are extremely pro segregation and even proposing integration is deemed as “racist”. because having a nationality identity over class and cultural identities are “evil”!

4) reproduction rights and sexual rights ≠ abortion handouts and contraceptive promotion. it’s funny how you, as a “moderate” (leftist in disguise), support the idea the introduction to abortion in african countries some how improves those said countries.

you won’t acknowledge the fact that the african countries are either unstable through cultural and civil warfare, or the other reason that you’ll more likely acknowledge is the fact that they are disease ridden and extremely underdeveloped. reproductive rights does nothing to improve these countries asides from limit population growth. there is simply no evidence of that being the case.

don’t justify population control in foreign countries as a canadian either, because that’s pretty immoral by your standards. what happens is that when institutions like ippf are introduced to these countries, they allow foreign aid to pass through these countries. but you’ll never ever see institutions like the ippf solely fund a country because they are in trouble with out being able to establish themselves in the country.

there was about (-/+) 300 total firearm homicides in 2018. more than 40% of those came from handguns, and majority of these homicides were gang related. i think homicide by rifle was around 80 individual cases.
