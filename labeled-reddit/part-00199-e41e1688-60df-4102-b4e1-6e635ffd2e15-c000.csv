they often go over budget by insane amount. i’m talking double in some cases, and are just ridiculously expensive upfront even if cost overruns are kept low. the return isn’t measure in the short to medium term (5-10 years), they are measured in multiples of decades. once built and operational, yeah, there eroi is great, but that isn’t the only thing that matters. 

canada isn’t a nation that has tons coal or natural gas we can’t replace with solar, wind, or hydro. solar and wind, in particular, are much cheaper and much faster to build. they will change our energy mix much sooner than nuclear could ever. 

there really aren’t a ton of benefits for nuclear in canada. just 18% of our energy mix is coal or natural gas, 67% is renewable (60% hydro, 7% wind/solar), 15% nuclear. nuclear isn’t the answer to that 18%.

it’s a bad investment for us. we need 100% net zero emission energy production, like, now not maybe in a decade if we’re lucky. government investment is much better spent on solar and wind. hell, even certain types of biogas from resulting from green bin composting could be better investments to net-zero future (biogas can be tricky though, but i digress).

nuclear doesn’t have a particularly strong case for increasing its share of the energy mix. we should maintain and extend our existing plants as long as possible but, i’m not convinced even maintaining 15% makes much sense for canada that has so much of its base load addressed by hydro.

i don't think ideology is where chrétien deviates from trudeau - no doubt there are differences, but at his core chrétien was a pragmatist. he had some deeply held views on things like quebec's place in confederation, but in terms of day-to-day governing, he was more reactive than a visionary. i think this is where his difference with trudeau comes from, he seems to worry that the approach that trudeau and co are taking is not netting enough results, and that following the steps of the more ruthless old guard of the lpc would help to that end.

what we agree on though that chrétien is still wrong. i think it's just a different time now - there are very few \"old guard\" liberals left anymore, other than nobodies like john mckay and hedy fry who stuck around in their safe seats. certainly nobody left from the pre-justin era strikes me as the type of people who can have significant pull in the government, except dominic leblanc who's already an important minister. the few prominent chrétien/martin era grits that trudeau had in 2015 are gone now - goodale, dion, mccallum, and brison have all left or been defeated in goodale's case. the new, reinvented liberal party is very much built around justin trudeau, for better or worse, and i just don't think chrétien style politics can work for him, both in terms of ideology and governing approach.",liberals

comparing to the order of canada again: pearson, trudeau sr., clark and turner all received their cc within a year of leaving office, as part of the subsequent year’s list of appointments. you can probably chalk the 3-5 year timeline for mulroney, chrétien, martin and harper up to the fact that the order’s constitution places limits on the total number of living ccs and annual appointments to that rank, or to remaining in politics after leaving office (thinking of harper here, who remained an mp for some time after losing the election). regardless, submitting a nomination for a former pm, and their appointment to the order, is pretty pro forma - i doubt the advisory committee spends much time debating or considering that particular choice.",liberals

the right is imploding because they’re finally realizing they’ve been played by an ottawa politician in cowboy dress-up. kenney used this province while it was struggling to up his reputation for a federal leadership run and - surprise! - doesn’t actually give a shit about any of us. conservatives are very bitter about the whole thing. 

he doesn’t listen to the concerns of his caucus and makes unilateral decisions with zero public consultation. 16 (at least? maybe more) mlas from his own party, including the speaker, signed a letter of dissent last month. constituency associations are circulating another letter demanding kenney’s resignation which should be sent to him in the next few weeks. backbenchers are starting to break away because they know their reelection bids are in jeopardy with so much public hatred of kenney.

we have a progressive tax policy for income tax... for capital gains, it is a 50% inclusion rate.

no one is saying that we can't have some form of redistribution, which we already do to help with the rising inequality. it is about the lengths the ndp and far-left want to go - that is where the problem lies.

by examining the spectrum of existing ideas within the political culture of a nation. for instance many people refer to a left, a right, and a centre within the bolsheviks. that doesn't mean that they weren't left wing communists. when they banned all other parties they remained communists and communists in our political culture are firmly on the far left. same with the nazis banning all parties remaining fascist right wingers. 

you make the mistake of thinking that left right and centre are purely relative relations. this is perhaps what happens when people have no grounding in political philosophy and think instead purely about the balance of power and popularity within the political system, distinct from the culture and spectrum of ideas. 

if you banned all left wing parties in our system it wouldn't make the left most party from the surviving group left wing suddenly. 

i describe political ideas independent of their political system because that's the only way to make sense of it without falling into the trap of being pigeon holed by your own narrow experience of politics.

&gt; because when anything is free it essentially has no value

yeah, tell this to any poor person who can't afford housing and watch them laugh in your face.

&gt; it's just that you must presume to know what people want when you take taxes and create social programs.

most people should, and do want whats best for the collective good, otherwise what is the point of even living in a society?

&gt; i am not coerced into purchasing the product or service beyond what i need to survive

do.. do you not think we need things like healthcare, housing, and food in order to survive? what, under socialism would you be coerced into buying? education i guess? but even that is like, pretty important.

&gt; the system itself creates enough overall wealth that the poorest within the capitalist system are generally better off than the poorest within a socialist system.
&gt; 

lol yeah at the expense of the global south maybe, even then this is just simply not true in *many* cases. just look up some quality of life studies, even the capitalist countries with heavy social policies have far higher qol than us or the usa. if cuba wasn't being dealt heavy, disgusting, us sanctions simply for *being socialist* i think you'd be singing a different tune. 

&gt; taxing the rich while pretending to benefit the poor
&gt; 

yeah it probably wouldn't benefit the poor much under this neoliberal system we currently exist in but the left isn't exactly advocating for the continuation of this...

&gt; i would be in favour of a flat percentage tax to provide a basic universal income. this would replace almost all of the redistrubutive tax programs such as ui, welfare, and the many subsidies for housing, food, medical, etcetera

ok say this happens and we abolish social healthcare then we have a situation like the states where you are absolutely fucked if you get any medical bills. no, cutting social programs for ubi is the absolute most fucking moronic idea i've been hearing since andrew yang happened.

hgjy31k,2021-10-13T10:36:51.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] i'm reminded of omid djalili's stand up sketch about the crazy muslim guy with a hook. he was comically bemoaning the fact that the only point of reference that a lot of people in the west have of islam is when the media gets the \"local perspective\" and it's a crazy guy with a hook screaming \"death to america!\" he then goes on to contextualize it by saying, that that would be like if al jazeera went looking for the american perspective and found a guy who today (the bit is like 20 years old now) wouldn't be unlike a capitol hill rioter.

this thread is, like the crazy muslim guy with a hook, predicated on a very limited, extreme and perhaps completely uninformed understanding of its intended subject, in this case conservatism. most self identified canadian conservatives likely don't share too many views in common with your average capitol hill rioter.

not only is their situation not applicable to the situation in canada. it's probably a combination of limited, extreme and ill informed. how can you go about asking people to defend a perceived set of beliefs you call \"conservatism\" when it likely has nothing in common with what they would call \"conservatism.\"

lastly, as foolish, ignorant and dangerous as i think a lot of the views held by those sorts of people are (and i wouldn't call those views conservative in the canadian or the american context), i'm not going to scape goat those people and condemn them off handedly. these are people who have been let down by society in one way or another. they're to be pitied, not disdained even if their hopelessness had lead them down some repugnant avenues.",conservatives

there's no signs of the nb greens slipping. at all. in the 2020 election, the incumbents all increased their vote shares, and even got super close to taking two new ones in fredericton north &amp; moncton centre. they're still stabilizing at around 20% in the polls. coon even increased his \"favoured premier\" ratings in the most recent one. they've been incredibly effective even with just 3 mlas during the pandemic. 

and this while the federal greens were starting to slip nationally, even in atlantic canada, because of all the public infighting. the federal greens crashing in nb is bad for the overall green momentum, but it has no effet on the provincial greens' fortunes.

&gt;but especially pei we were about to see a green collapse anyway. 

i wouldn't say collapse in pei. they'd still form the official opposition if elections were held today. however, the pei pcs are polling so high (above 50%) that the greens would likely lose a bunch of seats. not because of anything that they've done, but because the pcs are blowing everyone else out of the water (much like the caq is doing in québec). 

&gt;and greens weren't a threat to the liberals in atl anyway

the greens were making headways into liberal areas. my riding of beauséjour went from resulting into dominic leblanc taking 69% and greens 4% in 2015 to leblanc falling to 46% and green laura reinsborough at 27% in 2019. the greens made impressing showings in key ridings in nb and pei, getting overall a record 17% and 21% respectively in these provinces. to say that they weren't a threat is blind. they might have taken a few more cycles for that to translate into more seats, but they were getting there.",liberals

the cbc and independent media love a horserace. literally every other major media outlet actively pushes for conservative governments. of course postmedia and the telecoms want o’toole to win, helping him win is **why** they’re in the money-pit media game. as a horse race means propping up the cpc, the incentives are for the media to push the cpc narrative as if they were it’s press secretary not question whether it’s completely bullshit.

politics is all “what have you done for me lately”. that’s what trudeau miscalculated he called this campaign both too early and too late. in the worst days of the pandemic it would have been a cake walk (like horgans and higgs). had he called it later and then the good news stories would have been on everyone’s mind. almost everyone had the  shittiest 18 months of their life and are looking for someone to blame.

in fact, government regulation could make online conversation more organic and freer. let me give a simple example, the government could require facebook to use chronological newsfeeds. your newsfeed would simply display what your friends have written in chronological order instead of the list facebook has curated (in part because facebook wants you to get in flame wars because it appears to increase engagement).

i think a lot of you are imagining some social media czar personally approving everything that gets posted on social media. i don't think that's realistic or desirable. what i would suggest is that we create regulatory agencies that place restrictions on the algorithms employed by social media companies, guided by some kind of legislation, and by serious research on how to improve digital civil society.

indeed, it could simply be a matter of requiring facebook to report on different metrics that they already track internally. regulators could provide and track legal definitions of certain metrics (e.g. misinformation) and require facebook to remain below critical thresholds, or else they will face some sanctions (just as say, financial firms in the us need to pass stress tests in order to be able to engage in certain riskier forms of investment).",liberals
