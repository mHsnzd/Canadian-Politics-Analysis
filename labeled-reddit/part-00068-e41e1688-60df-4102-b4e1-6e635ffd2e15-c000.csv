1. increase the stress test to tighten lending practices further in order to compensate for the *bank of canada's* historically low overnight rate. everyone knows low interest rates cause asset classes to inflate rapidly. there are ways to tackle a specific asset class without having to wait for the boc to act.

2. stamping out helocs being leveraged to accumulate multiple properties instead of being used for purposes of emergency repairs as originally intended.

3. raise a punitive home vacancy tax/speculation tax, not some single digit rate that barely chips into the yoy gains.

4. a foreign buyers tax that hits double digits.

5. crack down on numbered companies being used to launder money through our housing supply.

6. the provinces need to come up with a calculated solution to airbnb ghost hotels. the city of toronto has a reasonable solution if enforced with urgency. the pandemic saw a lot of them hit the market as long term rentals early on and rents started to drop significantly. while out of the scope of the federal government, a tacit acknowledgment or even a creative way to disincentivize short term rentals through a levy of sorts would go a long way.

7. crack down on the realtor cartels and give canadians access to the important data hidden behind the mls. it's unconscionable that a monopoly on such important data continues to exist in 2021.

there's more that can be done obviously but all of these would bring down prices significantly which is the only way to address the lack of affordability. you're not going to solve the problem if your methods only aim to slow growth.",liberals

this is a fascinating topic, but as i sit here i don't see it happening in my lifetime (certainly not to the extent that it is a \"border free\" union, or achieves the status of an additional state of the u.s.).

for example, i do not see canadians accepting the \"for profit\" health insurance model of the u.s. (i.e. health \"insurance\" vs. health \"care\"). i also doubt that canadians will accept broad american notions on (limited) access to abortion, or to american foreign policy generally. finally, the american approach to migration generally is also at odds with canadian sentiments regarding broader acceptance of asylees and refugees (frankly, the american immigration system overall is markedly at odds with the canadian approach). hard to see how we can achieve a close union with the u.s. when we would surely be the loser in all of those policy conflicts.

i could be wrong, and it might all happen some day, but in the meantime the present issue is the annual admission of large(ish) numbers of migrants to our shores, and how canadians feel about that policy going forward.",liberals

abortion will prob. come down to states / provinces.  it's such a ridiculous issue since all it does is encourage inconvenient border-hopping to get abortions.

i suppose another alternative would be to broaden a union with the global anglosphere.  canzuk, prior to a na union?  however that calls for some great travel distances.  ditto the commonwealth.

regardless, going full borderless is incredibly disruptive if implemented at the drop of a hat.  i think we'll likely see further global equalization *not* involving dropping borders first.  the insertion of india into a period of sustained gdp growth, for example will work wonders for them.

it's got more spending in it than i'd personally like but he's obviously trying to appeal to the center and blue liberals. 10 years is a very doable timeline, provided inflation and interest rates don't take off. and the spending he's talking about is very tied to economic performance so it won't force inflation the same way trudeau's spending (which is giving money for nothing) does.

people could always buy single detached houses at the suburban outskirts and exurbs. you can literally still get new detached houses there, so the entire premise about 'people can't buy what they want' has no basis. if detached house was literally *all* that matters, then those new houses would be priced just as high as comparable houses in the urban area - but that is not happening. people have to balance their home preference with community quality and commuting distance; not everyone is willing to sacrifice everything for owning a detached house. research can show that people want this and that, but the market is where the buck stops and decisions are made. 

we have already had a 'false market' for decades where low density in urban areas gets subsidized to hell with preferential tax policy and and transport policy. so while places to grow did not fix the underlying policies, it was an acknowledgement that the status quo was not sustainable and urban areas needed to evolve for the future generations. to be frank, it would have been very hard politically to fix the underlying policies for a more balanced and fair market. so considering that, places to grow was probably the least worst solution for a very hard to fix problem.

on the last point, high density hasn't stopped people from moving to other top tier cities around the world. prices and unit availability have been a barrier, but many are happy with the density because it provides other things they want, like jobs, easy commuting, and lifestyle attractions. it seems you are trying to project your personal preferences here to speak for the entire population.",liberals

the liberals got us through the pandemic in relatively good shape, but it cost us enormous sums of money. we're still bleeding cash and our public debt has exploded. eventually, the spending will need to be scaled back and mega deficit addressed.

the tories and ndp have some very pleasant stories about how this might be possible (cutting the mythic \"fat\" that has endured centuries of governments vowing to eliminate it or taxing someone who isn't you, dear voter). realistically, a mix of popular and unpopular tax hikes will need to be combined with unpopular spending cuts (at the very least, the end of wage subsidies and the scaled down crb) will be required before we can even think about setting aside cash to ease the housing crisis. 

once the liberals need to pivot from super-spenders focused on handing out cash as quickly as possible to getting the country's finances under control, the ndp will become markedly less cooperative with their agenda.

&gt;canada's rapid rebound out of the recession has a lot to do with how much better off we were going in. our housing market avoided many of the worst excesses that plagued the u.s., such as subprime mortgages. canada's banks were more stable due to both tighter rules on how much debt they could carry, as well as a more conservative approach to risk. [canadian encyclopedia](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/how-canada-has-recovered-so-quickly-from-the-recession)

curious what \"tricks\" harper employed. he was only in office a relatively short time &amp; he didn't have a crystal ball. also, it isn't his stated ideology to legislate strict regulations that would hamper the hand of the free market. if he was in power during the martin/chretien years we would have been in a worse situation i bet.

might have been worse recession globally since the great depression but it was not that bad for the average canadian. shit for the auto manufacturers but they got bail out money, which .... is that a conservative thing to do? hmmmm blasphemy to the free market god.

if modern day cons were actually conservative i might vote for them. harper campaigned on not going into deficit. jt campaigned on going into deficit &amp; result was one of the greatest majority's the libs had ever seen....our nation has ever seen. why if harper cons were such good leaders &amp; conservatives? it's pretty clear lpc did not win because canadians wanted to go in deficit. they thought if we're going to go into deficit i don't want to do it with the cpc that will leave us on our own and ditch us when we're vulnerable.

i'm actually pretty libertarian. served in the military, i like my guns, and i don't want anyone telling me how to have sex or who with or what i do in my private life overall, and i really don't give a flying f what other's do outside of public spaces. there would be a lot more things i'd let ppl do in public spaces, like not wear clothes. i'm not a nudist. i prefer to wear clothes. i just don't get why it's illegal. another discussion. you get my point. i'm pretty libertarian at a personal level.

pc's made a deal with the devil to avoid splitting the right so they got in bed with social conservative reform party numpties. they almost rendered the libs obsolete, but well...it cost them big in the end and unlikely they'll form gov now &amp; definitely not a majority. what happens when there is sacrifice of principles just to win.

cpc has not been libertarian. they seem like a proxy for christian theology trying to control all our behavior in our private lives. who to have sex with, what we can't believe, who we can't be tolerant of, etc.

i started copying a bunch of stuff but instead i'll leave part of the conclusion of a thorough analysis of harper's performance. i think it sounds very objective. gave him more credit than i would:

&gt;the harper government made four major choices that brought some benefits but inevitably entailed costs in the form of sacrificed opportunities:  
&gt;  
&gt;lower taxes in relation to gdp worked toward supporting long-term growth but also lowered levels of public services that could otherwise have been provided directly or indirectly (for example, via transfers to provinces).  
&gt;  
&gt;a lower gst rate (while keeping the level of gst credit) helped redistribute income toward lower-income groups but deprived the government of revenues that could have better financed public services directly and indirectly and provided more support to long-term growth through lower marginal income tax rates and increased spending on growth-enhancing physical and human infrastructure.  
&gt;  
&gt;trying to achieve a balanced budget strengthened the already strong federal fiscal position, but it did so at the cost of appreciably weaker economic growth at a time of significant slack in the economy in 2011-15.  
&gt;  
&gt;harper government policies, by favouring the development of the oil sands and neglecting environmental regulations, likely contributed indirectly to canada’s loss of overall cost competitiveness.  
&gt;  
&gt;in the end, a verdict on the degree of success of the harper government’s economic policies hinges on the relative values that one attributes to the various economic objectives. in our own judgment, after 2010 the harper government unduly sacrificed growth in order to improve a debt position that was already solid. [economic performance and policy during the harper years](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/october-2016/economic-performance-and-policy-during-the-harper-years/)

in fairness, o'toole's platform is better than i've seen of a federal con party in awhile. but it doesn't really differentiate itself from the libs approach substantially. so what moderate voter that voted lib in the last election is going to vote for him, especially in ontario?",conservatives

if we use families that would basically eliminate any reason to use taxable accounts to buy a home. a family aged 30 (i used 30 and 26 earlier because 30 gives you the max tfsa room and i wanted to use different examples, one which didn’t even use the theoretical maximum tfsa room) would have $151k in tfsa room and $70k in rrsp hbp. that’s enough for a $200k down payment without even thinking about market returns or interest.

i don’t think someone should put all their money in real estate, and never implied that. the rrsp hbp doesn’t take all of your money out of the rrsp (unless you have less than $35k in it). 

i’m not sure where i said someone who is looking to buy a town home is well off. basically all that i’ve said is that there’s no reason to worry about how the proposed capital gains tax will effect the ability of a first time home buyer to purchase a home. most canadians never pay capital gains tax anyways and there’s really no need to with rrsp’s and tfsa’s.",liberals

terror charges involve the suspension of  fundamental human rights and should be rare and used only when abslutely neccessary. they require more than one person and a certain amount of planning. therefore, it's irresponsible of trudeau and ford to call these terror attacks, as that implies they wish to see the accused right to a fair trial to be delayed, and to give police the authority to withhold information about this case as police seek to prevent more imminment attacks.  political leaders need to be much more responsible in their use of the word \"terror\" when describing politically motivated hate crimes, and citizens have to wary of the consequences of this. it could lead to authorities withholding info from the public for \"national security\"  reasons. you can call it racist, a hate crime, islamophobic, but characterizing as a terror attack could have unintended consequences.",liberals

the fact that the *federal* government is officially bilingual ensures that people across the country can receive communications from the federal government and federal agencies (like, say, canada post) in both official languages, but there is no constitutionally-protected right for canadians to receive services from *provincial* governments in either language.

nevertheless, certain provinces do extend linguistic services to linguistic minorities in their provinces as well. québec has a percentage-based formula to determine which municipalities can offer english-language services, for example. i believe there are bilingual municipalities in ontario as well, but that that is decided in an ad-hoc fashion and not according to a formula.

trudeau's declaration doesn't affect the status quo in any way. it doesn't change how the *federal* government operates linguistically (with a single possible caveat indicated elsewhere in this thread), and it doesn't change how the government of *québec* operates either.

edit: i may have made an incorrect claim above. it looks like ontario's status as officially monolingual is not actually enshrined by any law but is just enshrined in *de facto* practice. perhaps that's the case in other provinces as well. here's a resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_language_services_act",liberals

according to my prof, over 80 students in a masters program couldn’t figure it out, and he couldn’t really either. 

if the liberals wanted to make concrete promises and take the steps for real change, they would’ve done it by now. like you said, they’ve been promising this since trudeau senior. the problems with universal pharmacare are far from insurmountable (hell, we can double up on most of the funding mechanisms like the cht and regulations we use to fund the main healthcare networks), and there is the political will to do it. they just don’t prioritize it, because doing so would mean extensive negotiations with the provinces over specific coverage, managing existing insurance networks, apportionment of funds, and a lot of complicated, controversial stuff. and they just don’t have the desire to spend the resources on that.",liberals

even if it doesn't leave enough negotiating room, in your opinion, bills can be modified. even if this is only used as a starting point, effectively a statement from the federal government that this is how they envision pharmacare as working... and the provinces come back with a ton of things they want changed before they can agree to it... that puts us miles ahead of where we are today.

everyone opposed to this bill keeps saying that negotiations with the provinces need to happen. but the simple fact is (despite the cda being announced to oversee the development of a new formulary *three years ago*), those negotiations are not currently happening.

and it's hard to imagine them happening without the federal government laying out their vision for how it will work as a starting point... which is what this bill would have done.

i'm willing to entertain the possibility that a different approach might be better. i genuinely don't know. but if this government wants to use that justification for opposing this bill, while credibly claiming that they want pharmacare, they actually need to be pursuing those better approaches with some urgency. and they're not.

my wife is a type 1 diabetic. we have no drug benefits.

perhaps if i were some kind of policy analyst, whose life wasn't affected by this particularly closely, i'd be more concerned with the method and not the goal.

make sure that all gay blood donors are on prep. it's 99% effective against the transmission of hiv, you have to get tested for it every three months along with kidney functions and syphallis. and virtually every gay under 50 is on it or is in a committed, monogamous relationship. and its free in most provinces!

if i vote for the communist candidate in my riding then they'll get seven votes instead of six. oh wow, such progress, very democracy. stewart mccommie fundamentally cannot assist me with achieving my goals; voting for him is a waste of time.

if i'm in a riding where the conservatives might win then i'll vote for whoever is more likely to beat them. i agree with literally nothing that the conservatives offer. a brick would be a better mp than a conservative; at least a brick doesn't hate my brother for being gay. any alternative is superior to them.

as the story goes, kerr made his decision, and as soon as whitlam got wind that his government was about to be dismissed through the reserve power, he tried to call buckingham palace to have kerr dismissed as gg, but was too late.

in one way, it's a very good example of why the reserve powers are so important; very seldom to be used, but the one way in which a constitutional crisis, no matter how severe, can be quickly ended. but it's also a very good example of the risks inherent in giving an upper house democratic legitimacy and making it a democratic competitor to the lower house, without some significant re-engineering.

in the uk at the turn of the 20th century, the house of lords became increasingly proactive, ignoring the long-held convention that money bills should not be held for extended periods of time by the lords. this lead to the parliament act 1911, which eliminated the lords' ability to veto supply bills, and even gaining passage of that act essentially required asquith to threaten to ask george v to stack the house of lords with hundreds of new peers before the lords finally acquiesced. like it as not, even in canada, where the house of commons and the senate are nearly coeval (save for money bills, which must originate in the house), the long convention is that the senate not long stymy bills that have gained passage in the commons, but even with trudeau's modest reforms, we've seen probably the most activist senate since 1990 debacle over the enabling legislation for the gst, and in that case, much like asquith 80 years before, mulroney used his power to appoint extra senators to force through the legislation. even the framers of the briths north america act knew there would be times when the supremacy of the lower house might have to be backed up with a bit of constitutional muscle.",liberals

and, honestly, i may have believed federal green media in them being progressive, but it was only 2019 when \"don't be anti-abortion\" was added as a requirement, and that was in a very weak way, and only after significant pushback from the public. add to that the current situation regarding israel / palestine, i have absolutely zero confidence in the green party as a progressive body, regardless of what they might say on a policy page. if they want that to change, they need to remove such regressive viewpoints from the party much more readily, or establish that they would whip the vote to enforce these progressive policies.",conservatives

but he still chose to doggedly pursue a position in politics, without disclosing this charge to the party, and worse, the military. members of the military are required to disclose criminal charges. lying to the liberal party is one thing, but lying to the military while holding a commission? no matter how credible you find the allegation, that behaviour is bordering on treacherous.

thing is, if not raised during the campaign, surely this information would have come to light at some point. it was bound to come crashing down for mr. vuong. so it's staggering that he still chose to go ahead with it.

hdc8l79,2021-09-18T01:13:58.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] i agree with you. broadly speaking, i think people tend to fall somewhere on a spectrum of idealism on the one side, and realism or pragmatism on the other. the problem on the left, i believe, is that it tends to be more heavily populated with idealists—which can be good, because working towards ideals is what makes things better, and is at the heart of progressivism—but the nature of real-world politics is that those ideals are often going to be disappointed to one degree or another. the result is that the left is constantly fighting with each other over who has misunderstood or betrayed which ideals, a phenomenon perhaps most famously satirized in *monty python’s life of brian* with the feud between the people’s front of judea and the judean people’s front being more important to both groups than opposition to the romans. john cleese has said that part was specifically inspired by infighting amongst trade unionists in the britain of the time. meanwhile, with few, if any, true ideals on the political right, having been replaced instead with simple pursuit of in-group power—yes, conservatives, that’s what i think, go ahead and be mad about it—there is far less to be disappointed about other than not attaining that power. so, the political left is in a constant state of disappointment, which can lead to apathy and disengagement, while the political right steadfastly cheerleads “their guy”—and it usually is a guy—no matter what, while quietly smirking at the left’s self-doubt and relative disarray.

there may always be a tension between idealism and pragmatism that the left/progressives will need to deal with. in fact, i think it’s one of the defining characteristics of the movement. we care about more things, so it’s harder to do them all, and when they sometimes come in conflict with each other then there’s more work to be done to sort out the complexities, and more opportunities for somebody to be unhappy with the compromises. but when it comes time to take decisive action, like voting for a particular candidate, i think we need to put that aside and do what will create the best outcomes for us—i.e. be pragmatic—rather than focusing on our disappointed ideals.",conservatives

the first one - i think he wins that one. i think it's safe to say it wasn't a horrible campaign, but it had serious flaws that could be improved upon next time. he had a great intro but then had nothing in the tank for after, and nothing to really set him apart from the libs. 

the second one....  that's a problem for him. he has demonstrated that his word means very little to him. he will break it at a moments notice. his flipflop on the carbon issue was not great - but it was at least excusable for a few reasons.  however - his flip flop on the gun issue was simply undefenseable. he  looked weak, he looked like a liar, he looked untrustworthy, and that hurt him with more than gun owners. it was literally the moment he started to tank in the polls. 

so. how do you win back that trust? what do you say when the problem is people don't trust what you say?

if anything sinks him - that'll be it.

now, on the other hand, ranked-choice with *multi-member* districts, (a.k.a. stv or single transferable vote), with australia uses for their senate and ireland also uses, also for the same level of preference expression as irv, but *also* results in largely proportional elections (minor parties are still somewhat disadvantaged relative to pure pr, but not nearly to the extent of fptp or irv). stv was also one of the systems that was on the electoral reform committee's shortlist - you know, the one the liberals shat over because it dared to use math *gasp* in it's analysis.",liberals

what it would do is force the parties to be more moderate in their platforms in order to gain second choice support from the supporters of other parties.  it would cause our elections to be less confrontational.    i think that would be a good thing. 

what it would not do is ensure that the major parties had seats in all regions of canada.  this is why i would prefer a mixed system (where 1/2 the seats in a province were determined by fptp and the other half through proportional representation).  this would mean that all regions of canada would have representation within a government.  i think that would be good for national unity.

though - personally - an easy low hanging fruit for infrastructure is internet connectivity across the more underserved areas. part of why the telcos charge so much, and why they continue to say need high prices, is the fact that they need to cover monstrous spaces to get coverage to people. we need broadband and quality cell service in far more places, and i think if the government could invest there we'd see major improvements in a ton of places and in a ton of ways as the world continues to be more and more connected.

with more push to teleworking as options we could be less densely populated in some parts of the country. people could have cheaper internet and cell bills (telcos save money on bad roi infrastructure). and we'd have more reasons for better road and other infrastructure to more remote areas too.

i also agree on the small nuclear reactor route for sure - especially for provinces that don't have hydro or other more renewable resources that are cleaner than oil/gas/coal etc.

cerb was a decent floor fit for purpose - but yes, overall, we need better investments.

oh another good roi? housing. good jobs, good places for people to live for stability, tax revenues for local services and governments to maintain infrastructure we spend on etc.

also: yes i said feds have limited scope on housing above. they do. but they can offer money and they can hope the provinces take it. i just think we aren't yet at a place where province/federal is on the same page for this to really deal with it together - which is necessary. i feel like any money the feds offer will just sit there, cuz, no one wants to take it. they don't have direct options but i would like to see them ready to give when asked as soon as possible. we need serious transformational change for this, and it needs to come from every level but the brunt of responsibility is at the province and municipal level.

even worse, a lot of the details she claims are very mysterious are actually pretty clear.

&gt;first, what does \"continue\" mean? will the ndp keep the liberals' carbon pricing path, to $170 per tonne in 2030?

yes, that's what continue means.

&gt;it's fine to disagree on the policy action, but if so, what would the ndp implement in its place?

under the liberal system, companies exceeding 80, 90 or 95 per cent of the average emissions in their industry have to pay, but the ndp wants companies to pay tax on a larger portion of their emissions and [said it would set the limit at 70 per cent.](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/08/18/explainer/election-2021-main-federal-parties-plan-fight-climate-crisis)

finally,

&gt;relatedly, will this force federal policy on provinces? most provinces have their own provincial system; does the ndp intend to eliminate the flexibility in the current system which allows provinces to implement climate plans on their own, subject to a minimum standard?

i don't actually know the answer here. like most issues that must be negotiated with the provinces, it's probably kind of hard to say beforehand. but the defensive tone about the provincial systems is kind of weird to me..i certainly *hope* the federal government will override the provinces. having 10 different carbon pricing systems in one country is insane and inefficient. this is the worst aspect of the current carbon pricing system in my mind.

there seems to be some kind of weird beef going on between the climate economists like jaccard and winter and broader climate movement, including the ndp. i don't know or care what the roots of this are, but i really have to wonder if trashing more ambitious climate policy is actually helping the agenda.",liberals

hby1tho,2021-09-07T02:05:49.000-07:00,"ndp climate plan long on ambition, short on substance (again) the ndp platform has a number of promises to raise new revenues. they propose to raise the corporate tax rate by 3% (to 18%, the same rate it was in 2010). they propose to institute a wealth tax of 1% on wealth over $10 million. they propose to raise the top marginal income tax rate by 2% (to 35%). they propose to raise the capital gains inclusion rate to 75% (from 50%). they propose a one-time 15% tax on the excess profits of certain corporations during the pandemic.

because healthcare is a provincial jurisdiction, it's impossible for a federal party to have an exact plan as to what will happen since any changes will have to involve negotiations with the provinces. the gist of the ndp's plan though is adding pharma, eye, hearing, and dental care to the list of things covered under medicare and using some of the new revenues listed above to increase health transfers to not put undue burden on the provinces.

from what i understand from the ndp's climate plan, it's essentially the same as the liberals except they want to reduce the carbon tax exemptions for large polluters (which would raise new revenues) and maybe go a bit further on other things. 

neither the lpc or cpc have any plans to raise significant new revenues, while also promising massively increased. the lpc depends on \"closing the tax gap\" to reduce the deficit which is essentially \"we could've gone after tax cheats before, but we are doing it this time for realsies.\" the cpc platform depends on unrealistic economic growth to reduce the deficit (basically \"the budget will balance itself\"). so, realistically, the lpc and cpc will continue with massive deficits, raise taxes (contrary to their promises), or cut spending (contrary to their promises).

in any case, i would love to see full independent costings of each of the party's platforms. the pbo has so far only costed the wealth tax and pharmacare for the ndp, 11 various measures for the lpc (like an educator school supply tax credit), and none for the cpc.",liberals

&gt;we will provide national leadership and join with the provinces and territories to take action on climate change, put a price on carbon, and reduce carbon pollution.climate change is an immediate and significant threat to our communities and our economy. stephen harper has had nearly a decade to take action on climate change but has failed to do so. his lack of leadership has tarnished canada’s reputation abroad, making it harder for canadian businesses to compete.
the provinces and territories recognize the need to act now, and have already begun to price carbon and take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. we will end the cycle of federal parties – of all stripes – setting arbitrary targets without a real federal/provincial/territorial plan in place.
we will instead partner with provincial and territorial leaders to develop real climate change solutions, consistent with our international obligations to protect the planet, all while growing our economy. together, we will attend the paris climate conference, and within 90 days formally meet to establish a pan-canadian framework for combatting climate change.

what a bunch of vague bullshit! i trust there are numerous editorials from climate economists skewering the lack of detail in the climate plan from the third party (at the time).

the ndp's platform has a perfectly normal level of detail and the basic policy ideas seem fine. perhaps even a little uncreative frankly. i'm having a lot of trouble understanding why some climate experts are attacking it in the media. you'd think they'd welcome something to push the liberals harder but idk.",liberals

&gt;an amnesty order is in effect until april 30, 2022 to protect individuals who were in legal possession of one or more of these ***newly prohibited*** firearms or devices on ***the day the amendments to the classification regulations came into force (may 1, 2020)***, from criminal liability for unlawful possession.

people are most certainly in possession of prohibited devices right now as a result, the government has just said they won't arrest anyone for simple ***possession*** of one of the prohibited weapons (yet). it's legal limbo.

this is an important distinction because, from the rcmp page:

&gt;newly prohibited firearms and devices ***cannot be sold or imported***.  
&gt;  
&gt;newly prohibited firearms and devices ***may only be transported under limited circumstances***.  
&gt;  
&gt;newly prohibited firearms and devices ***cannot be legally used for hunting*** unless allowed through the amnesty.  
&gt;  
&gt;newly prohibited firearms ***cannot be used for sport shooting, either at a range or elsewhere***.

doing any of the above ***is still a crime*** (with significant penalties) and does not fall under the amnesty. if you were (somehow) not aware of the oic (as unlikely as that is), threw your m14 in the car and got pulled over on the way to the range, you'd be breaking section 19.1 of the firearms act, which could fall under a bunch of possible offenses (unauthorized possession in motor vehicle, for example), ranging from 2-10 years max jail time.

&gt;i carried a c7 for most of decade but have been aware for years that the whole family was going to get banned at some point, so i didn't even look at buying that way.

i mean, i think a lot of people saw that it was going to come eventually. but at the same time, this oic also caught 50 year old single-shot .460 weatherby big game rifles, which are what most people would consider the \"safest\" bet in terms of not being prohibited (the classic *they won't ban hunting rifles!*). i don't have any skin in this oic, but their planned magazine changes might brutalize a couple old lever guns of mine, which you'd also think would be legally \"safe\".

and wow, this was certainly off-topic for the op. on-topic, i'm honestly surprised that whoever threw the gravel didn't receive a very rapid introduction to a folding baton, although i imagine they didn't want to make a scene. at the same time, i'm glad we're still better than the us, where the president wouldn't be nearly as free to talk and meet with crowds. throwing gravel is still a shitty thing to do though, especially when we have a longstanding tradition of pieing politicians instead.",liberals

i really wish we would hold our politicians more accountable for this. toronto would be a 2nd tier city at best in the us, but out housing prices are on par with new york or london, and wages are on par with a small us city.

i wish trudeau could give a straight answer as to what the end game is here. either:

1. are we at the end of rapid asset inflation - are these prices the new normal?
2. is this inflation going to continue for the foreseeable future?

either way, there's a new permanent wealth gap that you can't cross if you're not inheriting money. you basically need to be in the top 2% of household income to buy a house in toronto now.

hakejzg,2021-08-27T01:21:55.000-07:00,"canadian blood services wants to eliminate wait time to give blood for men who have sex with men to quote a very good comment by /u/crystalynn_methleigh, they noted that every test has a rate of false positives, and a rate of false negatives. as a result, the amount of hiv we should actually expect in the blood supply is the rate of false negatives of the screening test, scaled by the true positive rate in the incoming samples.

we can reduce this in two ways: reduce the rate of false negatives of the test, or reduce the rate of true positives in the samples we test.

men who have sex with men in canada are hiv positive at a rate between 3% and 24% depending on region and survey. the estimated general population prevalence is ~0.17%. this means that msm in canada have between ~20x and ~200x the prevalence of hiv compared to the general population. more worryingly, as of 2008 it was estimated that up to 28% of hiv positive msm in canada were unaware of their infection. ([more recent data](https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/epidemiology/epidemiology-hiv-canada) suggests this rate is now ~13%, but that is still uncomfortably high.)

so allowing msm to donate blood will inevitably have one of two results: either we will end up with hiv positive blood in the blood supply, or we will face significantly increased testing costs as the rate of positive donations increases. this is a statistical inevitability of allowing donation from a group with 20-200x the hiv prevalence of the background population. [shortened]

it is a sad but evident fact that msm are afflicted by hiv at an absurdly high rate compared to the general population. it is not rational blood supply policy to allow donations from a group like that.

the blood supply system is not a human rights exercise for donors. protecting recipients of blood from blood-supply-mediated infections is and should be the only priority in crafting these policies. for these reasons, the blood ban is rational, and should remain in place. i imagine this is why trudeau has not moved on it, despite his virtue signaling promises on the subject.

i think these are very reasonable points they've made.",liberals

ha2imdm,2021-08-23T05:29:40.000-07:00,"globe editorial: the conservative climate plan isn’t half bad. but the liberal plan is better. climate policy is notoriously slow to implement and takes even longer to show its full effects, since most machines that produce ghg emissions last for decades - they don't get replaced every year. most cars on the road in 2015 were still running in 2019.  same with trucks, power plants, factories, furnaces... 

so the important thing is to watch our long-term emissions trajectory, since policies affect the technologies that companies/people use in *future* years (e.g. whether to switch to cleaner technologies), but don't have much immediate effect, as technology transitions take time to ramp up.

for example, we now see [every coal plant in alberta](https://globalnews.ca/news/7502144/alberta-coal-power-ahead-of-schedule/) scheduled to close down or convert to gas before 2023, and [two steel plants](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/dofasco-investment-1.6123829) in ontario recently announced plans to switch from coal to electric arc furnaces over the next \\~5 years.  those are big changes driven by government policies, but they don't show up in our 2019 emissions (the latest data we have available).

in terms of our future emissions trajectory... in 2015, harper's final year as pm, the government projected that canada's emissions would **increase 10%** by 2030.

since then, alberta and ontario scrapped many of their climate policies, but the federal government introduced a *lot* of new ones.

so as of the latest [2020 projections](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2021/eccc/en1-78-2020-eng.pdf), canada's emissions are projected to **decrease 31%** by 2030, under the current plan.

that's actually a pretty huge shift in 5 years.

&gt;liberals talk a better game but **i fail to see a major difference in actions between those two parties.**

that's hard to believe... there's been lots of major climate policies implemented under the liberals:

* nationwide carbon pricing, currently $40/tonne and rising to $170/tonne by 2030
* coal power phase-out by 2030
* funding for ev rebates and ev charging stations
* oil and gas regulations (methane regulations, clean fuel standard)
* tens of billions in public transit funding (if you look at a timeline of transit projects, canada's entering its biggest transit construction boom in history)

meanwhile, there were virtually no significant climate policies introduced under harper.  same thing with conservative premiers like kenney or ford (they actually rolled back many of the climate policies that liberal/ndp governments had brought in).

but in case i missed something, is there a recent conservative government in canada who brought in climate policies that you like?",liberals

however, it’s not fair to blame the ndp voters here either. in strategic voting, if it looks like the ndp candidate were going to win, everyone should pile on that candidate as well.

one of the best arguments *against* propping up the liberals in riding they are leading the ndp but trailing the cpc is that if the tables were turned, a large number of liberal voters might vote strategically against the ndp candidate because their real preference is the cpc.

however, in the end it’s up to the individual voter to decide what outcomes they would like/tolerate/dislike, and what impact on the potential results of those outcomes your vote would have.

take trudeau for instance, what i find most repugnant is his hypocrisy. he says he stands for one thing, but then the next moment his actions say another story. he seems like a man who expects to just be right all the time.  i would call him morally bankrupt. if a politician shows a lack of character, i don't feel i should vote for him. i feel like we would get a better standard in general for leaders if we expected more of them. or does the world just not work that way?",liberals

it is a great policy for attracting rural doctors, but not for retaining them.  we've used many strategies in ontario over the last 30yrs to get doctors to go to rural communities and set up and maintain a practice,  but unfortunately as the incentives dry up, they leave those communities.    in a loan system,  once the loan has been paid off, or the grant has been used up they can move to the higher income less demand areas.  

physician recruitment is a very challenging process, and keeping them in underfunded areas is just as challenging without provincial supports.    

many years ago we capped southern ontario doctors wages but they could continue to earn if they did shifts in northern ontario,  we saw doctors do a timeshare practice strategy in ontario getting family doctors to earn more, but as doctors got younger and wanted families this project really dried up as less were willing to do the northern placements.",liberals

every period of tyranny and human suffering was “progressive” for its era. but when we learned about these atrocities in school, we only learn about the man behind them. hitler, stalin, pol pot, etc. 


never did we learn about the african kings who sold their own people as slaves. never did we learn about the hundreds of thousands of germans who cheerfully involved their children in nazi summer camps. never did we really learn about the bolsheviks.

han34g3,2021-08-27T13:18:41.000-07:00,"trudeau campaign rally cancelled over security concerns amid protests so, if you look back to the 2015 election, alberta actually did give trudeau the benefit of the doubt. trudeau literally tripled his predecessor's popular vote totals in the province in his first election on a promise of balancing environmental and economic interests when dealing with the oil sector.

the trouble came afterwards. trudeau came to power with a friendly ndp premier, notley, who acted as the poster child for his environmental agenda, with the deal being that trudeau would get a pipeline in place to solve the impending pipeline crisis.

as background, oil sands production levels are set 5-10 years in advance, so anyone in the oil sector with a calculator knew that pipelines would reach capacity in 2018, causing a crisis if a new one weren't built. when trudeau took over in 2015, there were two lines scheduled for completion in time: northern gateway (approved by harper) and energy east (pending approval). trudeau cancelled northern gateway and killed energy east with moving-goalpost regulation. there's no doubt that a dozen advisors and lobbyists told trudeau that he was setting up an inevitable economic crisis in alberta, but he did it anyways.

alberta had every reason to turn on him for that decision. and, for progressives, it was even worse because the backlash against trudeau ended up resulting in notley losing office to kenney. after notley's early work with trudeau, when the pipeline crisis hit, kenney literally spent the campaign referring to notley as \"justin trudeau's ally\". progressives lost a lot of gains made in the province when the poster boy for progressivism in canada decides to screw the province over to help his election math.

overall, make no mistake, trudeau has more than earned the negative feelings that albertans have for him. if he had done anything nearly as damaging to ontario or quebec, i guarantee the hate would be flowing just as freely in those regions.",liberals
