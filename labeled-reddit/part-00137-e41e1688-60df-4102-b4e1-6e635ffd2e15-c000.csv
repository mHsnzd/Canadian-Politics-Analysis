liberalism is not leftist. when someone who is non conservative does something racist, mysoginistic or otherwise offensive they are called out. them the individual who did it. the difference is if an individual does something or if a group pushes an agenda. alt right wing groups are explicitly racist. they call for elimination of rights for and acts of violence against racial groups. that's not a few individuals those are the collective goals of the organization. that is not the same thing as individuals within a movement which does not advocate racism explicitly or implicitly being racist.",liberals

h3rk1in,2021-07-01T13:51:13.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] erin o'toole will have a worse performance in the upcoming election than all of the other conservative leaders since harper.

the reason i say that is that he has had a great deal of time to present himself as a better option than our current prime minister: he has completely failed to do so.

he doesn't come across as charismatic, every time he might be mentioned in the news it's either him attacking the government over something or because of some sort of bad idea or press that the conservatives have earned for themselves. case in point his \"climate change plan\". party members that i know learned about the plan at the same time everyone else was learning about it. no attempt at feedback from within the party, it didn't even seem like they really thought out what the areas of concern for the \"plan\" might be in terms of how they could get attacked on it.

you just have to look at some of the comments made on some of the conservative party youtube action plan videos to get an idea of just how popular he really is even within the party. i mean the best your party can do on youtube with some of its more recent announcements and videos is a few hundred views. that tells us you're losing the social media war more than likely.

at this point, they aren't ready for an election in terms of candidates. i expect a load of appointed candidates to be named soon.

the problem is: who exactly will end up replacing o'toole as leader once the next election is over? the party lacks good leadership and it needs that to pull its many parts together.",conservatives

&gt;i don't understand indigenous people. are they their own nations with sovereignty? if we include quebec, is canada some kind of contradictory composition of nested nations within nations? would it be a fair analogy to say canada is like israel and indigenous people are like palestine? 

i mean israel can't have a just cause while at the same time the situation of indigenous people of canada also having a just cause. they're contradictory. one has to be wrong. maybe it would be helpful to have indigenous people in canada debate with zionists. otherwise all of this rhetoric is nothing more than doublespeak.

edit: i got a vaccine shot today. i said to the lady: \"i have a theory about the vaccine rollout, do you want to hear it?\" she said \"sure.\" i said \" the reason canada has had such great vaccination rates so quickly is because at the beginning, when the vaccines were just coming out, canada couldn't get any and canadians got all up in arms 'how come they get vaccines but we don't?' this psychologically primed canadians to want something they couldn't have.

h3rlkxz,2021-07-01T14:06:17.000-07:00,"conservative support dips as liberals appear on steady road to majority: poll sure - here is a very very brief glimpse at a more wide ranging issue. 

lets get the easy stuff out of the way. money.  if chretien did one good thing for canada he capped donations individually and for companies/unions, and then the cpc wiped out the companies and unions too. that means if a party wants money it must appeal to and get financial support from it's individual members directly. so one way that supporters show their support of or opposition to a policy is with their chequebook. 

here's an example - in the 90's the liberals created the firearms laws and gun registry with bill c-68.  the cpc years later got in and tried to kill that bill. that's a long and bloody story (they were a minority for most of it) and they faced backlash from the liberal gun grabbers. 

to show support and to keep them going the firearms communites orgnaized a drive so that every donation sent in by a member ended in 68 cents.  so - 10.68 or 100.68. it was a way of conveying that getting rid of c-68's laws was heavily supported and continued support would mean more money. they got in thousands and thousands of donations with .68 cents. the cpc had been told about it, and it did not go unnoticed.  just one example - but it works even on an individual level 

  
example of this next one at the end if you don\"t feel like reading.  


but - setting aside that for now you have to remember that unlike the american system we don't vote for our prime minster. we vote for our local rep - and whatever party wins the most seats their leader becomes prime minister. in the states trump could have won the presidency but lost the house. that is not possible here 

so backbenchers actually can have a lot of power. and when you speak to your local representative or candidate, that can have a very large impact. i have personally seen it in action. the prime minister knows that if the riding is lost then he's one step closer to being out of power. so he's going to have to seriously consider whether he's pissing off his voters with any course of action, and if thats worth it. chretien lost power due to a backbencher's revolt that forced him out. 

now sometimes it is. maybe he pisses off 1000 people but the results of the policy are so good that 10,000 voters are happier. but - even then he has to be very aware that if he pisses them off again their voices will get louder and louder and that will cost him votes. so he either has to make it up to them somewhere else or do something to ease their concerns. 

example  - harper and the gays. harper ran for leadership partly on the idea that he would revisit the idea of gay marriage. he would actually make it a free vote so if you didnt like gay marriage elect a cpc govt and there you go. 

well... truth was not a lot of people in the cpc supported that. they wanted harper and elected him leader - but there was much pushback against the idea of a gay marriage vote. most people felt it was done, it wasn't worth discussing any more, the issue was settled and we had to move on. a lot felt the gays should have the right in the first place. so the majority were against revisiting it. 

harper got much pressure from the cpc voters and decided the fight wasn't worth it even tho he personally believed in it and he caved. he wound up holding a vote on whether or not to hold a vote very early in his first term :) of course it was defeated and they never had a vote on gay marriage and the issue never came up again. 

there are shit-tonnes of examples. but there's two from more recent history to chew on. we can actually put a lot of pressure on the leader if we want if enough people disagree with a policy. and if not enough do we have to accept that in a democracy we arent going to get our way all the time and require they make it up somewhere else.",liberals

well clearly to you it means something that is materially meaningless.

the central problem in all indigenous politics is that reservations are economically unviable (usually by design, as all the productive land was stolen by the colonizers). that's literally it. nothing will ever change for these communities until they are fully integrated into the capitalist mode of production. this integration may happen through either assimilationist or indigenous-nationalist ideology, but either way a drastic and fundamental change to the way they live is the only available route out of rural poverty.",liberals

but - i will say to get to that range you have to add the clean fuel tax (about 5 cents a litre) the new carbon tax (about 25 ish cents a litre) and the existing carbon tax about 11 -13 cent a litre when fully implemented). so as currently discussed just under 50 cents, plus we pay gst on the tax. so another 2 cents or so.  

but ... there are strong calls on the liberals right now to double that. they say even the new tax won't be enough, so various groups are lobbying hard to go from the 150 ish dollars per tonne he's proposing to 300. 

now - he promised it would never go above 50 a tonne. now he's tripling that. not hard to convince people he's lying about doubling it again. so - fully implemented and depending if he caves to the environmentalists in his party it'll be roughly 50 cents to a dollar. 

i will say this doesn't include his alleged 'rebate' part of the plan - but the fact is it also doesn't include the higher costs on literally everything including getting gas to the pump that the carbon tax will add which will be passed on to the consumer. and so far the tax hasnt been neutral, people got back less than they should have.",liberals

&gt; i especially hate the \"move to where it's less expensive\" bit. it's predicated on this weird notion that everywhere is the same, aside from cost. like, no, i live where i do for a reason, there are several factors that make other places a non-viable option, i didn't just move here by picking it out of a hat, y'know?

&gt; ultimately, canada isn't much like the us, in that there's not exactly a giant list of cities. in the states, if i get priced out of new york, i can move down the list to la, to seattle, to portland, to dallas, to, fuckin, i dunno, kansas city or something. there's a lot of options!

&gt; in canada, we've got, what, maybe 10 cities total before you start running into \"this town is small enough it won't have everything i need\"? less than that if you don't know french? obviously the list of what you need is different from person to person, but there's not many common things i can think of that you wouldn't find somewhere in calgary or ottawa, y'know?

&gt; so with that small of a list, once you start tacking on other conditions - \"needs good public transit\", \"needs jobs in my field\", \"has [x] covered under provincial health care\", etc etc, you're left with... not much choice.

&gt; i would move somewhere cheaper if i could. i can't. like, i can't drive so need good public transit, i need good trans-related medical coverage, and i can't speak french. my options are vancouver or toronto. where, exactly, am i supposed to go that's cheaper?",liberals

i'm going to disagree, not because the supply chain isn't messed up but i would argue that the supply chain issues are primarily caused by the unsustainable standardization of just-in-time and lean manufacturing and it was going to inevitably be thrown into chaos at some point, covid was just the catalyst.

no government, including harpers, has done any studies on immigration, on what numbers would be ideal, on what goals we should set for immigration to achieve or how best to tailor immigration to achieve those goals. no government has done any study on the impact of immigration so far, either on the economy, or on any aspect of society from housing demand and cost to healthcare costs to urban sprawl or social dysfunction.

because it doesn’t matter. the politicians support immigration because they play up to ethnic groups and want their votes. that is the only reason. there is no economic support behind immigration and that’s why the government never does any studies or documents any impact.

[an interesting article here](https://www.ourcommons.ca/about/procedureandpractice3rdedition/ch_04_1-e.html). in 1952 [saskatchewan ](https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1952/5/15/the-scramble-for-seats) was the main concern, hence the adoption of the “gardiner rule” that prevented provinces from losing &gt; 15% of their seats. that worked for two redistribution cycles, but by 1971 several provinces were facing loss of seats, precipitating the adoption of the ill-fated amalgam formula. 

i spent saturday afternoon reading 25 pages of [hansard from december 1974](https://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_hoc3001_02/751?r=0&amp;s=2), it’s interesting in hindsight to see who was right and who was wrong in that debate. tl;dr the progressive conservatives’ concerns were well founded, had we kept going with that formula the house of commons would be about 420 members in size following the 2021 census.",conservatives

my original answer has more to do with social and economic issues being entirely intertwined, so even if a conservative came into office with socially progressive views, they would still hurt disenfranchised groups through their economics regardless. the model i refer to is capitalism in general. it tends to heavily favour the already wealthy, as well as favouring the majority race, so in europe and north america it’s whites, in south america it’s people of colonial european descent, etc.",conservatives

that can’t possibly happen because by then we’ll be within quebec’s municipal elections. every single city in quebec will have elections. they are on an unchangeable 4 years schedule.

imagine the situation. municipal signs go up. then justin goes “amma let you finish but now is the best time to hold a federal election of all time!”.

do you vote for the asshole that called that election in the middle of an election?

you see it now even in the rhetoric from many ndp supporters, there is open disdain for the idea that any person working in the field, no matter how well educated, no matter how experienced, making good money. the mere fact that they aren't purely in an office building becomes a source of derision, where it is assumed that they must be uneducated, uncultured, and evil, this then permeates to an assumption of the entire province.",liberals

yes, resources are an issue, however you cannot excuse burrill here. he was leader for over a year and did a terrible job rebuilding the grassroots, and raising money. consider the position the trudeau liberals were in in 2015, they were also a 3rd party with limited resources and it didnt stop them because they actually did the work and got results.

dave was the most centrist leader. they performed best in cb and rural ns under centrist leaders (chisolm, dexter) than under left wing leaders (alexa, burrill) which makes me think it's pretty obvious he would have improved the situation. if you look at many liberal candidates in rural ns they actually increased or matched their vote share in most ridings. the pcs over performed because the ndp went from winning 20-40% of the vote to 5-15%, the same margin they went up by. this is because burrill is not a serious contender and everybody knows it.",liberals
