i'm  suspicious also of arguments  using stats from 'europe'. the european states are even more varied than the canadian provinces in their health care provision.   


in the uk, the promotion of the private system has degraded the public nhs system. health care is 'universally accessible', as mr o'toole will have it,  but the public system is a shame.     


i have no problem with private  boutique clinics for elective vanity cosmetics, but if people are paying for access to basic services we've taken a bad turn, taking a road where the wealthy are profiting off  misery and exacerbating the dysfunctional consequences of capitalism.

i mean you laid the blame for world hunger at the feet of rich people because of their profit motive.

&gt; i never said anything about expired foods, either. there's clearly a surplus in supply. maybe people don't get strawberries in winter and learn to check their privilege.


so what food waste do we use then? you frame the topic as though there is a fast supply of perfectly good food that can be transported to where it is needed. this isn't taking into account that a huge amount of food waste doesn't have a long enough shelf life remaining to be hauled across the globe. donated to local food banks maybe, but a lot of it isn't suitable for being moved to food insecurity hotspots. not to mention issues of dietary restrictions, since many food insecure populations follow cultural/religious dietary habits that would prohibit a lot of our leftovers even if it could be feasibly transported.

once all that is factored in, you'd also need to divvy up western leftovers into a relatively balanced and nutritional supplies, leftover bags of jelly beans and nutella aren't going to be a huge help for global hunger. this is all to say that the presence of wasted food is not indicative of a useful surplus that can be reallocated to the global hungry. 



now i'm sure not against providing food relief to where food insecurity exists, but i strongly dislike framing it as an inevitable result of markets, and rich misers holding back the bread of the world to the global poor. i think a much more practical solution would be extra funding for un relief efforts which are far and away the most effective programs for solving food insecurity. one of the biggest problems they face though is that lots of the places suffering from the worst food insecurity are suffering from warfare that makes feeding hungry people dangerous and difficult, such as yemen.",liberals

if you think a party leader in canada doesn't have personal armed security guards during a campaign, you're uninformed.

&gt; prime ministers and their families receive constant rcmp protection, while opposition party leaders only receive protective services during election campaigns.

&gt; federal ministers don't receive rcmp protection on a regular basis and are usually accompanied only by political staffers during public appearances. provincial ministers in quebec, on the other hand, are always accompanied by armed drivers who act as bodyguards.

the reason they'd rather shuffle him out of the situation is to avoid creating a bloodbath. you won't generally see them draw their guns unless someone else shoots first. best defense (outside of war, talking civilized society) is typically to run away.

the new amending formula after patriation is much more complex. most of the time it needs the support of 7 out of 10 provinces making up 50% of the population. this on its own is very difficult to achieve because premiers rarely want to lose power or even if losing power isn't on the table, they often try to use these negotiations to win more power in other ways. on top of this, some aspects of the constitution can only be changed with the approval of all 10 provinces which is pretty much impossible now because quebec will not agree to any changes without a certain list of demands being met which are untenable to most of the other provinces or the federal government.",liberals

what you said was that the last time was 2015. that is clear as a bell. then when corrected you doubled down on that for a bunch of posts trying pathetically to pretend you didn't say what you clearly said. 

&gt;since you are mathematically impaired, the last time (2019) was after the first time, which was 2015.


no, the 2015 election was not the first time. we did not throw out harper he quit. as i've said a bunch of times now - so 2015 was not the first time we tossed a leader. you keep on saying that and then claiming you didn't say that!

you keep trying to change what you said but you keep coming back and making the same fucking mistake!!!!  how dumb are you exactly? 

so you fucked up royally and doubled down and now are trying to triple down and fucked up again. no - 2015 was not the first time!!!! harper quit. 

proving that not only are you a moron, you're a lying sack of shit. you very clearly did mean what you said, you keep accidentally saying it again every time you deny it. you seem very fond of dishonesty - liberal supporter i presume?

&gt;you said we should sit in opposition once. 

i said sitting on the benches once instead of having a dishonest leader we can't trust is better. and that's true. and once is how many times we'd have to do it in order to elect a different leader.  it's pretty simple. we go thru a leadership process in order to toss a dishonest leader, we'll risk not being ready for one election.  i know you're having trouble counting up to one but i can't help with that.

heplbhf,2021-09-28T21:35:46.000-07:00,"gun-control group urges trudeau to name new minister to advance liberal promises there are few groups so willing to ignore data as the gun control lobby. they demand

&gt;meaningful consultations with chiefs of police, police representatives, organizations that fight domestic violence, public health and suicide prevention specialists, legal experts, victims organizations, hunters and guns stores

but this was done in 2019. it just didn't get them the results they were after. people, including non-gun owners, were overwhelmingly against a handgun ban and an \"assault weapon\" ban. i'd like to think people were against the assault weapon ban because they knew that assault weapons have been banned in canada since the 70s,but regardless, their claim that there is a clear mandate from the canadian people for more action on gun control is just not true and we have receipts.

in the published results from the public safety consultations, none of the further actions that people were asked to consider were particularly popular, but a ban *did* appear at the top of the list. that is, until you realize that \"target criminals,\" \"stricter consequences,\" \"enforcement of existing restrictions,\" and \"focus on illicit guns,\" total 45 per cent of the responses to this topic in relation to handguns. for \"assault weapons\" 40 per cent of respondents supported a ban, but again, these are already banned. i think it's also telling that the second place response is \"define assault weapons so we know what we're talking about.

there is simply no evidence that legal gun owners are a major, or even significant, contributor to gun crime. there is considerable evidence that canadian citizens, to their credit, overwhelmingly do not want the government to deal with gun crime by targeting legal gun owners.

source: https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/2019-rdcng-vlnt-crm-dlg/index-en.aspx

edit: i'm not happy with the part where i said \"40 per cent of respondents supported a ban\" on assault weapons. that's not really the case. for clarity, when asked if more should be done to limit access to assault weapons, 77 per cent of respondents said no. then, in a separate question, when asked what measures should be \"considered,\" 40 per cent said a ban should be considered. this is even less of an endorsement of a ban than i implied initially.

also of note are the sections asking \"where should we focus efforts,\" 0 per cent of respondents said on legal gun owners and \"what is most likely to be effective,\" to which only 6 per cent said a ban on handguns and 13 per cent said a ban on assault weapons. for both handguns and assault weapons, respondents overwhelmingly favoured \"target criminals, not lawful gun owners\" as the measure most likely to be effective, followed by every other measure that up's enforcement of current measures and gets illegal guns away from illegal owners and then, way down at the bottom, if all else fails, a ban.

finally, obligatory clarification that \"assault weapon\" is a stupid, loaded, fluid, border line meaningless term that adds nothing to this discussion.",liberals

as much as trudeau hasn't done everything right he hasn't gone around looking to pick fights with the provinces when they're having a tough time, ford certainly has started just that. ironically enough the evidence can be found in kenny not being in such a public open fight with trudeau at the moment. ultimately it comes down to trying to deflect political responsibility for what ford screwed up that legault ( on this wave ) and to a lesser degree horgan didn't.

  i think a sticking point would be the legality of doing this. i don't know if the provincial government really has the legal authority to essentially forcibly detain any and all people getting off a plane for two weeks. that would seem to contravene your basic freedom of movement rights. federally this can be done in certain circumstances yes, but i'm unsure if provincialy you can. i say this for two reasons, 1) the current lock downs and stay at home orders aren't punishable with jail time, only fines, yes the nonpayment of those fines can lead to potential jail time but not the actions of disregarding the lockdown (i think, again not a lawyer) so essentially anyone willing to pay the fine would be able to just walk out the hotel and that would be that. 2) look at what happened when ford tried to use the police to vigorously enforce the latest lockdown measures. most if not all major police departments basically said no, randomly detaining people on suspicion of breaking lockdown was illegal- yes not exactly the same situation but close enough.

on top of that using police to detain passengers to prevent strains being brought in would be an imperfect solution because there are more that just passengers and flight crew who would come into contact with a potential virus outbreak. think about the baggage handlers, the airport cleaners and the people who clean the planes and service them, they would all be susceptible to being exposed. would you have to permanently detain all of those people as well? if not then why not? they would be a health risk to the larger community would they not?

for example some one in france would be a reactionary if they wanted to for example go back to how things functioned right after the revolution. one could also be in france and be a reactionary and want things to be the same as it was before the revolution.

a reactionary in the usa, might want to join forces with the uk again, becoming a colony of the uk, under an absolute monarchy.

the word reactionary is pretty flexible, but it is not really a derogatory term. the problem with the op is, that they are trying to use the term in a pejorative way.

this would be like a republican in america using the word \"socialist\" to describe a moderate democrat that wants health care. the word is used in bad faith, to insult the person. the word isnt used accurately. that is the problem with the op. they are trying to bash the leader of the ucp.

if you want to understand what a modern reactionary would look like, you might want to check out the nrx movement. they are an interesting movement, with a lot of good insight(for us conservatives). they arent really extremists, but they are just very traditionalist doomers. that is the best way to explain it.

one of their videos of their leaders(guy with black long hair): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtlyyqzfh4w&amp;ab\\_channel=justinmurphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtlyyqzfh4w&amp;ab_channel=justinmurphy)

this line of criticism always seems so arbitrary. if he shows up to an event, he's distracting attention from indigenous voices and making it about himself, while if he lets indigenous groups take the lead and stays out of the public eye, he's proving himself to be insincere and a hypocrite. in other words, people will criticize him for the opportunity to criticize him.

whose past? 

canada is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual state comprised 95% of settlers and immigrants. do the afghan refugees fleeing canada this week need to atone to canadian indigenous or first nations groups? what about the families from haiti who moved here 10 years ago fleeing the earthquake-related collapse? what about the families from hong kong in 1997? what about the families from iran in 1979? what about the jewish families in the 1960s? what about the slav farmers in the 1910s? what about the chinese railway builders from 1890? or perhaps those immigrant groups were not at the centre of power so atonement is simply needed from the descendants of settlers in new france or, better yet, in upper canada?

exactly who owes atonement to indigenous and first nations groups in canada and what level of reparations are owed by each group? if you think everyone owes them, surely the afghan refugee of 2021 and the bounty hunter in 19th century nova scotia have different responsibilities here?

it's unfortunate that many canadians seem to be so poorly informed about our voting system.  i can't really think of significant improvements i would make to it, if the goal is reliable results that are credible to the public and free of political interference.

it's amazing what a little exposure to the actual process does for your understanding though, i worked as a scrutineer for one of the parties once back in my relative youth and it's impossible for me to reconcile that experience with widespread fraud there were observers from every significant campaign in my riding and it was about as unpolitical as a democratic process can be.  our elections are are simple and return reliable results that are observed and validated by all of the parties at every voting site.  there were no controversies, and every single unclear ballot was resolved quickly and without any dispute other than to clarify.  i assume that this is generally how our system is run across the country.  elections canada is imperfect, but it's practically the poster child of a lawful neutral bureaucracy that snaps into action whenever the politicians decide they want to go to the voters.  they do this in the name of public service, it's not a huge organization and it's not a stepping stone to lucrative private employment or powerful positions in the federal civil service.

that said, i think this does raise the broader spectre of generally low levels of civics knowledge among canadians.  i would think that the fact that voting machines are not used would be pretty obvious to anybody who has voted before.  combined with the fact that there are foreign actors in the middle of all of this actively sowing doubt for non-partisan and more nihilistic reasons, we need to get on top of this as a country if we don't want to see our entire system head down the same sewer that the american system has in recent years.

right now for the most part it's just loons on twitter and the closest thing to legitimacy they have are a few (mostly backbench) cranks in the conservative party, but its going to get worse and more pervasive if we just sit around expecting people to become better informed via youtube, social media and the like.  in the long run, the legitimacy of canadian democracy probably rises or falls with our ability to properly educate citizens about how things actually work and what's actually true, not what people are acting in bad faith say about those things.  this seems to be the central challenge to liberal democracy for the foreseeable future.",conservatives
