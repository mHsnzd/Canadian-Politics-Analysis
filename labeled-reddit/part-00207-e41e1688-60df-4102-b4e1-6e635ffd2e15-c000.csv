not exactly true. that would only be the case if you only cared about your riding, and then stopped thinking entirely when it comes to the big picture. if the liberals don't win a majority, we end up with a minority government where the next election is likely in 1.5-2 years, which presents another opportunity for the cpc to win.


if the liberals lose the seat count, but end up governing with ndp support, there will be a strong push in the media to label the government as illegitimate, and it could fall fairly soon after resulting in a cpc government.



i'm not saying these are the most likely outcomes, but they're very possible, and let's be honest canadians don't like minority governments. after 2015, most people were happy with the results, but after 2019 and 2021, most people were not. the point is, just because a riding has no chance of going cpc, doesn't mean strategic voters are in those ridings are bumbling idiots who need to be shown the light.",liberals

there is no other government action since the founding of canada that has created such a backlash among indigenous peoples. it was the moment that pushed loads of indigenous people and leaders into action. many indigenous organizations were created across the country in order to organize against the government, books written, people mobilized. nothing like this happened before, it was the start of the next-level of indigenous resistance in the country. from here, organizations and groups started advancing bigger policies and agendas and bands started taking more ownership over their programs and services from the feds. 

no other minister of indigenous affairs before him would have met such organized resistance, and probably none other since. to say he never heard anything about irs during this period is a bold faced lie. he is lying, full stop.

english media is probably bored and looking to stir up the good old classic \"quebec bad\" to spice things up. 🤷‍♂️

besides, this increased attention locally is nothing more than extension of debates between euro liberals and anglo american liberals. each other holds their interpretation of liberalism as less discriminatory than the other and writes articles that's nothing more than a holier than thou sermon.

i think it's time to admit that no one holds a monopoly on religious freedoms and liberty and multiple interpretations can exist. lacites stance on relegating religion into the private domain of an individual is equally valid as anglo secularism view that religion is an extension of one's individual expression. each interpretation asks society to make accommodations to fit their own definition.",liberals

a vote for the ppc is called a protest vote because the party (ppc in this case) aren't capable of forming government and more so aren't likely to elect an mp at all.  being able to cast a protest vote is reserved for the lucky.  the rest (who want to get rid of trudeau) don't usually  have that option.  some, in ridings that are overwhelmingly blue or orange could cast a protest vote and not worry that doing so would help elect trudeau.

**we abandon quebec**, and allow a quebec-based \"conservative party\" to take our place. as you yourself mentioned, quebec conservatism is very different than anglo conservatism. the cpc is trying to twist itself into knots in order to appeal to both, and risks losing either if the balancing act isn't perfect. so, why bother?

logically, a quebecois ran-and-focused party should be better able to appeal to their base than a prairies-based party could. given time, they would either absorb the bq or become their main rivals in the province as they lurch left in order to remain relevant.

once in parliament, form an alliance with them, and it would give the cpc the one thing we've always lack in the house: a natural ally. if the \"cpq\" and cpc have a majority, hey, presto, basically a majority government.

hnybfmw,2021-12-09T13:29:13.000-08:00,"new brunswick gets a $10-a-day daycare deal, leaving ontario as the lone holdout so, here is the direct quote:

[https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/11/15/10-day-child-care-families-alberta](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2021/11/15/10-day-child-care-families-alberta)

the prime minister, justin trudeau, and the premier of alberta, jasonkenney, today announced that both governments have reached an agreementthat will support an average of $10‑a‑day care in the province,significantly reducing the price of child care for families. theagreement includes creating 42,500 new regulated early learning andchild care spaces by the end of march 2026. with federal funding ofalmost $3.8 billion over the next five years, alberta will also see a 50per cent reduction in average parent fees for children under the age ofsix in regulated child care by the end of 2022.

&amp;#x200b;

1. by the end of 2026. 5 years. my daughter will be in grade 3 by then.
2. licensed child care providers that participate. alberta has a mixed market system, most will not be participating, including my own daycare, since it has strings attached. i spoke to them about it, they said, hassle not worth it, they make more privately.
3. there is means testing involved. if you read the full announcement, the mythical 10$ is applicable to 9 out of 10 families. read, low-income only same as everything else like cerb - i pay taxes, and more then most, wheres my 2k per month? oh, its for someone else only, of course. my mistake. oh they forgave everyone who fraudulently took cerb? of course they did, this is canada sir. but i digress.
4. full announcement also says, it will bring down average daily rate for childcare down by 50%. average rate now, is closer to 60-70$. so, down to 30-40? not quite 10, is it. and not for quite everybody. in fact, daycares in alberta had a meeting a while back, increased daily rates by 10$, just because they can. dayhomes too. my daycare increased prices by 10 and they arent dropping them next year, i asked. where is that 50% reduction by the end of the 2022.
5. did i mention dayhomes are not included, since they are not eligible due to how licensing works if you have less then 6 kids per day?

bottom line, its a lot of bla bla bla to fool people. what actually happens if you want to take advantage of this program, you discover its a bunch of shit and lies.

with conservative plan, i would have submitted invoices i pay, and gotten some rebate every year. at least i would have gotten something out of the system, instead of giving.

(i lived in 905, moved to alberta this year, know both situations).

&amp;#x200b;

edit - for shits and giggles i took a look at alberta's eligibility requirements for the 10$ thing - which in reality is around 600$ buck subsidy.

licensed daycares only, no dayhomes, and only if both parents are working. and yes there is means testing and income cutoff. so...yeah. i dont qualify. surprise surprise.",liberals

“erin o’toole’s survival as head of canada’s conservative party defies rational explanation. […] there’s no obvious rational argument justifying his continued leadership of the conservatives, just stubborn hope or passive resignation”. 

then, a few paragraphs later he cites “trust issues” being a factor that is preventing progressive canadians from giving the conservatives a chance.

so it stands to reason that there is a rational explanation about why the party leadership wants to keep o’toole. they think that he will be able to win canadians trust over the next 4 years by staying principled to the ideas that he brought up during the election and not flip flopping.

a.) continue to pander to the paleoconservative/populist wing of the party, eventually letting it completely take over, in witch case it'll become increasingly unlikely that the cpc ever forms a majority government ever again. (their disproportionate influence and both scheer/o'toole's leadership is already preventing them from doing that in the short term anyways) 

b.) move to the centre on social and climate policy and expand the party's base at the expense of abandoning paleoconservative and far-right populist interests.

they can't do both and eventually they'll have to pick one, or the choice will eventually be made for them. the harper stratagem was a temporary arrangement  made out of necessity to keep two radically different bases intact during the party's formative years, but i doubt that even harper himself think that the cpc should keep maintaining that system going forward in the face of a changing political climate etc.

for instance, even for as much flack as he gets on here, kevin o'leary was one of the few people in the 2017 cpc leadership election race who was openly emphasizing that the cpc needed to moderate on social issues and heavily expand it's base to remain relevant.

similarly, even some provincial social conservative leaders were seeing the writing on the wall and were moving their party's away from social conservatism and working on increasing their appeal to centrist voters such as the ontario pc's under patrick brown post hudak or alberta's wildrose party under brian jean etc, but in both cases, their bases used emergent political opportunities to put an end to that and elect more regressive candidates (ford/kenny) before those reforms could take place etc.

the bright side of the issue is that around 46% of party member supported the climate change initiative, which is a potential indicator that as the older party members start to cycle out, the younger replacements might eventually tip the scale. but if the cpc want's to be relevant now, they have to address the elephant in the room, which goes beyond climate policy.",conservatives

gs2pde0,2021-03-24T03:58:11.000-07:00,"when it comes to climate change, conservatives are in danger of becoming irrelevant first off, i appreciate the work that you put into that. i also appreciate that this sub is a little light on the conservative viewpoint, so it's nice to see a new poster.

i think you may have mistook the intent of my comment. i wasn't putting forward the thesis that the cpc is full of climate deniers. they are a larger percentage than supporters of any other major party, but i was trying to draw the contrast between canadian and american conservative voters. your thesis was that trump ran on a platform that opposed climate reforms and won, and concluded that the cpc in canada could do the same and increase their support. i disagree, and submit that this would reduce their support, with the further note that american and canadian politics are very different and that it's difficult to draw conclusions that span the two.

regarding your points 1 to 3, that represents (according the the same poll) 40% of cpc voters, while 40% say that it is primarily industrial/transportation. so i am going to dispute that the default conservative position is that climate change is happening and it is primarily natural. given that the question is worded in such a way that man-made causes are referred to by only a subset of what we produce, i would think it might actually undercount cpc voters that think it is primarily man made. either way, as lapsed\\_pacifist noted, the intent of the question is fairly clear, even if i could wish for better wording.

i am not going to get into whether or not anthropgenic climate change is real or not. this is settled science, and in any case is tangential to my point - that the cpc does not have gains to make by running on policies that oppose climate change initiatives, and in fact stands to lose a number of voters that they cannot afford to lose.

regarding research co. [538 seems to think they're ok, not great](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/). they seem to be in line with other canadian pollsters with [opinion polling for the 44th canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_44th_canadian_federal_election). i think you might be shooting the messenger.

notes:

1) i do think we could have our own version of trump win an election (though i can't think of anyone that currently could fill that role).

2) many factors led to trump's victory in 2016. i don't want to get too into the weeds on the whys of that, but i do think his stance on climate change was at best incidental to his victory.",conservatives
