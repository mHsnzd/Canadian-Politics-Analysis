i answered the question, both from a tax balance perspective and from a capital outlay perspective. 

&gt;what's the point of property taxes if they don't fund the infrastructure required by the property? 

all taxes are determined based on whether we consider the redistributive nature of them to be fair, not on whether their outlays pay for an allocated part of the budget. 

&gt;would any other business be expected to sell a product or service below cost just because it's the way it's always been done and the customer has no clue of the true costs involved? 

the province is paying for the taxes, it created municipalities because it wanted to. effectively the province chooses what items it will fund out of which budgets and which taxes will be collected where. governments are not profit maximizing organizations. they're not there to accrue as much revenue as possible, and have numerous other objectives. 

&gt;urban dwellers deserve a properly funded city with proper transit and proper infrastructure, rather than seeing their taxes used to subsidize other people's large lots and front lawns 90 minutes away.

urban dwellers deserve affordable housing. spending half a million extra per household is a straight up crime, and it is not justified by a minor swing in property taxes. toronto needs to build both up and out, with highways and transit, if it is going to solve this.",liberals

yes.  we need to build more generation. that's actually an opportunity.  but the amount of generation required for evs is vastly overstated. not only are evs way more efficient.  but evs generally charge off-peak.  so the additional load on generation is actually quite low. the average load for most across an average residential neighbourhood works out like everybody running an extra ac unit.  we actually have modeling on the additional power demand.  mckinsey forecasts an extra 1% by 2030 and 4% by 2050.  it's not nearly as much as people think.

guwj45h,2021-04-17T07:29:34.000-07:00,"‘a massive blow to his integrity and credibility’: conservatives blindsided by erin o’toole’s carbon pricing plan if you think our housing market isn’t effected by our carbon tax i have no idea what to tell you. you’re beyond lost.

where do you think the materials to build houses comes from? how do you think the vehicles residential workers use or get to work are powered? how do you think the houses are heated? 

do you think this is all carbon free? cause you would be... what’s that word... wrong.

“the experts say you’re wrong”

no, people who have a direct financial vested interest into reaching into our pocket say in wrong. the exact people who will be collecting the carbon tax. many many experts agree with me. 

“they’re intended to mitigate those costs”

but they don’t. case closed. it must be nice to live in a recession proof major city, while prostelytizint from a position of economic privilege. not everyone can bus into work. you’re arrogance and ignorance is exhausting.

“wrong ev’s bla bla bla”


you don’t seem to understand that, once again, we aren’t taking about just vehicles. we are talking about how we generate energy for our country, en masse. 

“unless it’s green”

ooooh my gaaaawd bro. you don’t get it. you just don’t get it.

tell me, what’s the “green” alternative to insulin? processors? power supplies? clothing? mouthwash? toothpaste? dental care? colostomy bags? medical instruments and machinery? seat linings? epipens? syringes? hand sanitizer? cotton, linen, wool, silk, denim , spandex, and latex? pesticides? life saving medications?

for the last time: literally over 7000 products that are used in wvery day life, by consumers, manufacturers, and so on, are dependant on fossil fuel manufacturing and that wont go away, because there is no green energy alternative! literally everything you see around you had fossil fuels somewhere in its manufacturing and the price of that will be offloaded onto us, the consumer!

for craps sake, i’m getting really impatient explaining this to you again. do you just, choose to remain willfully ignorant of facts that don’t feed your ideological biases?

“transport and power production are two of the most obvious realms carbon can be reduced”

no, wrong. transport, yes, but that’s not feasible for most of the country, as the overwhelming vast majority of people cannot afford a new electric vehicle, or they have to commute to work with a vehicle. even if they aren’t buying a new tesla, most people don’t have enough money at any point to buy an electric vehicle. thecheapest used electric vehicle in my city right now, is 19,000 dollars. you gonna supply these families with 19 grand when they are living paycheque to pay cheque? your privilege and arrogance and unwillingness to consider other perspective outside of you big city recession proof high income privileged bubble is absolutely jaw dropping. just jaw dropping ignorance. 

power production? wrong. the technology to produce more efficient power than fossil fuels does not exist yet, unless you count nuclear energy, but for some reason the naive idealistic lie-berals would rather tax us into poverty then convert from oil to nuclear. 


also, electric vehicles are exhorbitantly expensive. how the fuck is a family below the poverty line, living in a rural part of canada  supposed to buy an electric vehicle? 

you gonna supply them 80 grand for a tesla? or 15-20 grand for a use leaf? 

also, ev’s only start actually becoming green positive after 300k km on the road, because making the batteries that power them requires massive carbon emissions.

“you are a climate change denier”

no i’m not i’m just not an idealistic fool who thinks you can tax a nation into prosperity since it has never worked. 


using this same logic i could say:

you’re a moronic fool with a high school education who is utterly incapable of looking past his ideological evangelism. you are incapable of considering any other perspective than your own and you’re insanely ignorant privilege has blinded you to the struggles of your fellow citizens, to the point where you’re willing to fuck over the rest of the country so as to virtue signalling your climate ideals. 

but then i guess you would be a lie-beral if you didn’t think this way.

the ndp didn't want to do that because they knew this election was going to be called; everybody in ottawa knew it would be. so instead of ensuring that bill passed before this election, jagmeet singh refused to support a fast track of the bill. that way, singh could point to the liberals and say that they didn't keep their promise, that an election was more important than helping gay and trans kids.

to score a political point in an election campaign, your guy threw gay and trans kids under the bus. **yes. he. fucking. did.** 

singh played politics with the lives of gay and trans kids. that's what he did. these is no spin on that. look at it. that is who these people are. they are not more principled, they are not more honest - they are just as greedy, and shitty, and prone to lie as anybody else. and given the exaggerated pretense of moralism that the ndp has -- that makes them more dangerous than any other party in ottawa.

the ndp threw gay and trans kids under the bus for politics. that's what the ndp did. that's not a maybe. **that's a fact.**  that is who you want to have the balance of power in ottawa.

hol5ave,2021-12-14T09:21:29.000-08:00,"trudeau open to discussing decriminalization of hard drugs because they aren’t similar problems. one doesn’t become addicted to having a gun. having a gun isn’t a medical problem. don’t get me wrong, i think that fixing the gun problem requires far more than just blanket banning guns, but the two problems are in completely different realms.

also to your assumption about why decriminalization of drugs would help the problem, it’s true that what you said is part of the goal, but it’s only a small portion. some other reasons for decriminalizing drug use are: increasing likelihood of users getting medical attention when needed (no longer afraid of being arrested when calling for help); preventing further harm to already marginalized communities; reducing interactions with police; potentially offering safe (or safer) supply; providing more (and increasing the use of) safe use sites; and even without any major resource reallocations, the cops would have more time to target larger scale criminals (such as gun smugglers or drug dealers).

i understand how these issues may seem very similar, but i think part of that similarity comes from the fact that drug use has (at least up until now) seemed like a criminal problem when it’s more of a health problem. changing that perspective helps to understand why drug decriminalization will help, and what makes drug use different from gun crime in that regard.

&gt; bonnyville-cold lake-st. paul mla dave hanson, chestermere-strathmore mla leela aheer and calgary-fish creek mla richard gotfried were opposed to changes within the bill which would allow wealthy donors to purchase party memberships in bulk to influence leadership votes and nomination races without the consent or knowledge of the recipients. 
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; the [upc mla's] proposal [to amend the bill] never made it to the legislature floor.
&gt; 
&gt; a time allocation motion limited debate to one hour. deputy house leader joseph schow, municipal affairs minister ric mciver, justice minster kaycee madu and government house leader jason nixon tried to eat up the time by speaking to a different amendment introduced by the ndp. 

&gt; source: [3 ucp mlas vote against bill 81 over bulk membership purchase issue](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/3-ucp-mlas-vote-against-bill-81-over-bulk-membership-purchase-issue-1.6278371), cbc news.

it's worth remembering that this fits with the pattern of the past, which alleges that associates of jason kenney purchased memberships on behalf of albertans who (1) did not know that they were members of the ucp and (2) did not recall voting in the leadership race. from 2019:

&gt; cbc news contacted a dozen people with suspect emails attached to their memberships who confirmed they did not vote in the leadership race, and who said their emails were different from the ones on the list.

this law doesn't affect that, however it is useful to keep in mind given the potential pattern with bill 81.

subsequently, kenney's government made the election ombudsman, who was investigating these irregularities, redundant:

honlhdk,2021-12-14T23:40:39.000-08:00,"canada's home prices will rise 10.5% by the end of 2022, no immediate answer says liberals the policy agenda to reduce housing costs is simple and well-known

1. **increase housing production**: urban planning rules mean apartments and townhouses are effectively banned in most of the canadian metros. this results in shortages of housing and prices go up.
2. **end homeowner subsidies:** capital gains exemption, homebuyer incentives, homebuyer plan, and more all serve to dump more cheap credit into the housing market, increasing prices. property taxes are quite low in comparison to other countries, are highly efficient (especially lvt) and mostly hit the wealthy
3. **build more affordable housing:** literally the most direct way to address the problem. the government can acquire land, and build new homes to be rented at affordable rates. with ultra-low borrowing costs and the ability to upzone for itself, affordable housing could be delivered at scale for little cost
4. **tackle financial speculation:** part of the reason real estate prices are so high in canada is that homes have become speculative financial assets. banning flipping, reforming bidding processes and taxing investment properties would reduce this.
5. **make renting a viable option:** buying a house is not necessarily the right financial decision for a lot of people, but they do it anyway because renting sucks. improving tenant rights and stability would stop pushing people towards unnecessary homeownership and debt.

this agenda spans all levels of government, but the federal government is the most important actor. cities systematically lean towards limtijg development and the federal government needs to create very strong financial incentives for them to add housing. for example, conditioning transit funding on allowing more homes and creating financial incentives for permitting new units.

the tax and subsidy reforms largely lie at the federal level and funding for affordable housing remains paltry compared to spending on homebuying subsidies.

&gt;who sets up rules on frontage, density, etc., on said land? 

see above. 

&gt; who sets up rules on frontage, density, etc., on said land? why it's the provinces that do all that. do you want the federal govt to override provincial jurisdiction to force builders to make more houses? 

suuuuuuuurrrreeee... because developers have to be 'forced' to make money. no way they'd want to on their own. the hate profits. \"more red tape, less earnings!\" that's their mantra right?

sometimes i think your head is so dense it's one bad idea away from collapsing into a black hole. 

&gt;not quite sure why all the fuss on the federal policies but nothing on the provinces who actually make the rules on where and when homes are built.

well there's an element of truth to that. despite your weirdo ramblings the feds absolutely can have a massive role to play and should be showing proper leadership, but it is absolutely also true that there is much the provinces can do to improve the situation as well, and they haven't come under the same amount of pressure by and large. part of that i think is that when they did get pressured many provinces took action that 'looked' serious but was of no value, such as vacancy taxes and luxury home taxes and foreign buyer taxes. all of which made them look like they were taking action but really those measures proved to be utterly useless. 

so part of it is that we've been focused on the wrong things. the public have been focused on making other people buy fewer homes rather than increase supply. hopefully that's changing. but yes, the provinces should be pressured to do more in that regard as well and to work with the feds to come up with a co-ordinated effort.",liberals

&gt;trudeau admits that the retooling took longer than he expected.

&gt;“so much of what we had to do, from 2015 to 2019 was shifting the system that had been … not as active in terms of transforming the country, as i felt a canadian government needed to be,” he says. “so we had to sort of retrain the public service a number of ways. we had to empower them in ways that they had been disempowered. we had to figure out how to get things to happen on the ground in terms of infrastructure.” 

i mean, this is sort of why people are skeptical and cynical when it comes to parties in power. that's an extremely cynical answer to a pointed and direct question and such an obvious dodge does more to undermine faith in the government than any party pointing out their record on progress. it's a universal politician thing, to pivot to talking points regardless of context, but it's also something entirely under his control to change. 

remember when the minister of democratic institutions couldn't answer a simple question about [mandate letter](https://ipolitics.ca/2017/03/09/gould-dodges-mandate-letter-timing-questions/?doing_wp_cron=1639585240.1074359416961669921875) timing because the truth was slightly damaging? does that not spark immense cynicism? watching a minister try to gaslight her audience? insisting she answered the question when it is clear to anyone and everyone listening that she didn't? the difference between her and [michael howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqu77i40ms0) is that the latter had someone hold him to account.  

oh hey it's [part](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-question-period-ethics-commissioner-1.4108903) of a [pattern](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/karina-gould-dodges-question-on-replacing-electoral-system/) of selective hearing and avoiding confronting obvious issues by simply ignoring them.

nevermind that back in 2009, peter milliken (the speaker at the time) made a point to note that any compromise or deal on the matter had to be unanimous, as parliamentary privilege couldn't just be wiped aside and bypassed based off of the actions of a few. every parliamentarian has the same rights regardless of what the executive if the day might say.

parliament has the right to documents. trudeau, the opposition and the cpc speaker in 2009 agreed on that, and the opposition and the lpc speaker agree on that today.

you certainly gave me a lot to think about! so what's the ideal for you? i'd like to get a better understanding of what that is. is it completely removing suburbs altogether and moving everyone into apartments in a city with no cars, and everyone gets around by bike, walking, or public transit?

or is there some sort of compromise?

personally, my ideal is we work towards creating new cities of around 100,000 population each for wfh employees (or growing existing cities like north bay). it starts off as mainly a wfh economy, then other sectors slowly move there over time. at that size you can have the majority be detached houses without too much sprawl, but also include some other types of housing if you want, because i do recognize that even though most people prefer detached, there are people who would rather have something else. there can still be public transit, but at 100,000 people, there wouldn't be too much of a burden from cars either. to me, that's an ideal population for amenities and lifestyle.

are you saying a city like that just wouldn't be sustainable because infrastructure for detached houses is too expensive? how do places like kingston and guelph exist? there has to be more to this equation than we're considering.

i just think that if nobody drove cars, we would miss out on so much. sometimes those local stores in the city cores charge higher for the convenience. when you buy just one or two items, you don't notice it as much, but it adds up over time. instead you can drive to costco and save a lot of money.

it's also fantastic to have the flexibility to drive wherever you want, whenever you want. getting to more rural areas is particularly challenging with public transit.",liberals

most people in canada (including québecois) do not understand that the bloc québecois is a political party who's sole purpose is to create conditions favourable for an independent québec on a federal level. when y-f blanchet says things like \"questions arise\" about omar alghabra's past without being at all specific, he's hoping that someone like you types out what you did and that a soft nationalist francophone québecois will read it and react badly.

after all, you very clearly stated that québecois are hateful. more importantly, he's hoping for the canadian press to say exactly the same thing, preferably over and over again. when they inevitably do (clicks!clicks!clicks!), he'll very publicly point towards ottawa and say, \"see how they insult us? see how they seek to control us?\"

the bloc should have asked is if the minister will repudiate hamas and hezbollah who are still recognized in canada as terrorist organizations. and report to the rcmp anyone supporting said two organizations.

who the canadian arab federation have publicly supported. facts are facts. 

for those not aware, the canadian arab federation is an antisemitic organization that supports hamas and hezbollah. these two organizations hate jews (not just israel) and are terrorist organizations under canadian law.

it resulted in the government reducing their funding. which the caf sued the government for discrimination. and caf lost.

alghabra criticized the government's decision in the house. however stated it's the government's decision on who they wish to fund. 

so it's a valid concern to know if an mp, let alone a minister, supports terrorist organizations based on the fact an organization he supports and previously led also does so. 

the canadian arab federation really should be shut down. i can't image a white supremist organization being provided funding to help recent immigrants acclimatize to canada. nor should they. 

so overall, i can't tell if the bloc is just inarticulate incompetents  or if they are racist. given the fact that they have accidently voted against themselves, i will go with the former. never attribute malice what can be attributed to incompetence.

louis c.k.? returned to standup 2 years after his scandal, has a movie comedy special on his website. j.k. rowling? still makes a large amount of money off of her intellectual properties and is free to donate to as many transphobic causes as she wishes.

monica lewinsky, a prototypical example of \"cancel culture\"? she can barely move in online life without attack, and regardless of whatever else she planned to do in life is now an advocate against cyberbullying because well, when life gives you lemons.

if you're a person of colour, especially if you're a woman of colour, you're significantly more likely to face actual repercussions for being \"cancelled\". white men often barely feel a professional dent, and occasionally make up for it with a \"comeback.\"

when it comes to historical figures, i reject the notion that looking at them through an unvarnished lens is \"cancel culture\". we are continually told about the good things our political figures did, with little to no focus on what bad things they did. that's a problem. we need to examine and acknowledge the whole of these people if we are going to take any steps toward being a better country, with better people in it.

if that means we look at their stories and start asking \"why do we have this man on a pedestal?\", i think that that's not only healthy, but necessary. statues, street names, building names, they all attribute to the deification of figures in our past. we can acknowledge the good that was done with these men at the helm without turning to sainthood, or \"great man\" ideology.",liberals

pay attention.

the argument is that tyranny of the majority is not a valid reason to support this or a valid reason to enact these laws.
