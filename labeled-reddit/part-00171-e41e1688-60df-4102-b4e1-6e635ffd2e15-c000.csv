no, i am comparing two politicians that told others not to travel during the height of a pandemic only to turn around and travel themselves and tried to cover it up.

&gt;[while we continue to feel the impacts of #covid19, it’s important to remember that now is not the time for gatherings with family and friends. connect with others with a phone call or video chat instead.](https://twitter.com/pattyhajdu/status/1249354671745052674?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw%7ctwcamp%5etweetembed%7ctwterm%5e1249354671745052674%7ctwgr%5eshare_0%7ctwcon%5es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3a%2f%2ftorontosun.com%2fnews%2fnational%2ftrudeau-health-minister-flew-friendly-skies-more-than-thought-during-covid-lockdown)

the complaint is that these politicians travelled while telling others not to. although i am not surprised that it suddenly isn't hypocritical when a liberal did it. 

to me it doesn't matter what party the person belongs to, if they tell people to do one thing and then take steps to hide the fact that they did it themselves it isn't a good thing. i guess to some others it only matters depending on the party they belong to.",liberals

i remember it started as a block of trudeau and two premiers (one was bill davis of ontario) meeting a block of eight premiers (including levesque).  and after each of those four days the media would come out with new lists of which premiers were aligned with each other.  and every day the lists of premiers in each block were different from the previous day.

but the guy who started the \"backstabbing\", the first premier who abandoned the other premiers with who he'd come to the negotiations with?  that first backstabber was levesque - trudeau offered him something he wanted, and he ditched the other 7 premiers he'd come to the negotiations with.

after 4 days levesque ended up the odd man out.  but he was the one who started the \"backstabbing.\" (really \"haggling\" would be a better term but gotta have our hyperbole).  levesque had no one else to blame but himself for the way things turned out.

all of this fits into one sentence in the article you linked to - it's a more detailed description of

well it objectively is, people are not starving to death on minimum wage, we have a system of supports outside of the wage you get paid.

the liberals have been prepping for this election for months (or even a year). they have a lot of money,  dedicated volunteers, clever strategists, and trudeau himself is an extremely hardworking campaigner. 

last campaign singh wasn’t determined to be a threat, the bar was extremely low. even with the late ndp surge, they still lost many seats. this time around, the ndp can’t go much lower than where they are, and so the threat they pose to a liberal majority is much more dangerous. singh himself is also a good campaigner but he hasn’t had to face much scrutiny the way his opponents have. 

this is all to say that the liberals are not going to ignore the ndp and singh this time around. we can already tell trudeau isn’t about to play the same game the ndp is trying to play. the ndp quite obviously want to focus on taxing the rich and improving canada’s social safety net, they’ve made that obvious for months. but the hints we get from recent pronouncements and the timing of the call suggests the liberals want to focus on covid-19, vaccination requirements, and competency.

i have literally said multiple times we need to be lobbying and putting international pressure on the big four. that’s what our focus needs to be on, not taxing people into poverty. 

do you just see one thing, and then glean something entirely different? stop straw manning, it’s unbecoming.

honestly you’re probably pretty young so i’ll forgive your naive idealism, but rest assured that’s what you are. naive, uninformed, and idealistic.

in twenty years when we have no middle class, our way of life is innate poverty, and no one can afford anything due to rampant inflation and unnafforable taxes in everything , aka a socialist hellscape, will you keep up with the naive idealism?

“nothing about the federal backstop taxes people into poverty”

buddy, we are already seeing a housing crisis. our food and housing and amenities are already exhorbitantly expensive and taxes are sky high and rising. 

are you living with your head in the sand? i explained very clearly how the carbon tax will fuck canadians over, and do absolutely nothing to stop climate change.

“you get a rebate for the tax. free money rocks”

hooooly craaaap the fact that you think this money is free is exhaustingly, disgustingly naive. there is no such thing as free money, and you absolutely will be paying much more than you get back. who do you think should spend your money? you? or the federal government? you think they are just gonna take a bunch of money, mov it around, and give 100% of it back? where the fuck is the money for these “green initiatives” going to come from then? we either print it, which means inflation, or they take it from the taxes, which means a higher cost of living, when the cost of living is already insanely high.

“where there are extra subsidies”

ok now i know you’re a child, because you clearly have no fucking clue what you’re talking about. those “subsidies” absolutely do not cover the extra cost of living and if you had spent any time outside of your recession proof big city you would know those subsidies do not cover the cost of living. just aggressive, profound ignorance. 

“they just aren’t as convenient as fossil fuel yet”

no they aren’t as profitable, or efficient! convenience is irrelevant. the technology doesn’t exist to have 100% green competitive energy which will fuel our demands as a society. 

either we reduce our quality of life greatly, or we get taxed out the asshole. 

you don’t seem to understand how much the carbon tax will actually effect. you know it’s much more than just fuel prices in your car right? like literally everythingwill go up, including housing. over 7000 daily products that you use every day are made wil carbon fuels. from your toothpaste, to your clothes. from your food to your medications. 
so no there isn’t a green alternative. there is no green alternative to this manufacturing. a competitive infrastructure and technology doesn’t exist. the only places where it does exist are countries with unique national resources , like iceland with geothermal energy.

what, you expect poor people living in trailers or on a res to buy a fucking new 80 thousand dollar tesla to go green? are you stoned?

so the point you are making is that we went into recession much later than most other countries?

https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/recession-of-200809-in-canada

\"oil prices continued to surge during the first months of 2008, and the canadian economy was at first little affected by the us recession: employment and output continued to expand. but the us financial crisis in the fall of 2008 affected global financial markets, and canada was not exempt from its effects. the collapse of the prices of oil and other canadian commodity exports compounded the effects of the financial crisis, and the canadian economy fell into recession in october 2008\"

so we went into recession in q4/2008 well after most other global countries and overall our recession was milder than the us and europe

\"although the effects on canada were milder than on the united states and in europe, the canadian recession of 2008–09 was still severe enough to generate sharp declines in output and employment and to require significant responses by canadian policy-makers.\"

we were talking about whether it infringed a right, which is a step along the way to it being unconstitutional under the *charter*. like any court decision, we can disagree about whether it's right, but i'm saying there's a reason the notwithstanding clause was used.

&gt; maybe this teacher expressing her religious beliefs was not appropriate for the class?

i totally agree, and i'm sorry you had to suffer through that. but what were they wearing at the time? would it have been better if they dressed differently? let's not conflate clothes with actions. why not aim a law at workplace behavior, or restitution for past wrongs? bill 21 does nothing to stop an extremist jw from being in authority.

&gt; to me, religious freedom and anti-discrimination should mean that the government can’t single out and target your religion or religious practices directly.

the problem there is that you can have \"colorblind\" laws that have very targeted impacts. for example, imagine a law requiring every teacher to eat a cheeseburger. it would apply the same to everyone. but it would root out observant jews and hindus. a big part of black disenfranchisement during us reconstruction was tying voting to \"neutral\" property holdings.

france: similar to germany, they have employment based sickness funds, and the actual \"private insurance\" is used to cover the copayments, and non covered benefits such as dental care. it's meant to be supplemental, and it does not allow you to skip the lines.   


  
netherlands: similar system to germany, except you can't get substitutive private insurance and you must choose a public insurance company. private insurance here is again used to pay for things not covered in the public system like, dentals or vision for adults. it also doesn't allow you to skip lines.   


japan: again, another multi payer system, but here, private insurance works differently than the previous 3 countries. in japan, private insurance works as a way to provide cash benefits or lump sum payments in times of sickness. it does not cause 2 tier care.

trudeau is from quebec
both hate alberta, trudeau with deep long standing rants about how quebec is canada and how the west in power is bad for everyone, deep seated, core beliefs against pretty much the rest of the country, but specifically alberta.
when the last trudeau tried to ruin canada the rebound lasted fifty years, let’s hope we get a chance to rebound.

the political parties and money in politics needs to go, we need a team canada approach, no other province should take away the right for another province to make money and equalization helps those in need it doesn’t fund surplus extras that are not sustainable long term.

real change is needed, a new canada, we are so divided and truly a crappy country who still clings to what we were…we were a nation now just a nation divided.",liberals
