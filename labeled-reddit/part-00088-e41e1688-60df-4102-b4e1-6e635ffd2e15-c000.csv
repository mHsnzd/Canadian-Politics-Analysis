i don't really agree that they're declining in relevance if you count what their provincial counterparts have been doing, particularly in atlantic canada. the green brand is still growing, albeit slowly. i suppose it depends on how you define irrelevance, but i'll tell you one thing, the liberals certainly don't consider any of these parties irrelevant. they attract money, activist energy, and votes, all of which might go somewhere else instead. and i doubt that is going to stop, even if it gets set back.

i still don't really know what major holes you're referring to, but i have no doubt that the liberals actively pursued atwin, who was already getting chummy with some of their backbenchers. that's politics. it is a genuine coup for trudeau and the liberals. paul's suggestion that it's somehow anti-feminist or even just unsporting for the liberals to recruit her in this fashion is kind of like her assertion that they shouldn't have run a candidate against her in the toronto centre byelection - hopelessly naive *at best.*

but i would say that your lack of understanding would easily be resolved by taking the rpal course. it’s a weekend and a hundred bucks. 

all firearms have serial number so they can be traced. 

all handguns in canada are registered with the rcmp and by definition are legal. this is opposed to the unregistered handguns that are by definition illegal. 

my understanding from the stats available is that firearms that are used for fell intent is roughly 80% imported from the u.s. where they were legal under the u.s. jurisdiction but immediately became illegal once they were illegally smuggled. so technically true in a certain sense but kind of missing the point. they were always illegal under canadian law. 

they know this because the serial numbers are easily traced back to the u.s. and were not properly imported hence illegal by definition. 

the other roughly 19% or so are “unknown” origin. which means that it would take up far too many, much needed resources to track down where they came from so…. maybe? these are probably bring backs from before registration and not registered so again legal made illegal by lack of registration but a semantic difference that resolves nothing.

there is a small percentage that were legal but were reported stolen which immediately became illegal by the theft. in this instance i’ll kind of concede half a point but this is the very thin reed that you are hanging your entire argument on. 

the markets are distinct because the legal firearms owners do not purchase illegal firearms nor do they sell them to non legal owners. they have no need to. there is adequate supply to meet demand. 

again, if you are aware of a counter example please call the rcmp. i am aware of only one instance where a legal firearms owner that tried to sell to non legal owners but he was not successful and i believe in jail. 

if it were true that the markets were the same it would show up in the stats but i see no evidence of it. there would be far more registered handguns showing up in the stats. there are distinctly different buyers and sellers and the products are different. 

i get that “people like you” (lol) want to drive your policy desires on the power of nightmares, bad data, and motivated reasoning. i’ve lived through enough moral panics to see one. unfortunately you will probably get your way but you won’t get the results that you desire but you will feel better which is all that matters. and everyone will wonder why there are still firearms deaths like it’s a big mystery. 

the funny thing is i feel the same way about cars and alcohol that you do about guns. the only difference is that cars and alcohol are far higher causes of preventable deaths than legal firearms but we just have no ability to rationally evaluate risk so the real carnage will continue.

the major difference between cars (and to a lesser extent alcohol) is the intended use. guns are literally designed to kill things. that's their entire purpose in life. cars are designed as a tool to get people and stuff around, they've got significant licensing requirements, learning requirements, insurance requirements, and even the manufacturing is heavily regulated to include safety systems. we're also constantly trying to make them even safer by imposing new restrictions. 

i'd love to see alcohol more restricted, but due to the ease of making it that's unfortunately not realistically possible. that doesn't mean that we haven't added more drunk driving enforcement, changed over to breathalyzer interlocks for offenders, etc. though i think we could do more here.

the collapse in oil prices was part of it, but earlier mismanagement of the state oil company played a major role.

[enrique krauze](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/03/08/venezuela-hell-fiesta/), writing in the new york review of books:

&gt; in the spring of 2017, and all through the year, social media feeds in venezuela were filled with images of deprivation and despair: long lines of people hoping to purchase food; women fighting over a stick of butter; mothers who could not find milk to buy; children picking through garbage in search of something to eat; empty shelves in pharmacies and stores; hospitals without stretchers, drugs, or minimum levels of hygiene; doctors operating on a patient by the light of a cell phone; women giving birth outside of hospitals. venezuela’s economy, the economist ricardo hausmann wrote in a recent study, is suffering a collapse that is “unprecedented” in the western world. between 2013 and 2017 the country’s national and per capita gdps contracted more severely than those of the us did during the great depression and more than those of russia, cuba, and albania did after the fall of communism.
&gt;
&gt; this is a humanitarian crisis of immense proportions. by may 2017, venezuela’s minimum monthly wage wasn’t enough to meet even 12 percent of a single person’s basic food needs. a survey of 6,500 households by three prestigious universities showed that 74 percent of the population had lost on average nineteen pounds in 2016. infant mortality in hospitals has risen by 100 percent.

pdvsa, the state oil company:

&gt; in 1998, as the development specialists ramón espinasa and carlos sucre note in their recent study of the venezuelan oil industry, pdvsa employed 40,000 people and produced 3.4 million barrels of oil per day. by the first decade of the twenty-first century, it projected it would be producing 4.4 million barrels per day. it operated autonomously and by law deposited its profits in the country’s central bank. with chávez’s election, all this changed. he ordered that pdvsa personnel be hired for their political credentials rather than their technical skills, and that oil be sold at highly discounted prices to latin american countries sympathetic to his administration.
&gt; 
&gt; in december 2002, the employees of pdvsa went on strike. the government responded by stripping the company of its administrative autonomy, nullifying the exchange agreement that required pdvsa to sell all foreign currency resulting from the sale of oil to the central bank, and handling those resources discretionally itself, outside the budget approved by the venezuelan national assembly. roughly 20,000 employees were dismissed, two thirds of them with technical and professional skills. in the years that followed, pdvsa became a super-ministry; it distributed food, built houses, and managed some of the 1,400 businesses that chávez frenetically nationalized starting in 2007. during chávez’s presidency, it came to employ three times as many people as it had before 1998. its productivity, on the other hand, fell significantly; it produced 700,000 fewer barrels per day. this reduction was masked in part by the surge in oil prices that began in 2002 and peaked in 2008 at $147 per barrel.
&gt;
&gt; ... oil revenues remained high for four years, and chávez used these revenues to spend more than ever. each year he left a public-sector deficit of around 10 percent of the gdp. between 2014 and 2015 — by which point oil prices had collapsed, chávez had died, and nicolás maduro had succeeded him as president — those deficits reached 20 percent of the gdp.
&gt;
&gt; the government justified such spending by wagering that the price of oil would simply continue to rise. in 2008 alí rodríguez araque, one of chávez’s main advisers and at that time minister of finance, told me that the price would go as high as $250 per barrel.",liberals

the media would share he made advances on underage women. and only in the article would it state that they were underage for drinking. not for the age of consent. the women were 18. but anyone reading the headlines would read it was with \"underage\" implied as 16. really greasy media.

that may rankle some liberal supporters, but here are the facts: the hall report in 1964 recommended the inclusion of pharmaceuticals in canada's health system, but the liberals took it out of the bill over the objections of the ccf. in the *55 years* since medicare was passed, the liberals have governed for 35 of them, in which time they have never attempted to pass pharmacare. this includes the most recent 5 years of the trudeau government, which included the promise in both its election platforms, but has so far taken virtually no concrete action to make it happen. in their first term, they produced a very good report, which predictably came to the same conclusion as every previous report - that canada should have universal pharmacare. the report outlined a detailed plan for implementation, which the liberals have thus far not adopted in any way. i am recounting this history to make one point undeniably clear: *the liberal party is never going to pass pharmacare without being forced.* 

the vaccine rollout has left the liberals in a moment of weakness. they do not want to go to election while canada lags the rest of the world in its vaccination program. once this situation is rectified, it seems likely the liberals will almost certainly call an election, seeking a majority. if they achieve this (and they probably will), the leverage will be gone and pharmacare will not happen. **this is the moment** that the ndp needs to make its move. pharmacare is an issue that is worth spending this political capital on and the jagmeet singh needs to be willing to pull the trigger if it's necessary to force the liberals' hand.",liberals

of course we can and we're seeing some effects via the carbon tax.  we've seen oil and gas receive subsidies for years, we can (and arguably should) pivot that spending to green alternatives. another option would be to open government-funded research facilities with any patents funding future work. iirc, we've done this in the past. 

&gt; and how would you convince people to not better themselves and their situations?

we show them how it will improve their situation and actively start countering misinformation instead of letting it slide the way that we have been. it's not fast, just as seeing the impacts of past policies has taken decades. 

&gt; no reasonable person denies that.

i'd argue that while a reasonable person may not deny that, companies making the move to employing part-time workers and contract staff to avoid paying benefits (as well as union-busting) would indicate that people are okay with reduced productivity and its economic impacts. at least, as long as the short-term gains show on the company balance sheet. 

&gt; i don't know who's saying that or what their agendas are. but that sounds awfully a lot like some oil baron would go around saying. that's nonsense, and they just want to keep raking in the profits while hampering the competition.

the conservative party of canada among others which yes, includes oil and gas companies. i agree that it's nonsense, but their supporters argue otherwise.

&gt; yes, perhaps those products are not ideal just yet, but what needs to be done is to make their production costs cheaper. we need to improve the engineering behind them, pump money into those initiatives, make it competitive against plastics.

they're actually viable alternatives (i've even seen some for medical uses such as iv bags), but yes, more expensive currently than the alternatives. the environmental impacts aren't even being considered, though we'd also have to invest in commercial compost facilities across the country in order to properly compost them. that would create jobs though and reduce the \"recycling\" that we ship out of the country for processing.

&gt; reasonable to you and me, perhaps, but we are not the world, and we are acutely aware of the problems with these things. most people do not care or want to find out. their interest in these things will only exist when it starts to affect them personally.

which is why i believe that the government needs to take a firmer hand on changing which companies they support and lead the way to encourage change because as time goes by, it will only get worse and harder to change. 

&gt; telling people to just deal with no economic growth and no growth of their fortunes isn't going to cut it.

or we can prove that there will be economic growth and their situation can improve? retraining doesn't have to mean that the economy won't continue to grow and it doesn't mean their personal fortunes won't grow. 

right now, workers are paid as little as possible with many companies moving to part-time and contract workers to avoid paying benefits entirely. through the pandemic, we've seen many people argue that the economy needs to come first. people don't matter to their employers and millions in canada live [on the brink of insolvency](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/half-of-canadians-within-200-of-not-being-able-to-cover-bills-debt-payments-survey-1.5379871) while a number of ceos saw their fortunes reach new highs. 

i'd argue that the current economic growth isn't actually benefitting most people. 

[gravity payments](https://people.com/human-interest/ceo-dan-price-says-companys-revenue-has-tripled-since-he-gave-employees-70000-minimum-salary/) out of the us has an interesting story that companies should pay more attention to.

from the article: 
&gt; \"six years later and our revenue has tripled. more importantly, our staff and company are thriving in various ways,\" price tells people. \"[we have a] 10-time increase in new homes bought and babies born. employees have increased savings and paid down debts.\" 

this goes back to something henry ford said (though he had some terrible personal views, i think he was right on this): 
&gt;no one loses anything by raising wages as soon as he is able. it has always paid us. low wages are the most costly any employer can pay. it is like using low-grade material--the waste makes it very expensive in the end. there is no economy in cheap labor or cheap material. the hardest thing i ever had to do was to reduce wages. i think we were the last big company to come to it. now i am mighty glad that wages are climbing again.

[here](https://www.npr.org/2014/01/27/267145552/the-middle-class-took-off-100-years-ago-thanks-to-henry-ford#:~:text=in%20january%201914%2c%20henry%20ford,economy%20driven%20by%20consumer%20demand.) is an interesting article if you'd like to look into the topic further.

right-wing media, and i’m not talking about your centre-right newspaper like the sun or the national post although they have their own problems. i’m talking about groups like ontario/canada proud, the millennial post and rebel media. they’re pouring fuel onto these rabid conspiracy theorists. trumpism was born of the same way through the normalization of fox news and the likes south of the border. thankfully here it’s not as widespread but we’re only a few years behind america with social media.

we have these organizations attacking politicians directly and riling up these dangerous groups of people. we’ve already seen people try to go after trudeau. not to mention all the covid anti-lockdown bs which is directly connected to this movement. look at that bbq restaurant in toronto - the owner was able to fundraise on him standing up to the government. this is all a grifting organization to milk money out of the alt-right. but in the process of profiting they’re playing with fire because these people are very dangerous. it feeds off the low educated and sometimes the mentally ill and these aren’t the people we want to be militarizing.

it isn’t going to end well if we can’t deal with the rampant misinformation and conspiracy theories on social media and within these echo chambers. it’s a tricky subject with free speech but i think it could be argued that this speech is malicious and meant to incite violence. the same people who stormed the us capital do exist here and dark forces are trying to incite and organize them. we need to pay attention.",liberals

firstly, i don't think that it represents all that is great about canada. as a westerner it doesn't speak to me. so either in your view we're not including the west in what makes canada great or your assertion is overstated.

second of all, i think canada vastly punches under its weight in the world and everyone apart from canadians seem to recognize that. china pushes us around and our allies exclude us. i don't care if canada has great brand power in botswana that sure didn't land prime minister \"canada's back\" trudeau a council seat. the fact that we're under threat to be booted from the 5-eyes, we were left out of the recent nuclear sub deal at a time when we're about to be left hanging in the arctic because our current fleet is too decrepit. heck the us even has to scold us into ponying up 200 peace keepers. that paints a very different picture of a \" most successful and respected country.\"

internally we're even worse. our inflation is sky high, we're in debt up to our ears and we're trying to shut down the industry that's provided much of our wealth and productivity over the last few decades. it's a litany of self inflicted wounds for the most part and continuing mismanagement is starting to fray our national unity.

don't take this personally, but your attitude is what i hate about canada. it's one thing to have a sense of patriotic pride, it's entirely another to self proclaim our vast superiority when it isn't remotely true. and to me the maple leaf flag is emblematic of that inflated degree of self regard. cool is the last thing a country should be, especially when it's evidently skin deep.",liberals

instead, why not ask the question? what led someone to a state of mind where they could do something like this and how can we prevent it? the simple fact is that there are lots of ways for mad men to hurt a lot of people, many that are more effective and less regulated than firearms. 

there are several components used to make explosives being sold in canadian tire and home depot without any kind of registration or control, yet we don't have people blowing others up all the time. 

the non-gang related firearms incidents primarily come from a tiny segment of the population who do not have adequate access to mental health services, who also have access to a firearm. 

this is where we should focus our efforts if we want to genuinely prevent tragedies like what happened in 1989, and again in 2020. 

to do this we need mental health and government systems that are trusted by canadian gun owners. gun owners need to feel safe to come forward to say \"i own a gun and i need mental help\", and they need to have a system that's ready to provide them with competent help when they ask for it. currently we have neither.",conservatives

&gt;replacing personal car usage with transit usage is good.

sure.  as far as the statement goes, which has nothing to do with our federal windfall. does it?

if you mean to say said funding bonanza will \"replace personal car usage\", i will remind you that such a claim can not be assumed, not at all.  there are dozens of ways the net effect of 'b' could, and probably  will have the opposite effect.  but more to the point, neither policy is meant to change consumption *patterns*, and arguing over the net result of 'a' versus 'b' will miss the point.

i have actually taken close a look at the vancouver broadway corridor project, a very likely recipient of these monies, and my take is that it is clearly a social disaster precipitating massive destruction and displacement.  it does not or will not change \"personal car usage\" in any  environmentally positive way.  but the claim that it will, will certainly be abused in it's service.  repeatedly.

smaller parties, or grassroots upstart parties, that offer much more compelling ideas are shut out of the political scene simply because of the electoral system. eliminating fptp would encourage more political competition to offer better ideas.

now that's all in theory, how about in practice? the graphic on [page 12 of this report](https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/democracyreport2020.pdf) shows that the 3 major fptp countries are generally less satisfied with democracy, and over the last 25 years, their satisfaction has decreased further (canada included). on the other hand, countries with some sort of proportional system occupy the top spots, and the satisfaction these countries have with democracy has also increased over the last 25 years. this batch of countries can also be found in the top spots of the [corruption index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index), ranked above canada.",liberals

its the least government regulation as possible compared to every other solution to climate change. it sets a target, with a externality price. and letsbthe market figure out how to actually meet that target.

this proves that quebec nationalists were basing their opinions on this subject on irrational, islamic fears rather than any real concern for safety. this forced the ignorant p\\[eople at the quebec soccer federatin adn jean charest to back down from their ignorant.

it also shows how effective international pressure on quebec nationalists in protecting the rights of minorities in quebec. it's sad that an international orfanization like fifa has to protect qeuebc minorities against prejudice as opposed to their governments. it shows how sick these power-mad minds are in quebec when they abuse their authority and take out their prejudices on 9-year-old girls.  it shows how misplaced they are in putting public scrutiny on muslim school teachers wearing a hijab as opposed to high placed nationalists throwing muslim children off the soccer field because they don;t like the look of their head covering. who here is the real threat to our children and quebec society here?",liberals

nah. your logic was the same as my logic going into the 2019 election. i thought both st. john's seats would see a major cpc bounce-back from the abysmally low numbers seen during the abc days of stephen harper. i didn't predict that they would win either seat, but i thought that sje would be a pretty decent 3-way race. this was fueled also by regional polling numbers showing the cpc having gained major support in eastern nl.

come election day the cpc support in st. john's was nowhere near competitive for the cpc. times have changed, the cpc stronghold days are likely long gone as demographics have shifted in the city. poll-by-poll results after the fact showed the cpc winning a lot of the polls in the more rural suburbs of st. john's (pouch cove, flatrock, etc.) but that was nowhere near good enough to offset the overwhelming defeat inside the parts of the district where people actually live. in fact, the cpc didn't win a single poll south of torbay.

even if we look at the provincial election results, the suburbs which consist of cape st. francis is still a tory stronghold, but the population there isn't enough to swing the federal results. even the provincial pc party is in trouble in urban st. john's; you could argue that they haven't had great success there since the 2007 election. once again, a changing demographic.

ultimately, the polling results showing the resurrection of the cpc party in nl leading up to the 2019 election were, for the most part, correct. except the support has shifted about 200 km west of where it used to be. the cpc need to give up on the pipe dream of winning back st. john's east and focus on where they can realistically win a district: bonavista-burin-trinity, or possibly coast of bays-central-notre dame.

edit: also, here's my cpc hot take regarding nl. they don't care if they win a seat here ever again since 1-2 seats won't likely change any outcome for any election. but they need to look like they're trying. st. john's east is the district that the st. john's airport is in. they fly in, drive about 5 minutes away, give a presser, and drive back to the airport. in fact, pretty sure last election andrew scheer knocked on a few doors in the neighbourhood literally across the street from the airport before flying off to somewhere they cared about. i don't think they actually think they can win sje, but it's the district that requires the least amount of work while also looking like they're trying.",conservatives

it's to establish pseudo-nationalism in an era where francophone boomers feel encroached upon when they're not.  and to establish cheaply-garnered votes for easily-done and agreed-upon policy relating to the public sector, solving a problem that - like you say - doesn't even exist.

the whole point of the current conservative position is that invoking s. 33 is an entirely fair and ordinary part of our democratic due process. perhaps they wish to follow through on jason kenney's old dream of using the clause to eliminate gay rights after that old, bitter loss of his party in *vriend v. alberta*, in which alberta was forced by s.15 (which can be ignored using s.33) to allow lgbtq+ basic human rights protections.

personally, as an ontarian i'd prefer to see ontario adopt a provincial constitution that reinforces charter protections by requiring a super-majority to invoke s.33, with confirming referenda after five years, ensuring it would only be used in actual emergencies. 

but if that is not on offer, there is nothing at all uncivil in using what the conservatives assure us with the utmost civility and sincerity is a simple, ordinary legislative tool to pursue our own agenda - and i see no reason to be apologetic or wilting about that agenda. 

my point is that this is a two-edged sword. conservatives lack the imagination to understand this, and will likely need to be shown - always, of course, respecting due process.",conservatives

what we unfortunately have here is one party that belittles us culturally &amp; economically, and pushes unwanted western grievance politics + social conservatism on us (cpc). another party that belittles us by not paying attention to our issues or bothering to show up (ndp). 

and most recently, a party that was attentive and present under the former leader and responded to a third party need (in pei and nb), until the new leadership shat on all that progress, transformed said party into a toronto-focused atlantic-blind show, and enabled their lone mp to defect (greens). 

so the default option for atlantic canada remains the liberal party of canada. personally i'm leaning on spoiling my ballot next election, as i dislike them all. but i have no doubt that most of my fellow atlantic citizens will vote liberal.",liberals

recent immigrants tend to be poor, living in rough neighbourhoods, and working low-paying jobs to get by. you can imagine why this group tends not to vote conservative. but even many established, middle-class immigrants have loyalty to centre-left views, because they once went through that struggle phase and had to rely on the social safety net. not just that, they often come from countries with extreme poverty and no social safety net, so they see the welfare state in a more favourable light, regardless of whether they're currently benefiting from it or not.",liberals

gjmvqzk,2021-01-17T03:01:19.000-08:00,"listen up. here are the stakes. &gt;with all due respect (and i'm trying to read your post in good faith), 

thank you.

despite what may come across as fervency or dogmatism, i do actually believe in charity during a discussion. from my perspective, there are leftists with whom one can argue all in a sense of good faith, but it is becoming increasingly rare. not mainstream. leftists want *evil* conservatism destroyed, and charity ain't going to make that happen fast enough for them.

that is why you can only be so mild and meek—you have to assert yourself and your values at some point and grapple with an enemy who wants you annihilated.

&gt;i believe that the exchange of ideas, and reasoned debates, are one of the foundations of liberty and a healthy society.

but this is our first point of disagreement. i would not say reasoned debates are *foundational* to liberty or a healthy society. this is a classically liberal principle (more on that later). i would say that order and virtue are foundational for a society, and only then can an open and charitable discourse take place.

the left has degraded both to such an extent—and only plans to accelerate this degeneration—that free discourse is no longer fully possible, and even so, it is not profitable. you are not going to talk people out of voting for free money or into virtuous lives. you just aren't.

&gt;(you seem to be a catholic, or at least appreciate the catholic tradition, so i'd point out that st. thomas aquinas and the medieval scholastics valued this kind of thing)

my faith is somewhat in flux, but you are indeed correct that i respect the catholic tradition, as well as the eastern orthodox tradition. i am no aquinas expert, as i've only started reading *summa theologica*, but while i agree that he would be in favour of free and charitable debate, you have to appreciate the context. free and charitable debate in a culturally homogenous, highly ordered society is different than the \"no holds barred, anything goes\" classical liberalism as though one is \"outside\" of culture and society. 

aquinas wasn't looking to argue the merits of abandoning all decency and marching down the streets of paris wearing no clothes and with the words \"gay pride\" and \"hail satan\" written on one's chest.

even the american founding fathers, certainly liberals in the classical sense, recognized that the society they were creating had a certain wasp (for lack of a better term, though \"white\" is obviously an anachronism in this context) ethic and culture in which all of this liberty was to exist. they would not likely appreciate where culture has ended up. but that's the problem. despite one's best intentions, liberalism leads to dissolution.

&gt;now you - and anton - seem to believe that western civilization, or everyone good about it, is under an *existential threat* from liberals and/or leftists who want to destroy it. this is a *very serious, inflammatory charge*, and it's the kind of thing that can lead to open conflict and break down the bonds between people in society (and you and i seem to agree that that's not a good thing). to make sure i'm not misunderstanding you:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. what do you see as essential to western civilization or a healthy society?  
&gt;  
&gt;2. how do you define \"left\" or \"liberal\", and what is the essential difference that distinguishes them from \"right\" or \"conservative\"? what are examples of \"right-wing values\"?  
&gt;  
&gt;3. in what ways do you think the \"left\" or \"liberals\" are causing the downfall of western civilization? do you believe that they're doing it intentionally because they believe western civilization or right-wing values are bad, or are they well-intentioned but unintentionally causing the decline of western civilization?

\\#1. i already mentioned this, but order and virtue, in a classical sense. that means a hierarchy where everyone knows their place, and where they aim to live a good life and fulfill their role in society to the best of their ability.

\\#2. by \"liberalism\" i am referring to the enlightenment belief system that prioritizes liberty and equality over anything else or any sort of beliefs or doctrines that may have different origins but end with the same result.

this enlightenment conception of liberty basically means being able to do whatever you want so long as you don't impinge on anyone else's freedom to do whatever they want. this sounds nice, but i don't think it is sustainable or conducive to virtue. i prefer liberty or freedom in a more aristotelean sense, where one is free when one is not enslaved to one's passions, regardless of whether or not society technically allows one to do *anything at all* or not.

leftism includes liberalism in my view, but it is more generalized to include all belief systems that assume man is formless clay that can be molded into a tool for utopian achievement. so while marxism is not strictly liberal in the sense that it does not advocate total freedom (one is not free to own capital, for example), but it is leftist insofar as it denies certain realities about human nature and life on earth more generally.

right-wing values facilitate an ordered and virtuous society. they are in touch with human nature, and understand that virtue is a holistic characterization of one's life in terms of one's actions, relationships, and roles. they respect liberty but only insofar as it is compatible with order and virtue. the right-wing view of man is as a steward who has been given great gifts by past generations and must multiply them and pass them forward to the next generations. a right-winger must live as harmoniously with nature as is reasonably compatible with civilization and stewarding its gifts. a right-winger is not necessarily militaristic or war-mongering (but also not necessarily not), but he must be strong and willing to defend what he has inherited with all his strength. a right-winger is a good neighbour and a friend to his community. i could go on, but i think you get the idea. a right-winger is not someone who gets to do whatever he wants without consequences and who encourages others to do the same without judgment.

\\#3. leftism is generally corrosive to society because it operates on principles that are disconnected from reality, and therefore tricks people into structures, arrangements and actions that actually undermine society in the long run. liberalism, in particular, is corrosive in that it smashes natural human bonds and roles in a way that eventually makes an ordered, virtuous society impossible. all that is left in the individual and a maximally powerful state. the state must be maximally powerful in order to enforce the ever-expanding list of rights and freedoms, and because a society of atomized individuals is hard to control and ensure cohesion.

your last question is very hard to answer, and may even be a bit muddled, but i will try and answer it as best as i can. are leftists intentionally trying to destroy western civilization? well, yes, but not out of malicious nihilism (usually), but only so they can build a new, \"better\" one.

to the extent that right-wing values are opposed to their project (i.e., totally), yes, they do think right-wing values are bad and evil. right-wingers basically want the opposite of progress and emancipation, in their view, which is actually more or less true, if you define those words how they do.

i think the issue here is that you don't understand at least two things:

1. that some products (including food) are more carbon intensive than others.
2. low income people generally see money in their pocket from canada's carbon tax scheme
3. the goal of carbon taxes on food (and everything else really) is not exactly to get people to consume less; it is to get people to consume less carbon intensive products.

as carbon prices go up, super carbon intensive foods like beef will increase in price more dramatically than others. eventually, people will be priced out of beef if the magic seaweed doesn't work out (sorry beef lovers) and those that don't eat beef will actually see money in their pockets from this tax scheme.

second, is it?

maybe you can share some data but my intuition is that people would, for example, eat much less beef if the true cost was attached to it and eat more beans and greens if they remained relatively cheap.

hddteoe,2021-09-18T07:45:52.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected i think that analysis is a bit disingenuous. the analysis quoted references [this breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m25mnhakvj_3kxlx3_jbk7jd5m5gl4wzahcsw3lsuxm/edit#gid=0) of the witness statements. there is: stv, mmp, av, list pr, fptp, rural-urban pr, other, pr any option.

the analysis av and fptp as against pr. however, i would argue that stv is a form or ranked ballot. i also don't think all the other systems can simply be lumped into pro-pr. here is how i see the breakdown.

* fptp - 8.8%
* ranked ballot
   * stv - 17.6% 
   * av - 4.0%
* proportional representation
   * mmp - 37.6%
   * list pr - 2.4%
   * rural-urban pr - 4.0%
   * pr - any option - 16.8% 
* other - 16.8%

granted with the pr - any option, this does give mmp a 54.4% support.",liberals

with stv, you get to rank all the candidates, and go across party lines to get the best representation possible.  it's also very friendly to a strong independent candidate.  mmp is a step in the wrong direction, because it creates the ability for the party to hand out seats in parliament to party hacks &amp; bagmen.  if you play ball, and be a good little party member, you can be given a safe seat by being placed high on the party list.  mmp proponents will point out that \"you don't have to use party lists\", except that because er will happen through political parties, it's almost inevitable that party lists are what will get used.  mmp using a ranked ballot for the local election, and near winner selections for top up mp's i'd be perfectly happy with.

obviously i'd happily take any form of mmp over fptp, but i'm also extremely wary of giving a bunch of party seats to fringe parties that are unable to win any regular seats.  if there were a limitation that you can no more than double your regional number of seats, that prevents truly fringe parties from having what can act like a kingmaker influence &amp; get concessions they should not be able to get based on their support levels.",liberals

yes, this is how we do it now - we essentially run 338 independent elections, where each election is limited to selecting 1 representative.

we could just as well run 169 elections where each district selects 2 representatives.  or 60 elections of 5 representatives each together with 19 elections of 2 representatives each.  or, at the other extreme, we could just run 1 giant election which selects all 338 representatives together.  or, some combination of those.

each of the options has certain benefits and certain weaknesses.  the current system has the benefit of being extremely simple to run, simple to understand and gives a very direct relationship between voter and representative.  however, there are disadvantages.

the important thing here is that the use of our current system, is a choice.  there is no fundamental reason that we have to stick with the current system which puts a premium on local communities over larger groupings.

personally, i will support a move to pretty much any other electoral system over fptp.",liberals

i guess people thought you could just slap on the tax and the rest will sort itself out with some minor price adjustments. no: if this thing is going to work your steak is going to shoot up in price much faster than your bag of lentils, and likewise with housing and everything else that requires steel. if we need it, we pay the higher price and cut something else, or we find an alternative. we have to incontivize those kinds of switches.",liberals

i feel this. it took jagmeet 2 years after becoming leader of the ndp to come to new brunswick, he stopped in to promote like 1 person who was running and never came back. meanwhile trudeau stopped in my small town, talk about government funding for our nature park. also, the liberal candidate showed up at my door twice trying to get my vote, while we never even got a flyer for the ndp candidate. if it wasn't for the fact i keep up to date on these things, we would've never known who was running.",liberals

gytdgjc,2021-05-19T22:40:22.000-07:00,"quebec can modify part of the canadian constitution unilaterally, trudeau says you can't create a new office holder who signs bills into law, is able to dissolve parliament, or grants pardons. any such change would affect the offices of the queen, the governor general, and the lieutenant governors of the provinces, which explicitly requires amending the constitution via the unanimous consent procedure in section 41. if you're using section 41, then there's nothing preventing you from abolishing the monarchy in canada, so there wouldn't be much point in creating this situation.

french is already recognized as the official language of quebec. inserting this kind of language into the constitution (the official language declaration, but especially the nationhood declaration) is generally done for the purpose of informing how other provisions are interpreted. if quebec makes this change in this way, these provisions would have to be interpretively null, but directly inserting them into the constitution act, 1867 is clearly intended to give them an appearance of authority. doing this will mean these provisions will always have to be held to one side and understood as not having the impact they might appear to have because of how they were enacted.",liberals

i side with palestine, but until hamas doesn’t have a hold on gaza, governments will be hesitant to side with palestine due to their status as a terrorist group. 

i’m just stating the obvious here. again, i tend to side with palestine in this conflict, but the presence of hamas is makes it difficult for many governments around the world.",liberals
