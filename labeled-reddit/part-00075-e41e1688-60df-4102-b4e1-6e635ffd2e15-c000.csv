now, having met trudeau on many occasions before he became leader and obviously less approachable, the man is an idiot. he was coddled since birth and even his stints as an elementary school substitute were soft placements. he essentially didn't hold serious long-term employment until becoming an mp off name and solid campaign teams. i say all this because he does absolutely nothing.

now for his administration, theresa tam has contradicted herself a number of times and lockdown measures all over the place. flooded grocery stores are still baffling to me. nevermind delayed international restrictions. then you get the quarantine hotels. not since ww2 has there been such weak minded freedom violating policy. an objective panel recommended dropping it and instead the liberal response was to double fines.

now i know the hotel quarantines affect a small percentage of the population but it is amazingly clear how inept and criminal that is. then having vaccinated only priveleges. every other country doing vaccine passports allows for pcr alternatives or antibody. not the liberals though.

getting off track here perhaps but as a neutral voter i would consider literally any other party before the liberals and us embarrassing ourselves with a dunce figure head. yeah, yeah i know trump. but honestly at trudeau's age, trump was certainly smarter. i'm not talking about good people here, just intelligence.

my best example is forgiving student debt, first the federal government only owns a small part of it, and of that our debt for student loans is nowhere near an issue like the us. this was pandering to the worst level which made no sense.

the second was the water situation on reserve. the liberals lifted over 100 boil water advisories, and he said that they should have finished them all, and that money should be no object... the fact that he thinks money was the restriction here, and not the million of other key factors on building such complicated infrastructure across over 100 communities in the span of 5 years is just disappointing.

on a more serious note its interesting looking at whose vote share is going to who (speculative). 


it seems the ndp and pa are fighting over the same vote share confirming in my mind their status as the protest votes of choice. the difference being that the pa have two relatively safe seats and the ndp have...well, they have a hard time keeping a leader, let alone a seat. so in an election with these numbers do you see the ndp get 11% and no seat or does their vote collapse into the pa since they have a shot at winning something (as i suspect happened last election).


the greens seem to be winning over both liberal and tory voters (before challenging that last point do recall that in the federal election the fredericton vote share went from green to conservative). there is a very real risk of them taking out the liberals as the liberals have been confined to the francophone ridings while the greens have more widespread support.


the aforementioned strong francophone support for the liberals was mentioned in the poll data and i think this points to a bit of 'alberta syndrome' where the raw numbers hide the reality that the greens may be ahead of the liberals in the rest of the province. it is an interesting dynamic which may result in two separate races with pc-lib in the francophone ridings and pc-green in the rest of nb.

i agree. i think a change they could make is toning down the negative ad campaigns and replace them with policy-centred discussions (\"we're the only party that supports ...\").

&gt;the liberals faced a pile on of attacks from the opposition, and a generally negative portrayal of the campaign from the media.

the tone from the media was quite negative at the beginning of the campaign, but became much more favourable as the campaign progressed. on the other hand, the media has always demonized the ndp.

&gt;in 50+ years of existence they’ve never formed government, and only formed opposition once in a fluke election unlikely to be repeated, and the results of which were nowhere close to sustained in the subsequent one.

to be fair, they couldn't even pretend to be a contender to government for most of that 50 years (much like today's green party). in any case, this arrangement is commonplace in first-past-the-post systems. just look at the lib dems in the uk: they haven't had any success either. this is really because fptp limits much discourse into a two-party system, where people never even consider voting for a third party. so i would say it's also a problem of systemic disadvantage (not that there is nothing the leadership can do better, but it's not the whole story).",liberals

the build back better act is constantly changing, but from a few weeks ago the [ev rebate had caps](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/19/ev-tax-credits-in-bidens-build-back-better-act-will-help-sell-more-cars-than-new-chargers.html):  


&gt;under the bill, individual taxpayers reporting adjusted gross incomes of $250,000 or $500,000 for joint filers to get the new ev tax credit. it also would limit the ev credit to cars priced at no more than $55,000 and trucks and suvs up to $80,000.

personally, i think that cap is way too high and the income level is also way too high. in canada, the base vehicle needs to be $45,000 canadian with upgraded features to $55,000 canadian. $55,000 us is around $70,000 or so with current exchange rate and too high in my opinion.

that said, there continues to be supply issues in canada &amp; the us with people waiting months to get a new ev. we should make raises our emission standards with heavy fines like europe has done which has resulted in quite the spike in ev sales in the last year or so. car companies will increase the supply if it means the alternative is millions if not billions of fines.",liberals

so a consumer looking at a ~$80k ev, would really be in a much lower price category for a gas car in terms of ownership. applying that to a lower priced tesla model 3 works the same way. ~$40-50k model 3 vs. ~$30-40k gas car or even less.

re: your second point, not going to look up a paywalled article, but the basic math is as follows to simply compare your gas car cost to an ev car cost.

gas car cost: monthly payment + monthly gas spend + monthly maintenance spend (divide your approximate annual spend by 12) + insurance cost.

ev cost: monthly payment quote + ~10% of your monthly gas spend + no monthly/annual maintenance spend + insurance quote

that's the math. if you want to figure out what your actual kwh electricity costs are i can provide math for that too, but a conservative rule of thumb is about 10% of your monthly gas spend.",liberals

boomers are not selling their homes in metro cores. they are preventing any low cost or higher density projects. dragging them out for years and decades at a time. they sit on all the prime real estate. as well they supported policies which keep rates low which drives asset inflation. even the changes to help seniors be able to keep up their lifestyle (everything that keeps inflation low) comes at the expense of younger people not getting raises.

and the urbanization of everyone in the world is driving a lot more peoples to the major cities than just immigration. the cities need to respond by building but they aren't building enough because boomers stop all development that they don't believed increases their property value. the system that consults neighbors as stake holders need to be removed and property taxes need to be jacked up on single detached within metro cores.

the ndp are usually attacked as elitist and ideological, but also often as \"well meaning fools\", gullible and overzealous. (fwiw, i disagree with this, and don't see the ndp as any more prone to flights of fancy than any other party). while some people may dislike them for the first two things, they are far harder to attack as corrupt in areas where they have not recently been in government. their image as principled, zealous outsiders means that a lot of people trust that the ndp's intentions are pure. however, this will not necessarily translate to support, as that perceived purity of intention is actually held against the ndp - the old \"bleeding heart\" trope. many on the right, fairly or not, believe that the ndp will try to solve every single social problem with expensive, experimental social programs that will bleed taxpayers dry. this makes the ndp simultaneously easy to like and easy to oppose for people on the right wing of the spectrum.",liberals

h29d8m1,2021-06-18T08:06:50.000-07:00,"is it hypocritical for the liberals to put the brakes on coal but not on natural gas? fuel cells make li-ion batteries seem cheap. lithium isn't the only chemistry that can be used, just the currently most cost effective for its energy density. 

energy efficiency is very important. it's not like the old days when you could just throw up a new thermal plant whenever needed. for every 100mw generated, we should use as much of that as possible for actual work. getting 70mw worth of travel is a huge advantage over getting 30mw of travel out of it. 

ammonia and hydrogen as a fuel are hugely problematic. hydrogen needs to be stored at 10kpsi. it causes hydrogen embrittlement. it needs to be vented from storage/fuel tanks in order to avoid overpressurization, which all contribute to the poor energy efficiency. and all of the required infrastructure simply doesn't exist, whereas huge strides have been made in ramping up bev charging stations.

toyota, when commenting on their hydrogen powered yaris gr racecar, said that while the engine was based on an existing one, it basically needed to be completely modified to work at all, and a lot more time to get it to work decently. retrofitting an existing engine just won't be viable for a neighbourhood mechanic, unlike conversion to natural gas or propane. i'm unsure where ammonia would stand, but i doubt the feds would be too keen on approving the use of ammonia as a transportation fuel.

moreover, there is no way to determine who the real leadership is unless the fns have autonomy. whilst under canada's control, the best tool we have is a vote, democracy, the bands system. but democracy and the band is rejected by a large fraction of fns in favor of traditional systems .... but all those traditional systems are different and may again, not have clear leadership, nor are the powers of traditional leaders clear since they are so varied. generally the way leadership is determined within a sovereign nation is the person that is able to control the government and military. but these states have no military and have multiple weak governments. the result is that the only leadership is what canada decides is the leadership.

if canada decides the leadership, they clearly are not autonomous, or sovereign.

-----

look at the wetsuweten conflict. a gas company wanted to run a line, and contacted the elected representatives of bands for consent. but then the tribal chiefs of some of the 13 houses of the 5 clans rejected this. there is a group that calls themselves \"the wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs\" which has 6 of those chiefs today (covering the 6 clans but not all 13 houses), although it used to be more. all men (aka dinize). the women (aka tsakeze) got removed from the leadership by the men after the conflict began, but the female chiefs still claim authority. moreover, the system isn't just 'this person is the leader and can make all decisions', traditionally, the women had significant veto powers. and authority actually is further broken down by topic, much like our federal government controls the border and our provincial one controls health care.

is \"wetsuweten\" even a legitimate group to negotiate with? should we be looking to negotiate with each house instead? each clan? each band? what about talking to the carrier sekani tribal council (representing 8 fns)? if we're were talking about treaty agreements, should we be talking to the tribes that signed them? what if they don't exist? who determines this? if canada gets to pick, then surely they can control outcomes since they have so many potential options.... but i hardly see a way for anything else to happen.

during the conflict, trudeau met with an even smaller subset (something like 3 of the men) at that time, but was that fair? who should canada negotiate with? we have no legal experts on wet'suwet'en law that could make any sense of the hereditary system to determine a rightful king. and this is one group of hundreds.

i read it the same way. that is not a logical fallacy. 

let me go through it again. the fallacy is if you attempt to claim a fact is true by offering the logical proof that it's a common position or that it's popular. in other words - it's literally saying 2+2=6 because everyone wants it to or everyone thinks it does, so it does. in other words, your \"source\" for the fact is it's popularity. that isn't a valid source. 

what he said is that a political party opposing the will of the people by going against a popular decision is political suicide. that is in fact a very logical statement. popularity directly affects how people will vote. you can argue if you think it's not suicide for a political party, which relies on the vote of the people, to anger the people by doing something unpopular, but you cannot argue that it's a logical fallacy. 

you have misunderstood the meaning of the term entirely. and what a logical argument is. the term does not refer to just anything that has something to do with public opinon. it has to do with using public opinion as a source for a completely unrelated fact. public opinon is not unrelated to politics. is it. 

as to your second comment - did you stop reading at 'no\" or something? i gave a detailed answer as to why you were wrong an that definition doesn't apply to what you said! i didn't ignore it in the slightest!

if you’ve supported the party in the past or thought about doing so, and you are troubled by this, please continue to support the greens both federally and provincially. 

1. the greens are grassroots. they are not defined by what the leader says/do or what an executive member or staff may say/do. they are defined by the policies that all members can decide upon and bring forward. 

2. the greens are still out best and only option to tackle climate change. neither the liberals or the ndp have plans that are bold enough, and we’re already seeing the consequences of weak actions and greenwashing: heat dome, fires, floods…

3. if you can’t get behind the leader or the party  because of all the drama… please support the local candidates and provincial parties. they have nothing to do with this mess. 

4. don’t believe everything you read or say. the drama unfolding is filled with complex issues, some are about racism, some about good/bad management, some about ego, some about people being stubborn, and some about people being opportunistic. add covid to the mix, the israel/palestinian conflict and a likely early election and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. unfortunately, some members are very stubborn and emotional on some issues, and the media is just having a feast. 

on a personal note:

and thank you for yours. it's not easy being a ppc supporter on this sub, i imagine. the least i can do is respond in good faith. 

&gt; getting into the leader's debate is more than nice, it's essential to being considered legitimate and for the ppc is the only opportunity they have to get to speak to the nation.

this is true, which is why it will be important for bernier to hit the requisite numbers if he wants to find his way back to parliament. at the end of the day though, that will be the test that matters. 

sloan is dangerous for bernier if he starts stealing antivaxx or other conspiracy theorist support in english speaking canada. i apologize if that sounds pejorative, but the truth is that for \"fringe\" parties like the ppc, the party formerly known as derek and the gpc, conspiracy theorists and extremists will always be a disproportionate part of the grassroots. gpc had anti-wifi people. canada has a sizeable contingent of qanon supporters, anti-vaxxers and other related conspiracy theorists who are looking for a home. bernier has been trying to appeal to them. not being able to recruit sloan could pose a problem for him, as sloan is far better in english and is the man of the hour in the average voter's goldfish like memory - which has to be tough, given that bernier's really been putting in a lot of effort to connect and consolidate voters dissatisfied with cpc moderation. 

i think you're right, though, to point out that other parties have risen from zero to hero unexpectedly, and it would be wrong to count out the ppc. your reasoning about the potential signature issues is quite good, and may be the spring board bernier needs. 

&gt; picking red torys isn't working.

fwiw, the conservative have not had a red tory in charge since arguably mackay. o'toole and scheer are old school blue tories which, granted, is different from reform/bernier style populists that some on the right crave.  it's also worth remembering that the cpc's last foray into populist identity politics ended in a flaming wreck in 2015, and there is good reason why many are wary of returning to that strategy. of course, after every loss every faction will blame the others for their loss. if o'toole loses, for example, expect competing op-eds decrying \"caving to social conservative spoilers\" and \"a lack of conservative conviction\" and heaven only knows who's actually right. given the current polls showing collapsing alberta support and ontario's chilly reception, possibly both.",conservatives

i would vote liberal if an election were held right now, in part because i don't like the alternatives, and the lpc is my default choice just in terms of my political values. the liberals haven't given me enough of a reason to not vote for them.

i'm not gonna act like trudeau or his government have been perfect, they haven't. they've made their share of mistakes. but overall, i think over the last six years we've had pretty good governance in this country. we're making serious moves on childcare, we ended the archaic and unnecessary criminalization of marijuana, we took in thousands of people fleeing war while weathering the rise of extremist politics much, much better than most of our western counterparts have. we brought in a revenue neutral carbon tax, and made other moves on climate action like marine protection. i had my issues with how the liberals handled the books before the pandemic, as the \"our debt to gdp rate is low\" argument fell apart when an external factor like covid screwed everything up. something like this was always a possibility and i think they were a bit reckless pre-pandemic. but since the pandemic, i think the liberals' willingness to spend big has been beneficial. we had some hiccups with vaccine procurement, but they straightened it out and we're inching closer to beating covid.

in all, i'm happy with the way things are going. i think the liberals better reflect my own values than the other parties, and they've been pretty good on the policy front as far as i'm concerned.

i live in one of the safest liberal ridings in canada, the chances of another party winning ottawa south is basically nil so there's no real argument for strategic voting here, wherever you land on the political spectrum. either way, i don't see any other party convincing me to vote for them instead, and i'm content with the liberals, so that's how i'll vote",liberals

the job of the gg in being non partisan is actually to not be the pm's lap dog. for example when harper asked the gg to prorogue parliament so he could play politics dirty the gg said yes. the ethical and responsible decision for the gg would actually have been to refuse the request.

signage isn't something i'd point to as a big money funnel though. people can often afford that kind of thing without major issue as a one off. especially groups of people who pool cash on facebook. the value proposition though is that they'd use this sign or flag multiple times, which means they're anticipating multiple events, which means someone is organizing multiple events.

so that's a bit different than simply buying and flipping with no work done (although maybe he did that too, i don't know).

and from the numbers, they averaged only 2 per year, with 8 years where it was 3 per year. if the family business is to buy a house, renovate it and sell, that's very reasonable.

and article also says they held 12 of them for more than 2 years.

anyway, it was all within the law. and the liberal party's policy proposal will help prevent simple flipping.

i’ll give you an example from one hospital i know. 

most emergency room visits should be in walk in clinics. therefore it would make sense for a walk in clinic to be adjacent to an er and triage would redirect. 

the er doctors are incorporated as a group. they provide their services from the inc to the hospital and in return manage their own support staff, schedules, overhead, vacation, sick leave, benefits, etc. they bill ohip and pay the hospital something like rent. they want more billables; though they also love complaining people come in to the er instead of walk in clinics. i truly lose my mind listening to them. 

the hospital is a non profit. however er is more lucrative than walk in clinic visits.

i don’t believe it is legal for hospitals to be private in ontario by the way. but they are separate entities from the province, privately managed. even though their funding model includes massive subsidies from the ministry of health with plenty of strings.

doctors are also private but the province attempted to claw back payments using their monopsony power, which is impossible if doctors were truly independent contractors. and yet doctors aren’t allowed to collective bargain. 

obviously if the patient was the buyer and capable of rational spending, they would buy health care services that were efficient, effective and quality. however no one is capable of rational spending for their own health care.

so given this legal and economic mess how would you get a walk in clinic next to that er and triage patients to the best and most affordable and most appropriate care model?",conservatives

1) you base your perception of 8,5m people only from your personal experience. don’t get me wrong, it’s really sad what you’ve been through, and it might not look like that, but yea i think that law 21 is useless. the thing is that you can’t assume the behaviour of an entire nation based on only one example. it’s like the lady at ctv that said quebec is a racist tribe against people from france because of a conversation with her hairdresser decades ago. i mean yea the guy had it rough and it’s sad, but i can assure you that many quebecers are friendly with french people, and not only from one pov.

2) you talk like québec voted for the caq only for bill 21. it’s like saying people voted for trudeau in 2015 only because of weed, and then saying that every single canadians are drug addicts. à nation rarely vote for a party because of one single thing, and in quebec context, many other factors were ingame. don’t forget that before the caq, the liberal party was in power with phillips couillard (you know, the guy that said a family of 4 could eat with 75$/week) and people were extremely sick of him and his ministers (especially barrette). and since the pq and qs weren’t at their bests, it was kinda expected that the caq win, but it’s not thanks to bill 21",liberals

look, i'm kind of centre/left politically, and whenever i heard right-wingers complaining about the cbc being biased i sort of wrote it off.  i read the news more than i watch it, listen to cbc radio occasionally and other than perhaps an overwhelming focus on issues that may not be of interest to right-wingers i didn't really see what they were talking about.  

then - election night, thought i'd actually put cbc on and watch their coverage of the results. barton was the moderator, and the amount of straight liberal spin that was coming from her was beyond belief imo.

like - i thought we all understood that the only reason for jt to call an election just two years in was to secure a majority.  and that anything short of that would be a failure.  that's the reality of the situation, right?  i thought that was something everyone understood.

i didn't hear that reflected in her commentary in any way- it was all about whether o'toole would face a leadership challenge or not.  when really - he's brand new, and he held the line basically, stopped jt from getting a true 'win' out of this.  i didn't vote for him and never would, but it's hard to see how you can call this a big enough loss for o'toole that his leadership would be in question.  jt on the other hand - called an election that wasn't necessary, and didn't get anything out of it - in that case it seems fair to raise questions.  

but that's not how rosemary barton saw it on election night, and considering that she was supposed to be in a neutral 'moderator' role, i found that a bit hard to take.",conservatives

but sure i’ll indulge you with anecdotal evidence 

the 2020 gun ban on “assault rifles” was celebrated on air. i never heard any analysis of the oic, simply posturing that it’s a good thing. gun control being a tenant of left leaning politicians. 

no one mentioned that “assault weapons” have been banned for decades. no one mentioned the already strict regime that gun owners abide by. no one mentioned the absurdly low rate of crime committed with legally owned firearms. no one dared even raise the notion that the firearms banned for being scary were functionally equivalent to other firearms that weren’t banned. 

basically a bunch of canadians had their sport sacrificed for something that was based in polling, not evidence. and no one raised these issues. 

we all agree that gun crime is bad. but no one explained why this measure would reduce gun crime. because the truth is: we already banned assault weapons. the “ar-15” you could buy at cabelas was tracked by the rcmp, pinned to 5 rounds, semi-automatic only. has more in common with grandpa’s hunting rifle than the real assault rifles we hand to everyday cops. but trudeau never made that distinction, because he knows his crowd dosent understand or know any of that. sporting rifles turned into the perfect political boogeyman.

&gt;fro feb 2018 - march 2019 there were 1788 non-resident purchases paying nrst

so unless you can explain how a 29% increase of foreign buyers did nothing to increase prices, that wasn't the cause.

edit:

also point of interest from the same article:

&gt;cbc's analysis suggests foreign buyers account for about 1.8 per cent of total home purchases in the gta (toronto plus the regions of york, peel, durham and halton) since the tax was imposed in april 2017. 

seems unlikely how 1.8% of transactions can stall a market.

frame the argument to prove that this person hung the flag on their private property with the intent and purpose of advocating genocide, or that there is willful ignorance at play. remove the land owner’s ability to say “that’s not why i displayed the flag.” because the burden of proof for their malicious act will be on the prosecution.

it’s not currently illegal to display or own, that should be changed - yes - but until that point, arguing that it is illegal is fruitless. use the energy to instead advocate for the law to be changed. write to your mp, other mps, write to trudeau. organize a petition and campaign. organize a fundraiser and lobby parliament. talk to news organizations or submit opinion pieces to your papers. make this a public concern. sway public opinion with your stance and refuse to back down. link displaying the flag to acts like cross burning. legislators are cowards? make them more afraid of not taking a stance. there are way too many reasons for them to remain silent because we aren’t holding them accountable. it’s our responsibility to show them that inaction and complacency is still picking a side. don’t say that we will never see it in court. spend the time and effort to ensure that it is brought to court and that our representatives can’t ignore stuff like this anymore. they can’t remain silent, we will hold their feet to the fire and force an acknowledgement.

the concept of personhood is a social construct and it is not a scientifically recognized term. anyone can have the personal belief to freely declare personhood at any stage they want. however we can all agree that one is definitely a person after they are born and that killing a baby would amount to murder. this is what the law currently reflects.

&gt;  
&gt;either taxes will need to rise, spending will need to decrease or perhaps some combination of both

while it's very true that canada will need to work to reduce its deficit through raising taxes/cutting spending in the future, i don't think anyone outside of hardcore mmt theorists think canada should (or would) seek to maintain the level of spending they have over the past year. i'm also not sure i agree that all current signs point to a hard recovery. the imf projects pretty substantial growth in 2021. i also think the boc will accept a higher level of inflation than we grew accustomed to over the last several years to ease some of the government debt burden. i would anticipate something closer to 2.5% and 3% than the 1.5%-2% inflation we've had more recently.

i do agree with you though that an election following the one anticipated this year will be about the post-pandemic economy. if the one this year results in a liberal majority, the liberals could have been in continuous power for a decade and all governments that have been in power for a prolonged period have been known to become complacent.",liberals

if anything, the most likely scenario is that the cpc manages to rip itself apart into a centrist party and a hard right party like from 1993 to 2004 and the liberals have 15-20 years of consecutive power until the right gets pissed off enough to merge again.",liberals

this would imply that with a different social construction people of different racial backgrounds could legitimately be considered non-persons.   in fact people have done this at various times and places.   the only way to avoid this and to definitively reject conceptions of a person that excludes some homo sapiens on the basis of sex, race, intelligence, or even creed is to defend a conception of personhood that is not merely a social construction.",conservatives

in the lead up to the campaign, the liberals continuously were explicitly clear about where they stood on the issue, while the ndp tried to straddle the fence and not take an actual position.

come the campaign, and while trudeau's position was already well-known and baked-in, mulcair's eventual coming out as also opposed to a ban on the niqab was

1. a surprise to some people who took the ndp vacuous position to mean they didn't oppose the ban;
2. a bigger deal to the media, since it was *news*, in the middle of the campaign.

i remain convinced that, had mulcair stated his opposition clearly right off the bat, it wouldn't have turned into a thing during the campaign. then again, the ndp campaign in 2015 consisted of trying to have different positions in different parts of the country and hope that nobody noticed the inconsistency, so i think this was more symptomatic of their systematic failings at the time than a one-off badly strategized issue.",liberals

you are right that the social construction on race has historically been used to discriminate against people of different backgrounds. just as the social construction of “personhood” is used to discriminate against women when it comes to abortion in some countries.",conservatives
