&gt;also, a new bill is more easily countered vs. a long established aspect.

new discrimination affecting people today is not more significant because of being recent. catholic school discrimination dwarfs bill-21 in the amount of people it has impacted. it's like co2 emissions. the current output rate is important, but the cumulative output since industrialization is what is changing the climate.

similarly, the current discrimination is important, but the cumulative discrimination of catholic schools and the cascading effects on people's (mostly visible minorities) livelihoods simply dwarfs it.

&gt;further, the quebec bill is farther reaching, applying to all provincial sectors, not just education.

again, cumulative vs. current rate. for instance, how many real public $'s have been denied from visible minorities and other non-catholics since the constitution sanctioned religious discrimination in hiring? how many in quebec since bill-21?

and why do we need these weapons?

 \"first, we're not a nuclear state.\"

currently canada doesn't possess nuclear weapons. in the past we did possess nuclear missiles and the wherewithal to use them. we could easily afford to rearm and maintain a nuclear arsenal of a maximum of 10 modern day nuclear missiles but, choose not to.

\"if you trust china's numbers they have 2 million active duty alone, and their reserves are 5 times our total military strength.\"

most of the pla's troops are conscripts. they induct some 1-2 million new conscripts every year and retain them as active duty for 2 years and then as active reserve for 1 year.

the chinese further pad the military numbers by requiring that all low and mid level bureaucrats, police, fire and emergency services personnel retain their active duty status in the people's liberation army.

that's a lot of people and most of them are dedicated pencil pushers and desk jockeys that aren't fit to fight and would down arms and run if there was an actual conflict.

by contrast russia has a professional military force. the quality of the troops they have still leaves much to be desired but they made great strides up until the early 2000's. since then corruption, nepotism and malfeasance has eroded the morale and effectiveness of the russian military.

i have to wonder why no one has questioned why vladimir putin's net worth is in the range of us$175-200 billion. how did he get to be so rich on an \"aparatchik's\" salary?

despite the efforts of russia's 1 percenters to loot the country and drive the russian population into abject poverty they still make good equipment. their navy, airforce and army has large stockpiles of tough, reliable and cheap weapons that can withstand, abuse, neglect, poor maintenance and the rigours of the environment and still be battle ready. 

i wish we could say the same for our military's equipment. most of our equipment has been designed by the united states and i would qualify it as pos. canada's f-18's can be knocked out of service by being in proximity to a lightning strike. they seize up and will not work in temperatures below -10ºc. they have serious issues with stalling out at low speeds and cannot do certain manoeuvres as it will overstress their airframes. their possible replacements, the f-35's, are much worse.",conservatives

it seems to me that immigration is one of the few knobs the government can turn that is:

1. unequivocally within federal jurisdiction, and therefore not captive to local nimbyism;

2. capable of being changed by fiat, directly and more-or-less immediately, not through some abstruse configuration of carrots and sticks and market voodoo; and

3. not a political third rail, like zoning reform or (other) demand-side solutions that people constantly tell me are unsaleable to the homeowning majority.

i mean, it seems pretty straightforward to me: if you want to reduce the price of something, you either need to increase supply or decrease demand—or both. i'm all for increasing supply, but my understanding is that we'd have to build hundreds of thousands of additional units just to meet demand as it stands today. so why are we bringing in more people, literally all of whom will need a product for which there is *already* a insufficient supply?",liberals
hixps4r,2021-11-01T07:52:20.000-07:00,"canada will put a cap on oil and gas sector growth, trudeau tells cop26 summit oh man, its almost like those individual consumption based emissions are actually pretty small potatoes eh? and that if heavy industry and horrifically polluting manufacturing industries were cleaned up a bit, there would be a huge impact. 

and in canada the same argument applies, but with nearly 40x the population (and way more industrial output, with fossil fuels dominated by coal in china and oil in canada) the relative and absolute improvements that china can make are way bigger. 

canada's climate does somewhat limit maximum improvements. the distances are vast, and the density is low and this means more energy.  our homes and businesses need heat and there really isn't a good way around that either. its not an excuse, its just a fact. canada will always consume more energy per capita than warmer climates with denser populations. you say waster of energy, but that's not exactly fair when it takes 10x as much energy because the distances are 10x as far. (actually since canada and china are somewhat similar in size, you can make a reasonable approximation that its more like 37*ish* x  the distance, and if things like transport are 37*ish* x  harder then the fact that our energy consumption is only double is really not that bad. this is where per-capita approximations can break down.)  if everybody in canada lived in the toronto metro area, it would be a much more reasonable comparison. 

i'm not disagreeing that canada's per capita emissions are worse. but its easy to overestimate how much of a difference can be made, especially when you're talking about individuals. fix the easiest thing first. fix the biggest polluters first. none of those big things are individuals.",liberals

our housing crisis is a combination of a supply and demand pressures. if you only build more, then investors will sweep in and buy them, blunting the impact on affordability.

housing can either be affordable or a good investment. a society that privileges basic material security for its residents over capital accumulation seems preferable to me. but i guess some people want to live in a society where everything is fair game and allowing people with money to make more money is more important than housing. it all seems needlessly ruthless when we have all the means to do otherwise.",liberals

the passage you quote, i always interpreted to be about the white liberals who were upset (or downright freaked out) by things like the mass marches and non-violent civil disobedience.  the school integration cases, the marches, mass attending segregated facilities and being mass arrested, the boycotts... and of course, the ensuing violence and chaos when these acts of defiance to segregation were violently repressed by vigilantes and sometimes the government.  

in that circumstance, one can most certainly be mlk's white moderate.  do you have to provoke them like that? do you *have* to do it now?  why can't you...

the thing is, what they were doing, and what they were demanding, were not unreasonable to begin with.  it was, properly, their right to sit on a public bus, go into a restaurant, or congregate at a rally, all along.

i'm not convinced that's the case with the statues, or with spitting on people.

now, the protesters out in bc over land use rights?  who sit their asses down until dragged out in cuffs?  yeah, i'm actually quite sympathetic to them.  defending their claimed rights by exercising them.  and i am happy to mock the people who act like that's a violent threat, too.",liberals

i mean, let's think about the solidarity people showed when the gm factory workers in oshawa lost their job in 2019. there was hardly any talk about the impact that poor policy choices had in creating this situation, because this was beyond politics, this was a matter of thousands of families losing their income. significantly more workers in alberta have gone through the same in the past decade or so, but any talk about that inevitably turns to saying \"well its their fault for electing conservative governments who failed to diversify their industry and relied too much on oil\". never mind the fact that the alberta economy *has* diversified since the 1990s, and that canadian governments of both political stripes didn't do anything to help with diversification, because they loved that oil revenue. when something bad happens in alberta, it's a matter of poor political choices, when something bad happens in ontario, it's poor taste to make it political. and they wonder why albertans have a chip on their shoulders🙄",conservatives

i'm a conservative (note the small c), but like many conservatives i was not born that way.  conservatives aren't born, they're not programmed from birth, they're made by cold hard experience.  as a wise person once said (no it wasn't me), a liberal is so open-minded they refuse to defend their own position in a debate, and a conservative is just a liberal who has been mugged by reality too many times.

of course kids (including university kids) are liberal and socialist, because why wouldn't they be.  all their lives, they've been told that they're special and that trying your best is all anyone could ever expect from them.  someone else has always paid their way, from food and shelter to entertainment and recreation, and they've been told a thousand times over that getting an education (in anything) is the key to success in life.  when most of your life has been spent on the receiving end of shared wealth (socialism), the concept shared wealth would definitely seem like a really sweet deal.

but then these kids get jobs (any job, doesn't matter), and they start paying real taxes.  they notice that nearly half of the money they work for is taken away before they even see it, and they start asking questions.  questions like \"hey, i worked hard for that money, why isn't it mine\" or \"how do i know you'll spend my hard-earned money on stuff that benefits everyone\", and they really don't like the answers.  at that very moment, that very second, even if they don't like it, those kids become conservative.",conservatives

by airing grievances on social media or to reporters, they were told, all they were doing was sowing division. o’toole promised to strike a task force to find a unified way forward.

making public statements about a politician’s position on an issue is only going to stir more reaction while getting very little done besides getting them votes (assuming the issue already has good coverage).

i'm not against new social programs on principle, but i want governments to be honest about the numbers behind them. the original idea was that gdp growth induced by stimulus would pay for new spending, but we saw in this government's first term that that's easier said than done. you can try to stimulate the economy all you want, but there are fundamentals beyond the government's control, like oil revenue dropping to historic lows, or a fuckin global pandemic disrupting supply chains and necessitating business closures.

the harsh reality that the liberals want to avoid saying, because it's politically unpopular, is that more social programs require more taxes. and in more generous welfare states like those in northern europe, everyone pays more taxes. not just the super-wealthy, but the middle class pays significantly more in income taxes, and even the poor are affected by sales taxes in the 20s. is this kind of taxation worth the world-class healthcare, education, and social services? the citizens of those countries certainly seem to think so, but their governments are honest about the relationship between social spending and taxes. ours, regrettably, are not.",liberals

i would disagree.  i think they've been making genuine efforts to change, but when it's something so indentured, tolerated and observed, it's hard to overcome.  also, the military, in general, is particularly resistant to \"civil servants telling us what to do. they don't know what it's like\" to be a part of the military.  and because, \"the good ol' boys\" run the show, it's hard for them to impose standards/traditions without upsetting the \"company culture\". 

i give props to trudeau for at least trying.  i think sajjan found out the hard way that he's either a military man or civil servant.  so, he either steps up, hard core and imposes new rules/regulations, and takes no prisoners, but then loses his membership to the officer's club, and all that. remember, this is part of his identity.  so, losing that is kinda like losing your right arm. if he doesn't, then he's an abject failure in the eyes of the public.",liberals

the shiny coat of paint on otoole is starting to get scuffed with more media scrutiny too, and his climate policy is a step backward for a lot of people and climate is one of the top issues behind housing affordability and covid. and as long as the more fringe folks in the cpc keep having their climate lockdown pamphlets unearthed, the issue of abortion and the issue of vaccination status brought up, the more the centre-left folks will lean liberal and the more abc voters will follow local late polls to pick the abc angle. 

quebec is a big battle ground and after sundays radio canada grilling otoole is probably going to lose some standing there. and there are two french debates. the p ovate network tva one this thursday in advance of next week's national debates matters too. 

frankly i think we'll end up not too far from where we were before the election in the end unless the cpc get a majority. a weakish minority might not even get a chance to form government if lpc/ndp have enough seats to form government combined - it will likely end up a supply and confidence arrangement between the two in that case. even with the poll  spread seat projections still give the lpc a lot of seats, at least on par with the cpc because of vote efficiency alone.",conservatives

one exemple, many researchs (many mades around 1955) of alfred kinsey, the father of the sexual revolution, have been found to have eitheir bad samples to even deliberate frauds. but because a lot of these researchs are used as fondations of modern sexology and and parts of psychology, these academics institutions still use and protect his researchs, even those that are officialy classified as frauds, because it would crumble a huge part of academia.

liberal being labeled the pro-science side of politics has given keys to easely shut up their opponents in debates. many scientists that belive in climate change but give legitimate critics on the way we are trying to resolve the problem are being labeled as climate deniers. look at study on how liberals see nuclear energy, it sickening.

i'm copying this from an earlier post i made 11 months ago. i've included the quote from the person i was responding to so that the rest of the post is in context (relatively).

the question of the we charity scandal comes down to whether or not trudeau breached the conflict of interest act. i think the following demonstrates that hasn't happened.

&gt;well sorry people, both justin trudeau and bill morneau did not recuse themselves from cabinet talks on the deal, despite both having family ties to the organization and having a \"duty to recuse\" under the conflict of interest act. 

where are you pulling this from? i'm reading through the conflict of interest act right now and i'm not sure i'd agree with those conclusions at all.


    gifts and other advantages

    11 (1) no public office holder or member of his or her family shall accept any gift or other advantage, including from a trust, that might reasonably be seen to have been given to influence the public office holder in the exercise of an official power, duty or function.

    marginal note:exception

    (2) despite subsection (1), a public office holder or member of his or her family may accept a gift or other advantage

        (a) that is permitted under the canada elections act;

        (b) that is given by a relative or friend; or

        (c) that is received as a normal expression of courtesy or protocol, or is within the customary standards that normally accompany the public office holder’s position.

following that it states:

    contracts with public sector entities

    13 (1) no minister of the crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary shall knowingly be a party to a contract with a public sector entity under which he or she receives a benefit, other than a contract under which he or she is entitled to pension benefits.

    marginal note:partnerships and private companies

    (2) no minister of the crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary shall have an interest in a partnership or private corporation that is a party to a contract with a public sector entity under which the partnership or corporation receives a benefit.

    marginal note:exception

    (3) subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if the commissioner is of the opinion that the contract or interest is unlikely to affect the exercise of the official powers, duties and functions of the minister of the crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary.

furthermore it's my understanding that both trudeau and moreau did follow the proper protocol as per the *confidental disclosure* section of the conflict of interest act.

    confidential report

    22 (1) a reporting public office holder shall, within 60 days after the day on which he or she is appointed as a public office holder, provide a confidential report to the commissioner.

    marginal note:content of report

    (2) the report required under subsection (1) must contain the following:

        (a) a description of all of the reporting public office holder’s assets and an estimate of their value;

        (b) a description of all of the reporting public office holder’s direct and contingent liabilities, including the amount of each liability;

        (c) a description of all income received by the reporting public office holder during the 12 months before the day of appointment and all income the reporting public office holder is entitled to receive in the 12 months after the day of appointment;

        (d) a description of all activities referred to in section 15 in which the reporting public office holder was engaged in the two-year period before the day of appointment;

        (e) a description of the reporting public office holder’s involvement in philanthropic, charitable or non-commercial activities in the two-year period before the day of appointment;

        (f) a description of all of the reporting public office holder’s activities as trustee, executor or liquidator of a succession or holder of a power of attorney in the two-year period before the day of appointment; and

        (g) any other information that the commissioner considers necessary to ensure that the reporting public office holder is in compliance with this act.

    marginal note:additional content

    (3) a minister of the crown, minister of state or parliamentary secretary shall make reasonable efforts to include in the report the information referred to in subsection (2) for each member of his or her family.

    marginal note:benefits from contracts

    (4) a reporting public office holder shall include in the report a description of all benefits that he or she, any member of his or her family or any partnership or private corporation in which he or she or a member of his or her family has an interest is entitled to receive during the 12 months after the day of appointment, as a result of a contract with a public sector entity and the report must include a description of the subject-matter and nature of the contract.

don't get me wrong moreau did in effect break the conflict of interest act by not disclosing or knowing that we paid for him and his family to go to kenya (something that he admitted and immediately paid back once he realized). 

trudeau is being investigated for sections (7) and (21) of the conflict of interest act which state:

    preferential treatment

    7 no public office holder shall, in the exercise of an official power, duty or function, give preferential treatment to any person or organization based on the identity of the person or organization that represents the first-mentioned person or organization.

and 

    duty to recuse

    21 a public office holder shall recuse himself or herself from any discussion, decision, debate or vote on any matter in respect of which he or she would be in a conflict of interest.

the question then becomes whether or not justin trudeau's family members being paid to speak for them (they're not the only organization that has paid various members of the trudeau family for speeches), demands trudeau to recuse himself from any discussion that might tread into territory where a relevant private sector company gave money to anyone in his family. 

to my mind this is utterly incredulous. imagine that trudeau had a brother working for oil &amp; gas companies as a lobbyist, does that mean that trudeau must immediately recuse himself from any and all discussions involving oil or gas? no. obviously.

now in this case it's likely that trudeau didn't act incorrectly with the conflict of interest act however it is likely that given the inevitable political fallout he should have recused himself earlier even though it was not required of him.

* snc-lavalin

this one was odd. if you read the conflict of interest act, section 9.

&gt; **influence** 

&gt; 9 no public office holder shall use his or her position as a public office holder to seek to influence a decision of another person so as to further the public office holder’s private interests or those of the public office holder’s relatives or friends or to improperly further another person’s private interests.

i'm certain that trudeau did attempt to influence wilson-raybould as ag but that he did it to influence another person's private interests i'm not so certain; unless the employees of snc-lavallin are those people. 

* aga khan

yeah i mean he didn't report that he went on a vacation. he should have done that, no question on that one.

if that's how you feel, that's how you feel. personally, i'm not certain these point to trudeau being unethical.",liberals

in the united states nate silver can sort of reasonably predict the odds of victory based on a polling lead. in canada, politics is too regional, too fractious, and while there's such a thing as party bases, voters here are too untied to a political party. reasonably often they completely disappear or develop out of nowhere.

at the outset of 1993, kim campbell had a small lead over jean chretien, and some hope she could claw out another pc government. she finished 25 points back and with 2 seats. 

at the start of 2011, jack layton started the campaign with 13% support in quebec, a distant 4th, and finished with the largest seat haul in the province since mulroney.

in the short term, i think you can make solid predictions. but we've got weeks and a debate to get through. quebec to figure out. 6 to even 7 parties that can at least influence the result. covid. and o'toole throwing a wild card by reorienting the cpc unilaterally. my stance is that there's *alot* on the table.",conservatives

[if i look at all the riding polls that have been published by mainstreet, i get the following differences compared to my projections: lpc: -1 seat cpc: +2 ndp: -1. only one seat projected cpc was polled lpc (aurora--oak ridges) while 2 seats projected lpc have been polled cpc](https://twitter.com/2closetocall/status/1432592098767867906?s=20)

[so in case you are reading that the riding polls are completely different and so much better for the liberals: not really. some results were surprising but the outcomes were the same.](https://twitter.com/2closetocall/status/1432592306767638528?s=20)

[and if we average the swing in ontario (where we got multiple riding polls), we get the overall %:  lpc 37.6% cpc 34.4% ndp 18.5%  so quite close to the polling average. a tighter race than in 2019 so far.](https://twitter.com/2closetocall/status/1432592939037908993?s=20)

edit: i asked what he thought of the ekos poll and he said

[nothing? i look at the average and trend. such quick rebound doesn't make much sense to me (or any big variations in general) so i avoid the sensationalism](https://twitter.com/2closetocall/status/1432602050521620480?s=19)

[i also think the two ivr polls were showing a lead that was too big. i expect polls tomorrow to show the cpc ahead but by like 3-4 points.
next big move i'll believe is after the debates](https://twitter.com/2closetocall/status/1432602530815619073?s=19)",liberals

heo6av4,2021-09-28T11:46:57.000-07:00,"if 2021 election was proportional representation, con 114, lpc 110, ndp 60, bq 26, ppc 17, grn 8, ind 3. well there's a lot to unpack there, you touched on a lot of issues. 

so i can't address all of them but i'll try to hit on the high points :) mainly 'how'. 

first off, for some of this to make sense we need to make a slight correction - most of the voters in the last election were about evenly split left and right. about 48 percent voted for right of center parties, about 52 voted for left of center. given the turnout it's fair to say its pretty close to 50 50.  but - regionally it tends to be a different story. 

so - to address that one factor that you noted that's important is respecting and even enhancing provincial powers. we don't need a lot of new ones, just strong protections and respect for the ones we have. ontario is left of center as a rule, the west tends to be right of center. with provincial powers people can elect gov'ts that reflect their own wishes. 

harper was a fan of that - and the bloc died under him. western alienation all but died too. trudeau didn't believe in that - and look at the mess we've got. so - power to the provinces instead of 'one size fits all' federal regs - and keep federal govts focused on their core responsibilities that provinces can't do. 

another avenue that can be productive is fringe/also ran party funding. not every fringe but when you get parties that actually win 5 percent of the vote or more - if you give them per-vote subsidies that gives them real money to actually hold the gov't in power to account, to promote their ideas, to push and lobby for specific legislation and to better represent the people who voted for them. they may not have more seats in the house, but money can be used to pressure the hell out of a gov't to do a thing. so - everyone except the number 1 and 2 party after the election gets a per vote subsidy. thats not too expensive because the main parties are left out, usually representing 3/4 of the votes, but the smaller parties get a boost and it actually means that your vote counts on the fringe because at least you're funding your party by voting. 

that gives people on the edge a strong voice without creating a mess of parliament. and allowes special interest voters like the greens to pressure for real climate change policy in an effective way. they have the money to do proper research and costing, and to lobby, and to do public awareness and pressure for change. money is, after all, power. 

tell the courts to fuck right off and allow term limits for senators and agree to pick from a pool nominated by the people of each province. that would go a long way to addressing regional differences. 

just some of the ways you could improve people's voices and democratic effectiveness without resorting to 'rule by committee'. and helps keep regional issues in line too.",liberals

the saddest historical figure i've read about was a young roman named sporus. emperor nero forced him to become whats known as \"puer delicatus\". its basically where they take young boys that look pretty, castrate them to preserve that prettiness, and make them boy toys. the greeks would have been horrified (too non-consensual), but the romans thought it was completely fine behavior. he ended up being passed to two more emperors and then killed himself to avoid a gruesome fate at the hands of emperor vitellius.blegh!

by the time of the byzantine empire, euneuchs were a regular part of the court, just as they had in china for a whopping 4000 years. the east had a thing about removing penises for some reason i guess. either way, the societies did not collapse because women were sleeping with men and men were sleeping with women.....and women were sleeping with women.....and men with men. and actually a few other pretty awful combos that would make even todays liberals go (0_o)

trust me, today's morals are pretty rock solid by most eras standards. and if you only pay attention to the psycho university liberals, you'll probably miss a lot of the media and articles that have been coming out where the craze of \"women sleeping with anyone is empowering.\" is starting to give way to \"sex is directly tied to and impacts psychology.\"

a lot of conservatives i've met have a paternalistic, black-and-white, right-or-wrong, my-way-or-the-highway mentality, and don't seem to understand, or don't care, that a democracy can't simply ignore the voices of the dissenters, especially when they form the majority of the populace. i live in alberta, and a lot of my neighbours and co-workers think that if a policy isn't true-blue conservative, then it's wrong, and implementing those policies would be saving canadians from themselves; they absolutely reject the notion that society should be molded by the desires of the members of that society, they believe that there is an absolute, pure, true form of government, society, and economics, and they believe that any non-conservative party is moving the country away from that system. they want to \"make canada better\", but they aren't willing to compromise in doing so, because they believe that there is only one form of government that could make canada \"better\". 

if the cpc were more like the old pcs, with more nuanced views of the world and a willingness to cooperate with other parties to implement small policy changes, i think they would garner a lot more support and actually be able to make those changes, but as long as they see things only in black and white they won't get anything that they want. i imagine a liberal minority that's propped up by the pcs would provide a fairly stable government that could last through the whole term, and the pcs would get a lot out of it that they want; compare that to the current set-up, in which it's distasteful for any other party to work with the cpc, who then achieve absolutely nothing and come across as angry and impotent. even if the cpc win a minority in the next election, they'll never be able to govern.",conservatives

- the right-wing generally panders to the rural voter in ways that the centre- and left-wings don't. they are interested in actively courting that vote, and as such their worldview has grown roots there.

- the harder-right fosters an extreme mistrust of liberals and lefties in ways that resonate with men, rural men in particular - painting them as physically weak or effeminate. these often draw on tropes of toxic masculinity.

- many of their criticisms aren't necessarily *wrong*. as leftists, we have indeed actually failed many of these regions. we need to invest in our rural communities if we want our country to prosper - that's just a fact. we need to invest in solutions for their schools, we need to invest in rural broadband access, rural *cellphone* access.

it turns out that if you abandon someone, they won't vote for you, even if it suits their best interests (which i obviously believe that leftist ideas do). this is a lesson i am *desperate* for the ndp to learn. even under layton, they hadn't grasped this. 

and catering to rural people doesn't mean being more centrist, or being more \"conservative\". i don't believe that the fundamental character of any community is left or right. i *do* think that you need to explain to people how your policies will benefit them, and their kids.

let me try to sum this up to you.

conservatives care about conserving specific things. these things include ***\"community, religion, family, health and tradition.\"*** these are all social institutions we are trying to protect. seems like you understand that part. any one that doesnt seek to protect all these things are not conservative.

the ussr isnt conservative for this reason. does your brain finally understand this basic point i have been trying to make to you? do you even now understand that the ussr did not care about ***\"community, religion, family, health and tradition.\"*** ??? should i repeat this to you?

that being said, to answer your question, as a teacher, you have a position of authority so it's inappropriate to be making political statements, especially in grade school or high school, with children. the word statement is important here since school also must teach critical thinking. if you're covering philosophy, history, social issues, you can't avoid these topics.

as for your example, flying a pride flag, i feel it's something that's perfectly appropriate at a desk in the teachers lounge but not really in class. not because it's offensive or anything of the sort but because it's just not the proper place for it to be. a teacher's job isn't to push their opinion but to promote discussion (depends on the class though).

it's also important to point out that homosexuality, like race, is not a choice, unlike religion or politics, so it's a human right to be the way you are.

as for a foundation, i don't see the issue, it's something that's outside class and it's a charity. christmas crafts, i feel that should gradually be removed but then again, as long as you're not asking students to make something blatant like a creche, it's not a big deal since christmas has long stopped being a religious holiday in quebec. my grandparents went to church, my parents/uncles/aunts mostly don't and my generation only goes there for funerals.

the issue with religion remains that that it doesn't belong in school. and it was gradually removed. first, nuns were forced to dress normally. then they were removed entirely from public schools. then came the introduction of alternate classes for students who weren't catholic. then it was changed to a broad religion class and then it was removed completely from the curriculum. some of these changes, i've witnessed myself and i'm glad it's gone.

but in the last decade, with increased immigration, we've also seen religion slowly creeping back under the guise of multiculturalism, with special exceptions as if religion is a special right different from politics. a classic example are sikhs being allowed to not wear a helmet on motorcycles in ontario. so i feel these laws are necessary to insure religion stays out for good.

next step should be to cut out funding for religious schools completely. our tax money shouldn't be used to subsidize religious teachings.",conservatives

if the liberal government was so concerned about gun violence they would do something about the utter failure of the cbsa to stop illegal firearms from being smuggled into the country and the gross incompetence of the rcmp concerning illegal firearm possession. the rcmp knew the nova scotia shooter had illegal firearms before the shooting, and they did nothing about it.

hq31ifk,2021-12-26T07:59:44.000-08:00,"andré pratte: quebec's radical rejection of catholicism behind support for bill 21 &gt;no. the issue is much more nuanced than this. and there is a big problem with removing them since most québécois recognise the historical validity and value of roman catholic symbolism that is woven into the very fabric of québec french canadian identity. \"je me souviens\" actually means something. 

i will never deny this religious heritage to  quebec catholics. that's precisely part of the reason why i oppose laicism. i don't want to deny any of quebec's religious  groups their heritage being put in full view by the state, not catholics, not jews, not muslims, and not anglicans. i know full well that the reformation-era tradition of the queen being anglican  or the king of sweden having to be lutheran  has absolutely no effect on the rights of anyone to be a jew, a catholic, or an atheist in these societies;  similarly having a french catholic symbol like the fleur-de-lys, and irish catholic symbol like the shamrock, or the anglican cross of saint george on the montreal flag doesn't mean i'll get treated bad because i'm jewish or lutheran. if anything, i know that  it's in 'laicist' or baathist states like france, algeria, syria, iraq, or china that the rights of religious and ethnic minorities have been and continuously (often  violently) supressed under the false pretense of state \"neutrality\". hence, any examination of practical facts shows  that the objection of  laicists or baathist  to religious expression on the part of minorities is  largely academic at best and a populist  and discriminatory dogwhistle by the extreme right at worst. 

in other words,  the state actively affirming anyone's  religious identity (i.e. not being laicist) is largely harmless; but by definition it's not laicist. i'm not a quebec catholic; catholic symbols like the fleur-de-lys are not my symbols, so let's not pretend that they represent all quebecers, and lets not pretend that it's \"laicist\" to have the state  elevate  catholic  religious symbols to national symbols. the french deliberately and with great effort purged all catholic symbols (like the fleur-de-lys) from their state; they made no bones that the white fleur-de-lys is a french catholic symbol of the virgin purity of mary,  the cross on mount royal is  there by  to claim the territory for catholic christendom, and  june 24  is the catholic holiday of saint john the baptist. these are simple historical  and societal facts, and just because people forget that and then get cranky and emotional when confronted with these facts,  doesn't   change the  historical and religious  validity of these facts. just because what they represent changes in someone's  head doesn't change what they actually represent in objectiove historical reality or  to the church. 

the denial of these facts is really  just self serving chauvinism that seeks to affirm the emotional identity of the white, francopone, secular catholic majority while denying it to others; this type of laicism  crosses  the line from a  benign expression of religious identity that you might find in swedish lutherans having their same sex marriage in the church of sweden or have a catholic state funeral for p.e. trudeau, to one where the law causes harm to religious, ethnic, and racial minorities through the kind of racist social exclusion that  you see in the paris suburban ghettos that many of the francophone arab muslims are attempting to escape in canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social\\_situation\\_in\\_the\\_french\\_suburbs) . 

in the end, for me, secular ideological purity  is not as important as allowing quebec catholics to benignly celebrate their catholic identity and heritage in the state in the way that they see fit ; similarly, i have no problem with jews or muslims, secular or religious, adorning themselves with items of their religious identity, be they secular or religious, even as judges or police officers. just as wearing national religious symbols like  the fleur-de-lys have no bearing on the ability of a white, francophone catholic cop at the sq to do their job (despite their racist record), a brown, anglophone muslim will not be impeded in her   job performance  by wearing a hijab teaching math, whether the meaning ascribed to  it is religious, ethnic, cultural, or just a fashion choice.  

my version of secularism is the one envisaged by the bna act and symbolized by the flag of montreal. you let the catholics in quebec (now francophones since we amended that section of the constitution in 1998) have their institutions, and the protestants (now anglophones) have theirs. if we can tolerate catholic symbols in  government institutions in the form of the  montreal flag with an anglcian cross of saint george  a catholic  fleur-de-lys, and mowhawk sacred pine as neutral, then there can be the reciprocal tolerance of jewish, muslim or sikh symbols when worn by individuals. in a secular state, all can be  treated equally as neutral and as part of a common quebec heritage. 

&gt;in some very real sense, laïcité has very little to do with religious minorities that live in québec.but they unfortunately suffer what is tantamount to--and i wholly apologise for using such a term--collateral damage. 

this absurdly false. religious minorities and the charter provisions that protect them are the deliberate targets of bill 21 and the preceding incidents involving state secularism since 9/11. absolutely nobody worried about catholic nuns running arount in their habits when this started; priests and nuns in schools were  firmly  30 years in history during the  the islamlophobic backlash  after  9/11. the current discussion culminated in the bouchard-taylor commission on \"reasonable accommodations\" for religious minorities in the context of this backlash: 

&gt;quebec’s consultation commission on accommodation practices related to cultural differences (commission de consultation sur les pratiques d'accommodement reliées aux différences culturelles) was launched by liberal premier  jean charest on 8 february 2007. **it was called in response to heightened public tensions concerning the reasonable accommodation of ethno-cultural and religious minority groups, mainly of muslims, sikhs and jews by the historically catholic french-canadian majority population in the province ... -** [**https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bouchard-taylor-commission-on-reasonable-accommodation-in-quebec-2007-2008?gclid=cj0kcqiawqcobhcdarisaepyw9mtx\\_v6864i\\_dwnnk5lwi19xyqd2hltfkusmdhos5d2hieh0uuxyxkaahenealw\\_wcb**](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bouchard-taylor-commission-on-reasonable-accommodation-in-quebec-2007-2008?gclid=cj0kcqiawqcobhcdarisaepyw9mtx_v6864i_dwnnk5lwi19xyqd2hltfkusmdhos5d2hieh0uuxyxkaahenealw_wcb)

&amp;#x200b;

specifically, here are the indidents targeted by the commission and objected to by the catholic majority in quebec:

* charter-based  judgment authorizing student gurbaj singh multani to wear his kirpan in school (see palbinder kaur shergill). 
* accommodation for muslim prayer sessions in the dancehall of a traditional sugar shack (cabane à sucre), 
* hérouxville “code of life” in which the town council  adopted a five-page “code of conduct” for newcomers. 
* in 2010, a quebec  muslim woman was expelled from a classroom for wearing a niqab. 

sorry, catholic women weren't sent  crying into the halls by quebec authorities for the crime of wearing a niqab  while trying to learn french. let's not pretend that muslim women weren't the main target here all along. 

 laicity is really  just a talking point for a small academic debating club in quebec. it really has little to do with this populist quebecois backlash against muslims, jews and sikhs which has much more to do with gthe right-wing media in quebec deliberately linking religious people with terrorism and misogyny.  as i said, the current incarnation has a lot more to do with the populist islamophobia largely imported from france and the u.s. via  the right wing media. they just use the language of laicism as a dogwhistle because they can't attack muslims directly. it's very thinly vieled though, and they're not fooling anybody. it was very clearly expressed during disgusting racist tirades during the bouchard-taylor commission, in the quebec media,  in the pq's diagrams when they were trying to pass their version of the act, as well as  in the [bloc's disgusting attack ads on the ndp](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bloc-qu%c3%a9b%c3%a9cois-anti-niqab-ad-takes-aim-at-ndp-1.2974146).",liberals

h8yfsjp,2021-08-14T07:16:41.000-07:00,"ivison: trudeau's about to call an election with no purpose — other than to gain more power &gt; asking the democratic process to stop because you might get an outcome you don't want (in this case, a minority government might become a majority) is as undemocratic as it gets.

i agree, and do concede that this point is correct. however, one must consider the possibility of mob mentality allowing for democracy becoming toxic in and upon itself. that's why i bring up demagogues. they exist on all sides of the spectrum, like it or not.

i would argue that a democracy is only at its healthiest, when the individual such as i can challenge the mob with recourse from their collective anger. if no one can challenge the mob, then you have a dysfunctional democracy. that said... 

we must also avoid tyrannical minorities. 

democracy. the least worst yet least best way of running a nation, at least when left to the unfettered opinions of the uninformed or worse, uneducated masses. note however, that's not to say many or any are better than it. but it certainly can become the worst in a lot of ways if there are not some cheques and balances in those who retain power. since the power is within the people...

a final word.

if the cpc wants to win back voters, like myself, they'll have to come up with policies that help the population as whole, and it can't be just cutting things or privatizing things, it's got to be building things, taking proper care of our resources for all canadians, working to ensure the best bang for our buck. the cpc has a looooong road back....",conservatives
