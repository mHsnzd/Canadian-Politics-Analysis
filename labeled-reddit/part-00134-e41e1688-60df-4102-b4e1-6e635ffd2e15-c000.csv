hf3nirx,2021-10-02T00:26:18.000-07:00,"eco-socialist dimitri lascaris is considering running again for green party leader i have also enjoyed this exchange, and i appreciate you mentioning that.

but i do have to say that there are two points you're making that i find really quite silly.

the first is the idea that because a political approach loses a few elections, that means that it is completely unviable and should be abandoned. people only ever seem to say this about the anticapitalist left, whose program has only had mainstream attention for the last 5 years or so. generally it takes longer than that to build up to a point where winning power is possible. the conservative revolution of the 1980s, for example, suffered multiple electoral failures. reagan ran for president three times before he ever even made it to the general election ballot. the centrist liberalism of the liberal party of canada was in the political wilderness, with very little support, for a decade while harper was in power, and yet nobody claimed that centrism can't win elections and should be abandoned. 

secondly, i really have to object quite strongly to the idea that biden represents a progressive program. he has offered a few olive branches to the left, true. but his program is fundamentally inadequate and he is still, ideologically, a capitalist. the infrastructure bill is not a green new deal under another name. it spends more money on highways and pipelines (!) than it does on public transit and rail. and all the social spending has been hived off into a different bill which, if it passes, will only be due to an extremely confrontational strategy on the part of the squad, which will cost them huge amounts of political capital.

i do find it interesting that virtually every time the democrats are in power, they're just a handful of seats short of making meaningful progress. there's always at least one or two blue dogs holding things up and stopping them from actually using their majority. this problem never seems to affect the republicans. personally i think this is a convenient way for the democrats to have their cake and eat it too: they can promise big things, like raising the minimum wage or eliminating student debt, and then when it comes time to deliver, they can just blame congress. this in turn gives them a reason to ask for more campaign donations. personally i think they may very well draw straws for which one of them will play the heel in any given congressional sitting. ultimately they don't actually want to pass any of the bold reforms they promise, because their donors don't want them to.",liberals

oh poppycock.

do you think one pipeline is going to save the planet?  you sure act like it does when you use this reasoning.

the pipeline's profits are used on green projects.  it was re-evaluated again and was approved.  but i guess that is a bad thing and it's better to just have a \"turn off all oil pipelines\" button to press to appease you folk.  how else are you going to fund projects?  money on trees?  jagmeet seems to think so.  most likely this pipeline ends up in the hands of the first nations; guess that will be bad for them to get some consistent funding from the pipelines for their needs.  let's not tangent on to drinking water as there is tangible progress and an 8 billion dollar settlement that jagmeet doesn't want to talk about when he puts out his misinformation

oil isn't going away for some time.  if you have a resource to use, use it to fund your green projects.  only the ndp/greens would see that this is bad.

edit: one more thing on the pipeline.. remember something called fipa?  we would have had our asses handed to us by china if we didn't get a pipeline to tidewater

this doesn't make any sense.  why can't they just ask them \"have you had promiscuous sex with multiple partners recently\"?  why can't monogamous gay men donate?  

if the answer is \"they might lie\", can't they already lie about being gay?  

i feel like people are trying to draw logic over what is essentially an old, homophobic idea.  i fear people might be trying to draw logic over it because of this anti-trudeau headline.  

when i *really* think about it, whether it's pragmatic - people's feelings be damned - to blanket ban all sexually active gay men from donating blood, the harder i think about it, the more it all seems like nonsense.  

seems like our own government came to that conclusion too:

for this analogy to be truly complete, the scenario would be one where both iv illegal drug users and iv insulin diabetes patients would both be banned, because \"people who inject things into their arms tend to have hiv\".

and the ban would be based on simply asking them \"have you injected anything into your arms recently?\".

and they would say \"well we can't just ask them if they've injected *heroin* or shared needles, we can't separate those people out from the diabetes patients, because they might lie!\"

and then i'd stand there, with a dumbfounded look on my face, asking \"how do you know they aren't lying about the questions we already ask them?\"

this doesn't make any sense to me.  this \"it's for everyone's best pragmatic interests\" argument doesn't follow logic.  it doesn't track when you really think about it.  yes gay people tend to have more hiv.  no, asking blood donors \"are you gay?  if yes, please go away\" does not reduce the risk of hiv in the blood donor supply.",liberals

some folks might be reacting based on it coming from trudeau, but personally, i'm not much for knee-jerk reactions. i am moreso open to the idea that people can be driven by emotion, despite evidence-based reasoning that conflicts with their views. that said, it is not as though one side is less driven by emotion than the other and evidence can be interpreted more than one way.

a government report is more convincing to me than conjecture, and i'm willing to accept their word on it, not because i necessarily trust them (they did create the ban...), but because they are the authority on the matter with access to better data than most. plus, i don't actually know much about the issues at play.

2. by party affiliation (e.g. voting for same party regardless, and there are solid ridings for each party, central nova used to be pretty solid pc years ago),
3. by platform, issue or policy, choose the mp which best address their concern, (underserved imho)
4. by party leader. the theory is by voting for an mp from the same party of the leader you desire, you increase the chance that leader will become pm. this makes the least sense to me, but many, many people think this way.
5. strategic voting, to reduce the chance of an undesired outcome, e.g. \"abc\" voters.

no, it really isn't.  that's a fundamentally different question that what we're discussing: which is your claim that trudeau is a do-nothing idiot \"bouncing off of walls\".  the changes over the last 6 years have been far in excess of what most governments achieve, and far from \"limited\".  these are *huge* changes.  daycare is a completely new federal social service, something that we haven't seen in *decades*.  legalization was a first at the federal level in the g8 and something that was unthinkable just 4 years earlier.  the carbon tax too is a massive policy shift that was considered political suicide before trudeau took up the mantle.  these are big, material achievements.

well first of all, you're comparing one harper term to two trudeau terms.   if we exclude the previous parliament (whose legislative agenda was, shall we say, interrupted by external events), trudeau has (according to your own source) broken just 7% of his promises - *half* as many as harper did during his corresponding majority.  secondly, we can look at the number of promises - 700 versus just 143.  trudeau has fulfilled more promises than harper *made*, and these were substantially larger promises than anything that the harper government aspired to.

hnh27fw,2021-12-06T00:19:02.000-08:00,"the future of the liberal party—without justin trudeau so, i'll break down freeland's prospects a bit.

first there's retaining quebec. trudeau's tactic during the french debate, definately not used during the english one, was to head off the bloc by doing a combination of playing the favorite son card and ~~condemning~~ (edit: a better word would be accusing, see the response from /u/urawasteyutefam below and my counter-response) blanchet for having the nerve to imply that ~~someone of mixed and somewhat ambiguous heritage~~ he isn't quebecois. this isn't a tactic that can't (edit: i typoed the reverse) be used easily by a successor. not every canadian national leader can come from quebec without the roc getting impatient (and who can blame them), but nationalism is a powerful force here. there's probably not a threat of separation near term, but there's alot of seats to lose.

i think a roc politican can retain most of the seats here, and make up for it by taking seats elsewhere. freeland could anywhere else in canada. but it's hard. just an accent makes one sound less credible in any language. debating effectively in the 2nd language is rough. there's a different cultural reality to be in tune with. it takes a disproportionate amount of work and alot of trust in your quebec deputies. if you're aspiring to be leader of the liberal party and canada in 2023 and you haven't started putting work in to figure out how to be adept in quebec, it's already too late. i'm not sure offering policy planks to make up for it is particularly wise either.

second, i get h. clinton or ignatieff vibes from freeland. i admire her intellect, her willingness to drift well outside her ideological safe zone, and her capacity to govern. but leader of the party involves two other, different things: holding together a party caucus and inspiring though campaigning. i see no proof there of those skills, and this article is not reassuring.  

i'm not sure if i'm just kowtowing to sexism in making this judgement. sexism is something to fret over, morally, and with the alternatives not being utter lunatics like the us i'd even say finally taking this sexism head on would be worth losing an election over, and women once made leader win elections as often as men. \"cold and aloof\" though tends to not be personality traits well correlated with being a successful progressive leader, at least not in 2021, which i find unfortunate as sort of a nerd.

people will tire of trudeau. maybe trudeau has tired of people. but i do think he has one more victory in him (probably yet another minority), and feel his prospects are better than freeland's. maybe some outsider could do well, but i'm not sure who. at the federal level, you have to appeal to alot of different groups these days to just win a minority, yet alone a majority.",liberals

h6n8k7d,2021-07-26T09:24:24.000-07:00,"ford government must not leave vaccine rules up to private groups &gt;  you can't legislate out of constitutional precedent. it may be common law, but it is based on the constitution, and can't be superseded without constitutional amendment, which is egregiously difficult to obtain. the only way to avoid supreme court precedent is to use the notwithstanding clause.

that still requires that the precedent be directly applicable. with a new law they could make an argument along the lines of \"it's a very restricted scope, and global pandemic\" to explain why precedent might not apply, and gradually add more and more to that restricted scope. if you accept the idea that forcing a person to share any medical information with an arbitrary entity is acceptable the rule goes from \"you shouldn't need to share your medical information with anyone other than your doctor\" to \"this piece of medical info might be required for your safety, so you must share it with anyone that asks.\" from there it's only a matter of what society considers to be \"required for my safety,\" and i'm not willing to just write a blank check on that.

&gt; this is largely my point. we already have the tests we need for this. it's unprecedented times but it isn't completely novel subject matter.

i would say that context matters quite a bit here. during normal times there is no way that the idea of forcing people to share their medical info would pass those very same tests you speak of. the only reason we're even considering this is because these are unprecedented times. i don't have any indication that our protections are strong and robust enough that they will be able to prevent government overreach after giving up such an important right over such a broad segment.

&gt; this, to me, just sounds like you aren't familiar with how our healthcare system functions, and are motivated by fear of the unknown. the amount of money it would cost to mandate vaccinations would be a rounding error in the provincial health budget. they wouldn't be building a vaccination police force, they would just be adding a checkbox to somebody's wsib registration and re-tasking some auditors.

i work as software engineer consultant in this segment. on an average week i might talk to stakeholders at hospitals, clinics, pharmacy chains, and governments. if the government were to implement a system like this, there's a non-zero chance that i might be involved at least indirectly.

simply implementing this system is likely to start with a price tag in the tens of millions. remember, this system would be a need to have direct access to the medical files of all canadians. right off i can tell you, that's not a simple process, and it involves many different contacts across multiple organizations to even consider starting a project like this.

this is just to implement the system; never mind the fact that you would then need to provide training material for literally all the businesses in the country, never mind the support issues. of course this system could *not* be allowed to go down, so this means 24/7/365 monitoring and response team, multiple regions, fallback servers, and scaling to meet millions of requests per minute.

i assure you such a system would not be a checkbox. implementing something like this would be a humongous effort requiting many thousands of man-hours of work from a lot of different entities.

&gt; i've worked in labour law for years. it is entirely correct.

so then again, why do so many people ignore these regulations with impunity?

i get that in court you're correct. my point is that in the real word many people have absolutely no respect for these rules, because in most cases they have no teeth.

&gt; they didn't get punished because there are thousands of instances of working at heights going at any given time in a given city, and inspectors can't be everywhere

you're right, traffic laws don't become voluntary when cops aren't around. yet i wouldn't be surprised if both you and i driven 20 over on the highway, only to be passed by the cop going 30 over to get to their coffee break. illegal in the absolute sense. absolutely. illegal in the practical sense? well, i haven't been stopped in that situation yet, and i know the cop knew i was going over the speed limit.

again, there's a huge difference between \"laws as they are on the books\" and \"laws that society actually follows.\" if the vast majority of workers in the city get ignored, while a few of the major offenders get fines, that's not a strong law. that's just something the government can use to go after entities that don't play by the more important rules, or are really flagrant about it. after all, inspectors can't be everywhere, and they clearly need to prioritize somewhere. it's just interesting how priorities usually tend to shift towards those not friendly with the people in power.

&gt; i don't give a damn about the harm they're inflicting on themselves. i'm concerned about the disruption and the costs of disruption borne by society at large that could come from another surge, should it happen.

so then what is the bridge you're willing to die on? before you seemed to be willing to defend people from making bad decisions that might lead to death. now that's seems to be significantly extended to, \"a lot of people were greatly inconvenienced.\" the people worried about future unemployment have free access to a highly effective vaccine. those people can now opt for an effective and cheap defense. my question then becomes, why do we need to protect the dissidents from themselves?

if another surge happens, it will most likely happen because there is a variant that is able to escape the effects of vaccines at a sufficient to be dangerous, and the surge would happen not just happen in the 20% of anti-vaxxers, but in the 80% of people that now thinks themselves well defended. in that case the issue would not be resolved by a few more anti-vaxxers get the vaccine. it would be a systemic failure of the vaccination program, and it would likely have to be resolved with more lockdowns, booster shots, and so on.

&gt; yes, they are. if you walked into a store and they said \"by the way, we require an email address on checkout,\" and you said no, they could ask you to leave and you'd have no recourse.

that certainly does not align with the policies i have heard from friends who have actually been in positions to collect emails. there would usually be policies bending over backwards to avoid a potential privacy pr nightmare. for some of these businesses i have trouble believing they'd do this unless they were forced to.

at the very least i need to be able to unequivocally state that i do not want this email to be used for marketing purposes (which of course a simple store clerk can not guarantee), otherwise i would at least have some right to complain based on the anti-spam legislation. in any case, i could not find any direct examples, but i did find [this](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/research/explore-privacy-research/2008/ipsos_2008_01/). given that 46% of people appear to be willing to refuse personal information, and there's no major dramas about stores forcing the issue, then at the very least the right of such a refusal is baked into the social construct, assuming there's no actual law forcing the issue. if you're in the legal field then this should be a question right up your alley.

&gt; they have private property rights, and can ask you to leave the premises, at any time, for any reason. it's not good business, but they can do it. if they engage in some form of malicious discrimination based on a prohibited ground, then you might be able to make a claim on a discrimination basis, but generally, you're probably not likely to succeed, and if you do succeed, it's probably going to be nominal in terms of the time and resources you've invested. and most discrimination claims succeed where there is no rationale operating in their favour - a global pandemic which, right or wrong, has scared the shit out of everybody, is an extremely strong legal argument for refusing to serve somebody.

so, they can do it, except when they can't. you appear to be stating unequivocally that me refusing to give up my right to privacy can be sufficient grounds for a store to deny me service. if you're this sure then i'm sure there must be at least something you can cite to back it up? i don't mind if i'm wrong, but i would certainly like to see more than your word for it.

&gt; and most discrimination claims succeed where there is no rationale operating in their favour - a global pandemic which, right or wrong, has scared the shit out of everybody, is an extremely strong legal argument for refusing to serve somebody.

right, but that's not really a strong argument to compel me to give up my information to someone that is clearly scared shitless, and it makes be doubly less comfortable to be forced to do so in this situation.

&gt; the bigger issue isn't customers, though, it's employees. i doubt many businesses, if any, will require vaccination of customers, because it's a headache to implement. but some will undoubtedly require employees who use their space every day to vaccinate, and that's not crazy at all in my opinion.

i don't have any problems with businesses requiring vaccination of employees. in fact i would certainly prefer to visit a business that makes it clear that all their employees are vaccinated over one that has not done that. 

my only issue is when it comes to legislating interactions between total strangers. if i walk into a store and someone asks me to scan an app or requires me to take out some special card, that's when we've got problems. i say that despite the fact that i actually carry my vaccination card with me. as long as it's something i do purely voluntarily, it's fine by me. hell, even if trudeau goes on tv and recommends everyone does it, as long as it's an individual choice i don't mind.",liberals

&gt;with the exception of jack layton’s extraordinary orange crush in 2011 — an electoral phenomenon that propelled stephen harper into a majority government — the federal new democrats tend to be political parking lots. that is, people park their votes with the ndp between elections — and then stampede to the liberals on voting day.

&gt;new democrat organizers say the enthusiasm for singh and the social democrat option is real, this time. they are seeing huge turnout at their rallies. and the numbers reflect newfound ndp strength — which is a clear and present danger to trudeau, in urban battlegrounds across english canada.

um. the data shows that the ndp might be only a threat to the liberals in ontario at the moment where they have a shot at gaining at max like 4 seats from them. i think it's possible they take back 1 or 2 seats from the liberals at best at this point in ontario. elsewhere the ndp is mostly a threat to the cpc and greens. as long as the liberals continue to poll high in urban canada the ndp is not much of a threat to their prospects of getting a majority. the bloc is a bigger threat to the liberals chances of forming a majority because if the bloc does about the same or slightly better in quebec next time it will be harder for the liberals to form a majority government.",liberals

other factors i can think of:

* jack mentions cost of living, maybe anglophone immigrants are more likely to migrate to montreal, where the cost of living is simply higher than the regions? the study i link point to a better salary outside of montreal as well
* bill 101 forces immigrant children to go to francophone school. maybe it increases access to the market and employment opportunities after the second generation while successfully converting immigrant population to francophone?
* are there simply more anglophone speaking immigrants as opposed to francophone immigrants? how do these proportions play out?
* are anglophone immigrants selected from \"poorer\" backgrounds? quebec controls immigration but only for experienced economic immigrants who come to fill economic needs in the province. meanwhile, federally-selected immigrants are either (1) refugees or (2) family reunification.",liberals

hirypm7,2021-10-31T01:59:25.000-07:00,"liberal mps say justin trudeau is ignoring them. the pm should pay attention &gt; use of their federal jurisdiction over water…

there are a few things here. first, the ceaa 2012 regime regarding impacts on waterways remained consistent with ceaa, so major projects remained subject to scrutiny where they impacted waterways. second, it’s easy to get up in arms over the issue when it’s been framed as eliminating oversight over water. but that’s a gross mischaracterization of what happened. the previous act was overboard and captured things that shouldn’t have triggered federal oversight, largely because it intruded in things that would have otherwise been provincial jurisdiction. it was unbalanced. what the harper government did was establish a schedule that cabinet can update when and as needed to ensure that important navigable waterways aren’t harmed. the lpc didn’t change that approach when they came into power; they just added to the schedule. to summarize, there was a lot of duplication between the modern environmental assessment regime and the old nwpa. the harper government streamlined the process and, despite the histrionics of environmental activists, maintained a relatively similar level of protection through ceaa 2012. 

i don’t support his attempts to constrain what government scientists could say or research, so i agree with you there, generally. at best, i understand he had an ideological preference for small government and didn’t believe that was the role of the government. i disagree - as do many others - but i suspect there was some logic to his actions, even if it was bad. 

as for your comments on the census, you’ve gone a little bit too far. it’s pretty well documented that he and his cabinet opposed a mandatory long form census on ideological grounds (libertarian leanings) and not because the demographics studies purported to show what you claim. you’re confusing your opinion with fact, especially considering that most of the social supports his government implemented followed a direct funding method. 

many were and remain okay with cancelling nationwide daycare. i certainly don’t support it, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the quebec experience is decidedly unclear as to whether it works all that well. as for whether it pays for itself, there’s some logic to the proposition that an increased labour force generates more government revenue, but the evidence isn’t actually all that clear. there’s some reporting on this, but the anticipated increase in labour force participation is only anticipated to be ~3.5%, based on quebec data. the quebec government really only expects an increase to gdp of 0.05% as a direct result of childcare. 

regarding gst, i’m okay paying less in tax. you’re assuming that higher tax rates are an inherently good thing. the gst is regressive and was only every intended to be temporary in the first place. and i can assure you that we are not facing a funding crunch because he knocked 2% off the gst. we’re facing a funding crunch because it was politically advantageous for the lpc to spend like drunken sailors through the pandemic. some of it was necessary, a lot of it wasn’t. 

finally, on the scc appointments, literally every prime minister appoints superior court justices that they are ideologically aligned with. trudeau certainly has. the justices harper appointed have turned out to be some of the better justices we’ve had for some time. point to one justice he appointed that hasn’t been a good addition to the court. i don’t love cote, though i appreciate her willingness to dissent because i disagreed with the former cjc’s drive for increased unanimity. i understand why she led that effort, but i think dissents strengthen our jurisprudence. of the current court, the weakest links are trudeau appointees (rowe and martin).",liberals

it's also worth noting that we stopped mass killings with the mini-14, not by banning it, but by restricting its sale to trained individuals who have been properly vetted by the government. 

i'm not interested in getting into a debate about 'need', since all we need as humans is food&amp;water, shelter, and social standing. anything beyond that is supliferous. anyone can argue that someone else doesn't 'need' something, especially when that thing isn't of any interest to the one doing the arguing.

let's talk about mass killings in canada. since 1969 there has been 11 mass killings in canada. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_massacres_in_canada?wprov=sfla1)

of those 11, 7 were committed with guns. sounds terrible right? except that two of those were acts of gang violence, committed against fellow gangsters. 

that's 5 individuals who had clear mental health issues and  had access to a firearm. there were another 4  individuals who had mental health issues, but no access to a firearm. they still managed to hurt a lot of people.

our country failed to help 9 people within 52 years. 9 people who fell through the cracks and managed to do something horrible. i'd say overall we are doing a good job. 

the ruger mini 14 came out in 1973. that means canadians have owned them for 48 years with only one mass killing using that weapon. are you really trying to tell me that it's the weapon that caused the issues and not the individual when there is years of non-data to backup my claim?",conservatives

hasuxwf,2021-08-28T23:36:48.000-07:00,"globe editorial: why giving people more money to buy homes won’t make homes more affordable first, you have to realize that we are screwed. that no politician and no authority will or wants to make a change. some of them are profiting from this situation too (my best bet is on trudeau and the uk royals, the same crew that does the war profiteering by selling the weapons). voting will not help either. 

so what will ?  see, the problem is, people do not want to live in affordable slums. we all want to have a comfort... the comfort is a luxury that currently costs $1 million in larger cities and surrounding areas. people will still want jobs too... so unless the large companies and institutions take a head out of their ass and start decentralizing themselves nothing will work.

also, the comfort is becoming a luxury in other domains too.  it is harder to find the affordable and good-quality furniture, clothes, food, etc. all good quality and cheaper products are taken off the production line.

they might tell us that all of this is good for humanity because it keeps the population number in place... the only thing is, canada does not even have the population large enough to support the claim... we regulate the population by doing the human trafficking or immigration as you call it in finer terms... but only to repeat the same, and make the situation even worse.

the future model of our society has been described by dostoyevsky, and not shakespeare. we are heading in the direction of becoming a society of the naked, homeless, uneducated, and starving.  how else do you think the money would have more value to those who have it ?

the fact that this is a law that targets individuals, specifically targeting those things that don’t really exist in catholicism but do in other religions, has a grandfathering and does nothing to address 99% of religiousness in public life( tax-breaks for the religious or that 90% of québec municipalities and government infrastructure is named after religious figures etc etc etc) ... indicates that yes **this was a law about bigotry**. the hypocrisy and ridiculousness of this law’s drafting make bigotry the only explanation.",liberals
