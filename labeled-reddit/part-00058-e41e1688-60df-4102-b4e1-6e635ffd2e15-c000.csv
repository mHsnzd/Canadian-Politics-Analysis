they invited people over for a party while waiting for their covid results. and then tested positive afterwards. all people at the party then needed to be tested and were potentially contacted by contact tracing (hopefully in time). 

this isn’t an isolated incident either.

the equation to calculate sem is however connected to the number of samples (in this case 4 polls). on days where we have less, sem will go up, on days where more polls come in, sem should go down. this is of course assuming that variance between the polls remains the same, which is the other major input.

the sem across the 4 polls today isn’t really that high, just notably higher for the ndp and cpc, which indicates that there is more uncertainty in their topline number then, say, the liberals. it’s very probable that the liberals are hanging in that 30-31% range, at least in this snapshot.

i think i’ll continue to do this over the coming days and add average and sem changes. it might be able to indicate whether the polls are “converging” on a consensus for each party or not.

lots of stuff in here had already been covered over the last week's.  the $10 a day child care which is already rolling out, 10 days of paid sick leave for federal workers, hiring 7500 more doctors and nurses, home owners bill of rights etc. 

 new things on first glance, more money for the cbc so they can ditch advertising.  that's cool. repealing mandatory minimums for low risk drug offenders.  passing a law mandating abortion access, that's a big change at the federal level. a new tax on high income earners.  

a right to repair home appliances is in there with a tax credit to help pay for repairs.  special change to the copyright act to make sure digital devices can be repaired. 

chapter 6 is entirely devoted to reconciliation, with lots of details devoted to that.  clearly an area the liberals want to run on 


lots of health stuff, some of which was mentioned on the campaign trail already. big increase for mental health coverage especially on universities.  also money for virtual health care which blew up during the pandemic

for those wondering, 'racism' appears in the document 28 times and 'islamophobia' appears 3 times.  no mention of puppies, not even in the 'protecting animals' section.

ambitious goals are good to have, sure. but goals that are achievable is what will motivate the population into doing more, having already felt like they’ve accomplished something. people need that reward to continue doing hard things, or else they get frustrated and want to quit.

yet when people protest against old growth logging at fairy creek, the rcmp violently beat them, pull their masks down so they can pepper spray them, destroy their property, censor media reporting on the situation, and fling sexist and racist abuse at them.

and when homeless people try to live in any way they can in a society that outright rejects them as sub-human, the tps raid their homes, destroy all of their things, beat them and their defenders senseless, and arrest everyone involved.

as someone who did negotiating for a small media local and can say without a doubt we had no leverage to bargain for better wages because they knew there was less than zero chance there would be a strike. hell the last time there was a strike at my local (before my time) i think it was lloyd robertson who walked across the picket line.(pretty sure it was him again it was before my time, i might be confusing him with someone else) 
 
&gt;that's not the common practice with back-to-work legislation; if the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, the relevant minister will select one.

so from the union perspective, the government forces you back to work destroying any leverage you have. then the company hard balls even the mediator selection and the government (who as far as you're concerned has already taken actions that are in the best interest of the company and against your own) is to appoint a mediator and i am to accept that person is impartial.   

a ton of your argument is arguing that process are fair and not designed to protect capital. this is of course natural for someone who refuses to even admit that marxist annalist valid. its faith in our systems of government that can only exist if you refuse to be truly critical of our history and our present. 

&gt;but when the strike also imposes real costs on the economy as a whole (e.g. delayed mail delivery), that's an additional set of victims. these \"nationally important businesses\" can't be easily replaced by their very nature, so customers and the public at large are also harmed with no direct way to intervene in the dispute

you make it sound like forcing worker back to work isn't the same thing. it stops workers from being able to take meaningful collective action and make any real change. it artificially suppresses wages and priorities the interests of capital. it only allows for the most minuscule nibbling of the edges. which has detrimental effects on all of society not just the workers at a particular workplace. 

if labor can't stop a port from shipping and receiving or a mill for spitting out logs, they can't win. collective action come with collective burden. the argument you make is comfortable inflicting burden on society as long as its not at capitals expense too. the rest of society in is just the preachers wife yelling \"won't someone please think of the children. \" as if forcing teachers back to work when they are fighting for smaller class sizes is a selfish endeavor by the union that won't benefit our children and society as a whole. 

i'm not arguing that police unions shouldn't have limitations on what is negotiable i'm arguing that 9 times out of 10 the liberals and back to work legislation is make society worse and boarders on evil. 

&gt;another reading of this is that the canadian public is a lot more ambivalent about this than union organizers would prefer, especially when it comes to services that impact said public.

&gt;look at this empirically: if labour rights as described here were so popular, then back to work or other union-hostile legislation would be so risky that the \"transactional\" liberal party would never touch it.

it is fair to argue that society doesn't support unionism like it used to. but it is also fair to say that government has been one of the main supports of the destruction of the house of labor. do we teach kids in school where the 5 day work week came from or that police in canada have killed strikers in the past? how many high school economics courses teach marx next to adam smith? 

no one will ever teach you how to take power from their control. capital is in control of government. 

it is the job of leftists to educate and promote the benefits of collective action but they are fighting against a foe that has more resources and systematic control of the dissemination in information and creation of culture. if its not brand friendly it doesn't air. the internet is a new hope for the disruption of the current configuration of society but as demonstrated time and time again in the us uk and canada political parties will never stop trying to regulate the internet back into their control.  

&gt;look at this empirically: if labour rights as described here were so popular, then back to work or other union-hostile legislation would be so risky that the \"transactional\" liberal party would never touch it.

we live in a society where even wearing a mask became repression on par with the atrocities of wwii. boomers and post 60's society have been optimized by supremacy of the self. every time there is a movement to change society ie occupy. institutions of structural power are always going to be better organized, better funded, and more able to control the narrative. i believe that capitalists have been very good and giving society just enough that everyone has something to loose but not enough to revolutionize and not soo little they are desperate.  the actions nessassary to make real change take courage and sacrifice. i don't believe conditions are right for change to happen. we keep comming close but never get there.",liberals

likely will replace it with a tax credit, which helps people who don't need the help the most.

&gt;we've already talked about the conservative climate plan when o'toole released it in april. he seems to be fighting his own party over it.

his past proposals summed out to doing less and rewarding people from consuming more. it's not likely to be better than the current policy road map.

&gt;the conservatives are promising generous temporary funding for businesses to encourage more jobs: a canada jobs surge plan to pay 50% of the cost of new hires, a 5% tax credit on any capital investment in 2022 or 2023, a 25% tax credit on up to $100,000 invested in a small business, a $200,000 loan (up to 25% forgivable) to businesses in tourism/hospitality/travel, a gst holiday for a month (for retailers), and a 50% rebate for dining out for a month (for restaurants). that last proposal sounds similar to something the boris johnson government did.

tax credits are the worst form of regressive policy. it pays people more the more money they make. it's also the conservatives favorite form of policy. the gist of the plan seems to be rewarding businesses that are already okay and then some encouragement to go eat out.

&gt;the conservative plan includes doubling the canada workers benefit (an existing wage supplement for low-wage workers), which seems like a good idea.

that'd be nice, depending on the implementation.

&gt;finally, to cool the housing market, the conservatives are promising a two-year ban on foreign investment in real estate. in bc, there's already been a lot of measures put in place in recent years to increase scrutiny and taxation of foreign investment in real estate; i'm curious how people here will feel about an outright ban.

it's been less than 1% of new sales since the national foreign buyers tax went into effect. eliminating it all together isn't going to do much for the market. it would be popular with many as it's targeted a group some canadians already hate, foreigners. but it will be pointless.",conservatives

i am one of those people. i am making the argument i think i am. i don't think covid-19 justifies any meaningful infringement on bodily autonomy. partly this is true *because* we have such a high rate of voluntary vaccination. i might feel differently if only 50% of the population volunteered for vaccination. but canada has one of the highest rates of uptake, this is about all you can expect for any vaccine, and i don't think the risks post voluntary vaccination at the rates we've reached, justify meaningful charter violations.",conservatives

for example, he says here:
&gt;introduced last november as part of canadian heritage minister steven guilbeault’s mission to “make web giants pay”, **the bill was steadily and stealthily** working its way through the parliamentary process with only a few days of “clause by clause” review left before a final reading and vote in the house of commons.

implying that the process through which the bill has been worked on has been hidden from the public. this simply isn't true, even if the actual process of working on the bill through the heritage committee isn't exactly prime time television. you can, as far as i know, go and watch any of the committee meetings and read the documents submitted on ourcommons.ca (video is on parlvu.parl.gc.ca/).

similarly, geist says:
&gt;indeed, bill c-11 was promoted by prime minister justin trudeau last november as legislation to give canadians greater control over their personal information, but under newly named isi minister françois-philippe champagne, it has scarcely been heard from again.

which is weird, considering it appears to have had a [second reading on april 19, 2021](https://openparliament.ca/bills/43-2/c-11/). no doubt its movement has been sluggish, but then, many of the bills have been for some pretty obvious reasons-- that's a far cry from not being heard from again. 

i think in many ways this opinion piece does a lot to show, really, what's at the heart of geist's objections here, because i don't really know if i believe the whole 'free speech' angle of that has been pushed repeatedly. i think its more accurate to say that he simply opposes any sort of regulation at all for companies like facebook. these companies have not really demonstrated any sort of willingness to regulate themselves, and indeed, have demonstrated repeatedly a disregard for their own capability in real problems they've created. so i'm not really on board with that sort of libertarian ideological stance.",liberals

but once things got tough he started taking things seriously and working with the federal government, uncharacteristically of him. of course that's the bare minimum, but since expectations of him were so ridiculously low, the bare minimum was all he needed to look good. it also helped that people often compared him with jason kenney and donald trump--compared to kenney and trump, doug ford has done a great job. this is why most conversations about doug ford's performance these days go something like \"he's doing a good job, and i didn't think he would. i mean, just look at how things are in alberta or the states, we're pretty lucky to have ford.\" in other words, he's the least clownish clown in the circus.",conservatives

it is likely that they have adopted some political positions that are borrowed from both the right and left, and for that reason they don't identify with either camp. you can evaluate those positions and compare them to your own, and perhaps you'll find them to be more to the political right or left. that said, i don't think you can take these evaluations and comparisons and make a *universal* statement about *all* centrists.

the fact is that this demographic is predicated on its independence from left or right political factions. they aren't homogenous. in fact, because they are 'stealing' positions from both the political right and left, they often contradict each other.

an example might be a pro-life person who happens to believe in government aid and welfare. they might feel compelled to call themselves a centrist. someone who is pro-choice, but likes small government might also call themselves a centrist. can we say that these people, who both identify as centrist, are compatible? not easily.

can we easily place these people on a political spectrum? do we evaluate one of these positions as being 'worth more' than the other? also, how do we place each of these positions on the political spectrum? where is that demarcation line between the left and right?

&gt;a conservative party communications staffer responded to the questions by email, and said that the answers could be attributed to o'toole. this is standard practice for outlets seeking anodyne responses to straightforward requests for information about policy or position.  
&gt;  
&gt;however, levant took those answers, spliced them together with his original questions, and called it an exclusive interview. he published it yesterday.

i'm not exactly politically connected person, but i would expect it doesn't require much access to get an answer to \"what is the party leader's position on x\" written by some staffer. honestly i thought that was the standard way politician's respond to all constituents. that's not the same thing as an exclusive interview.

i had to look up \"anodyne\", which means \"not likely to provoke dissent or offense; inoffensive, often deliberately so\", which makes me think even more strongly that this basically amounts to what any random constituent would receive when asking.

though i would certainly say that maybe the cpc needs an openly stated policy of \"don't ever interact with the rebel in good faith\", and i'm happy to criticize them for the lack, that's not criticism of them than the one being made, and it's one that's likely to provoke less outrage.",conservatives

i have seen this argument used a lot. pr systems often use a vote threshold somewhere between 3-6%. that means if those fringe parties don't get at least that amount of the national popular vote or win in a riding election, then they don't get represented. even if they did somehow win a few seats, who is going to support any of their ideas? which parties that add up to having 50% of the popular vote would support extremist legislation?

parliament is canada’s legislature, the federal institution with the power to make laws, to raise taxes, and to authorize government spending. the parliament of canada is “bicameral”, meaning it has two chambers: the senate and the house of commons.

proposed government legislation is introduced in one of the two chambers, usually the house of commons, by a minister. bills calling for the spending of public revenues or for the imposing of taxes must originate in the house of commons. once introduced, a bill is subjected to a detailed process of review, debate, examination and amendment through both houses before it is ready to receive final approval. the house of commons also considers items of private members’ business, that is, bills and motions proposed by members who are not cabinet ministers. 

https://www.ourcommons.ca/about/ourprocedure/parliamentaryframework/c_g_parliamentaryframework-e.htm#5a

inflation is a monetary phenomenon as you point out. the bank of canada determines inflation full stop. there are transitory fluctuations, but they have target and will be hitting it most of the time. the bank of canada has a target of 1%-3%. currently inflation is 3.7%, which isn't exactly far off base. blaming the current government for inflation politicizes the bank's job, which is the opposite of what we want if we are hoping for stable and predictable inflation.

a lot of this is just silly as well. canada's pandemic response has been a huge success relative to the rest of the world. yes obviously mistakes have been made, but every government of earth was making tons of mistakes at the beginning. this was unprecedented. hold the government accountable yes, but don't blow this out of proportion, and don't pretend another party would have been able to steer clear of pitfalls.

&gt;what fascists do when they are at the height of their power vs what they do and say in order to get to that point are very different things. dictionary definitions tend to focus on the first part.

we should judge people based on the words they actually say rather than whatever subtext we think might be inferred. accusing someone of something without evidence is another component of fascist ideology. 

&gt;this creates an impossible scenario for those who want to oppose fascism, as enlightened centrists demand we wait until they are already in power and committing atrocities before it is fair to say they fulfill the full gamut of fascist criteria.

oh please, this belongs in the cess pit of twitter, not anywhere that reasonable discussion is had. 

our society fundamentally is contrary to the authoritative nature of fascism. in order for actual fascism to take power in canada, our legal system and the structure of our government would have to be rebuilt from the ground up. to something that facilitates an authoritarian dictator and allows for the curtailment of charter rights as well as economic restructuring. this is not something that will happen over night and without the will of the people. short of a violent coup, this 'threat' of fascism in canada is about as unfounded as whatever drivel the anti-vaxxers are spreading these days.",liberals

hcqucmj,2021-09-13T08:02:29.000-07:00,"[deleted by user] thank you. despite being in the minority there is still 3+4 million gun owners in canada who are negatively effected by these useless gun bans (however the rcmp has said 2.5mil, but that number is from 1998 and has grown since). to put that into perspective, there are 2-3x more people who are interested in firearms than play in all hockey leagues combined in canada.

not only are these gun bans ineffective against gun crime, but they criminalize normal citizens by saying \"you have to give up your firearms, many of which are extremely expensive or are historical artifacts, or you go to jail\". a lot of people will not comply, as has happened in almost all countries that have instituted gun bans. nz has a 12% turn in rate, even with their extremely screwed record of firearms numbers. this just creates more criminals out of normal citizens who had never hurt anybody, all because the government doesn't want to deal with the real problems which cause violent crimes: illegal firearms, mental health, failure by the rcmp to follow up on our pal system flags, and more.

in canada politicians push the narrative to scare the public into thinking certain guns are \"evil\" and that they must be banned. trudeau has gone so far as to demonize people who own them, saying the only reason you'd want to have one is to kill someone. firearms should be regulated with facts and statistics, not feelings and political moves.

also, it would surprise a lot to know that up until 1990s every firearms related ban or regulation in canada can was in direct reaction to first nations use of firearms, whether it be the original license from the 1920s-30s which made it illegal for natives to own firearms, or the ban that happened directly after the oka crisis, which just so happened to include all the rifles the natives had used to defend their land.

nothing, the article is actually really hard on the ndp, basically noting that the ndp have never been popular in toronto, and even in their breakthrough of 2011 they still got third place in the popular vote. the most substantial part is quoting an \"ndp insider\" who suggests that the party start trying to court tory voters over liberal voters, while an ndp candidate who lost in 2019 explains people are \"ready for a refund\" and will switch to ndp.

interesting to see that the ndp are trying to rerun the same strategy as last time again, wonder if it'll work. the article really does showcase the broad disconnect with how the ndp view toronto voters and how toronto voters vote. paul taylor, the ndp candidate is quoted as saying: 
&gt;“there’s a significant progressive voter base that — if i’m honest — bought what the liberals were selling in 2015,” he said.

i really don't think this is the tone the ndp should be setting. i don't know if taylor means this, but i don't think voters like being told they were essentially duped. gives off a bit of an \"we were right you were wrong we told you so vibe\", which seems especially silly considering those same voters gave taylor a thrashing in 2019.",liberals

honestly i think this speaks to the influence of marketing upon politics and politicians. instead of actually responding to issues and connecting to voters as a priority, they instead commodify themselves as a brand to \"sell\" to voters. they look good, say the right things, are seen doing the right things, but seldom do any substantial heavy lifting. all the parties are guilty of this to varying extents tbh. 

anyways i think it is a real negative trend for canadian society, and cheapens the political process severely. the danger is that they can look good, make voters feel good about them, and still accomplish little as their electability is tied to their 'brand', and not their accomplishments. our present govt(as well as the one before it to a lesser extent) is indicative of this - canada has high self-esteem but little to show for it.",liberals

focus on this particular case.

meng wanzhou is wanted in the united states on charges related to sanctions-busting and fraud. she was detained by the rcmp at the vancouver airport while transiting to a different country. a canadian judge has ruled that these charges are valid. she is appealing this decision, which is her right.

so far, do you see anything untoward here? i don't. if the charges are bs then she should fight them there, no? it's not like american courts have to follow the government's demands, they rule against them all the time.

knowing that, why is beijing losing it over this, engaging in the sorts of actions that won't just be noticed in canada but in lots of other countries?

my theory is that they know meng will be convicted and as a result one of their elite will end up doing time in an american prison if she actually faces the charges. they know washington was gonna be a hard sell during trump's time in the white house and biden will be a harder sell still, so once there if convicted they won't be able to get her freed.

so they bully canada, seeing trudeau (who has never been a hard-shelled sort) and our country and thinking that taking canadians in china hostage would force us to give meng back so she never faces the american charges.

[according to the oecd total income tax on canada was 267b. property tax was 85b.](https://www.oecd.org/tax/revenue-statistics-canada.pdf) if you triple the property tax you s generate 170b. therefore you can cut income taxes 64% (my bad)  with the new revenue.

the property tax rate in toronto is 0.59%. the average home in toronto is 1.1m. so 3x the property tax works out to the person paying \\~13k a year more. that works out to 1,083 a month. at 2% interest and 25 year amortization that works out to 3,700 a month in mortgage for the average home. if instead you have to allocate that 1,083 to property tax you can now afford a mortgage of 2,617. that payment can purchase a home worth 650,000. so tripling property tax would lower prices by 41%.

there would be a countervailing impact from the increased after tax income on home prices, i haven't calculated it yet but i will eventually. 

in canada you are not allowed to walk away from your home without declaring bankruptcy. in the us you can walk away and nothing else happens to you.

home prices vs incomes are currently completely out of wack *on a national* level. a 40% drop would be a wonderful thing to bring that ratio back into line. that's something to rejoice as it prevents us from being a feudal society where all that matters is your parents wealth. 

anyway i'm a homeowner it would destroy my net worth but i'm willing to do it because i think it's a just solution and i'm wiling to sacrifice for the overall health of the country.",liberals

it was a joke of a piece of legislation that was put together hastily, without consultation, and without any fundamental understanding of how even the most basic, vanilla, above-board workplaces function. 

it was entirely inevitable that it would be repealed but the lpc was so desperate for headlines they didn’t care. very little in that bill was salvageable, the idea of two paid sick days might have been but that was a small component of an otherwise burning pile of crap.

edit: i think one of the highlights of that legislation to me was it changed the holiday pay calculation such that someone who was scheduled to work 9-5 every second day would receive a full day of holiday pay while someone who works a half day, 5 days a week would receive a half day of holiday pay. i really think it was devised by interns and built to be repealed so the pcs could look like the bad guys, while in reality it needed to be repealed because it was broken.",liberals

when the ndp timidly does centre-left policy that is less ambitious than their rival, it does not achieve this.

true housing affordability, and specifically lowering housing prices, has not been the focus of a government in a long time. the lpc and cpc have some ideas on how to address it without lowering prices for current homeowners. as does the ndp. no party is currently offering lowering prices, at least not with any credible plan. the ndp's amounted to $ to send to landlords last election and was panned by affordability experts as being worse than the tories', if memory serves.

with all of that said, no, lpc is not much better. banning blind bidding will help a bit. they've done a bit toward financial transparency of ownership but not enough. their rent to own scheme sounds good but still not sure how practically it could be implemented. there is no major party currently advocating for wholesale lowering prices because it would 1) tank the economy and 2) kill the savings of the majority of canadians and their families, specifically the ones who vote. even millennial homeownership has hit about 50%, which a lot of those buying in the last two years.

all of this also ignores 1) inflation is above 2% everywhere in the world and is widely thought to currently be transitory and related to shortages of supply rather than government spending, and that it is the case where government spending is not higher, and 2) the notion that government spending creates inflation is largely a misnomer, particularly when borrowing is kept well within an acceptable range of debt-to-gdp.",liberals

if you want to do this, parliament can pass a bill against the wishes of the lpc saying parliament can declassify something if it passes a majority vote. then make the explicit decision to do so, perhaps after they are briefed on the likely consequences. or you can argue in court that the inherent supremacy of parliament over mere legislation (as opposed to something like the charter) already lets them do so.

it is quite correct, because there is a huge asymmetry here between judiciary and democratic representatives in the approach you support. a single judge can effectively change what the charter means through his interpretation of it, but it would require a super-majority of canadian provinces and the federal parliament to reverse it, something that has never been achieved since the constitution patriation (which was done with a knife to provinces' throats as the federal government had the greenlight to proceed unilaterally if provinces said no).

h1zx1ec,2021-06-16T04:27:36.000-07:00,"bill c-10 hits speed bump as speaker voids dozens of 'secret' amendments as far as i know, amendments aren't published at all. there's no list someone can look up and see what every amendment is, so in that sense all amendments are 'secret'. typically the amendment is read out loud to the committee, and by extension anyone listening or watching the proceedings. however, because the house voted to limit discussion, after the five hour mark the committee was only allowed to vote, not debate, and since reading it out loud is the opening move of a debate, they couldn't do so. (note: this appears to be confirmed by the comments made by the chair right after the ruling at 17:07ish)

&gt;and also that they were added after debate limited? i’m assuming that the speakers ruling would have been on the advice of parliamentary staff so would have some basis in the rules?

i've asked elsewhere and not received any sort of clarification; keep in mind that the committee already had a huge list of amendments to go through, and certainly new amendments could be added outside of that package during the normal run of the committee. as they're going through the bill clause by clause, though, i have the impression that they ran out of time allotted and chose to continue on with clause by clause post the time limit, and those amendments are now tossed.

however, for the sake of this post, i tried to pin down the exact point where this was being discussed in committee, and frankly what i found was a bit disturbing. [it starts at around 16:41 in the video](https://parlvu.parl.gc.ca/harmony/en/powerbrowser/powerbrowserv2/20210610/-1/35702?language=english&amp;stream=video). the committee runs out of the allotted 5 hours for debate/etc, and the standing order limits them to continuing clause by clause by voting; no debates, no new amendments or sub amendments. and no motions-- which is important.

after the time runs out, they have a short break, and when they come back the chair makes two rulings on where they go from there, based on the standing order from the house. the first is a ruling that he makes where he says, at the start of the committee, they made a rule for themselves that the green party could propose amendments, and those amendments would be moved. this means they're under the wire for the standing order's instructions. they're already moved, and therefore, the chair rules, they can be voted on in clause by clause.

the second ruling is the problem: none of the other party's amendments have been moved. they're not moved until they're actually before the committee being discussed/debated/voted on. as such, *any amendment from any party that isn't the green party could not be voted on.* this is what the liberals challenged the chair on, and overruled him, so they could carry on with clause-by-clause (just voting, no debating or discussing since the 5 hour mark was gone).

i'd be interested to know if the speaker also ruled against the chair's first ruling, about the green party amendments still being votable or not, and/or if they got scrapped as well. perhaps ironically, since i've taken so long to write this post out, the chair actually addresses the \"secret\" part just after the ruling and comments that perhaps in the future the system could be set up so the amendments could be shown to those watching the proceedings. so it actually sounds like it's more of a 'how they do business' issue that hasn't come up before and therefore results in just the code for each amendment rather than the text of it being given.",liberals

the way he dealt with sloan, which, let's be blunt, was completely trumped up, demonstrated weakness and fear of his own base. he should have thrown him out of the party the day after he was elected, and stated exactly why he was doing it. that would have both sent a message to the grassroots and to the rest of canada that he was going to run a tight ship, that he wasn't going to even appear to entertain anything that could cost him. he lost that opportunity, but he still has some time to make it clear that he will be prime minister, not pro-life pressure groups and not climate deniers.",conservatives

that's fair, and my point wasn't to suggest that those realms are utopias either (anymore than canada would be even without s.33). the key here is that rights are a social constructed concept and they exist along a spectrum. we can generally say that the uk or nz shares most of the same values and generally upholds its citizens' rights even without the courts forcing them to do so, even if certain rights are more or less respected at any given point in time. the same is true in canada, we just turn a lot of the decision-making power over from the democratic realm to the technocratic and legalistic. there are pros and cons to such an approach.

&gt;i also don't think relying on voters to punish politicians should be the only safeguard, especially in systems where a minority of voters can have majority representation.

agreed. institutions matter imo. it just happens most of our institutions are maintained by unwritten constitutional conventions. for instance: it's not as though we have a law which defines a \"confidence vote,\" requiring a premier or pm to resign after losing one (or for that matter, a law which defines the position of \"premier\" or \"prime minister\"!). but the institutions that create and maintain those conventions are rather strong, and it isn't a coincidence that the crises which would occur if those conventions were ignored are unprecedented.

&gt;i don't think a charter should be the only safeguard either, i would prefer both.

as i said, institutions matter. the charter is an institution unto itself. section 33 is a part of that institution, attempting to balance out parliament and the courts and maintain dialogue between them. but if we reach a point where using s.33 is seen as uncontroversial, apolitical, or \"just the thing the government does when it loses in court,\" then we'll have a big, big problem. vigilance matters. the charter doesn't protect our rights - we protect our rights, by defending the charter.",liberals

point by point:

* the ndp took a very strong stand against selling weapons to the saudis, and even the liberals had the good grace to be embarrassed about it. 

* every party in canada thought the syrian war was a disaster, but it's hard to see what to do about it. bashar al-assad is uncontroversially a monster. daesh are horrifying. there's nothing to argue about.

* several canadian politicians spoke out against the fighting in nagorno-karabakh and the pm called for peace. plenty of social media yelling went on. [according to the 2019 exports of military goods report](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/controls-controles/reports-rapports/military-goods-2019-marchandises-militaries.aspx?lang=eng#_toc38893618), canada doesn't sell arms to azerbaijan, and sold a whopping $1453.20 worth of arms to armenia.

* we actually bombed daesh in support of the kurds during the harper years. probably a good thing to do. hardcore lefties are also  super supportive of kurdish municipalism. nevertheless, short of sending soldiers to defend rojava, there isn't a lot to argue about in canada.

* every party in canada that i can think of said something about how awful the coup in myanmar is. no one is on the other side of that issue. canada has joined international sanctions against myanmar in support of democracy.

we sold about $14 million worth of military hardware to israel in 2019. (the 2020 report is on the way but i couldn't find the document itself.) that's not a huge number, but it isn't zero. we have some responsibility for how those weapons are used. we also tend to support israel internationally, while we routinely condemn the bad guys in all those other conflicts.

now, you could argue that those weapons are being used well, and that israel ought to be supported, diplomatically and otherwise, by the canadian government. i think there's a case to be made. but now you're back to having the actual argument, as opposed to an unconvincing exercise in whataboutism.",liberals

knowing what we know about the decades following ww2, the multiple overthrowing of \"dangerous\" or unfavorable governments, the known inciting incidents that were not real, and the emphasis on promoting commercial interests over people's lives. 

why do we take anything our intelligence communities and people inciting escalations take at face value. is it not blindingly obvious that the last at least 80 years has been about gaining and maintaining our own control at the expense of literally anyone in our way.

why should i take this seriously when 17 years ago it's wmd's, 30 years ago it's incubator babies, 50 years ago its gulf of tonkin. why should anyone trust our community when we are trying to overthrow legitimate governments as of last year. not to mention all the horrible people we installed as leaders because they were favourable to our interests. 

some years its funding rebel groups then a few years later there is an extremist terrorist problem from those same groups. how about we learn from our past and stop finding, creating, and sometimes making up enemies for going against whatever our 'values' actually are.

they couldn't be wrong again could they?

on a serious note, i do think there will be a fall election.  assuming things return to normal by the end of september the liberals will need to act fast to capitalize on their success ending the pandemic and before they have to start making the tough decisions on the financial side of things...might be best to have a majority government for those.",liberals

then there is the flip side, the people who are taking this seriously who are aghast at how weak his actions have been and are very worried that a third wave of the pandemic will dwarf the second.

povery reduction (and downright elimination) is a worthwhile goal, especially where children are concerned, and we should be implementing more policies to the effect of the uccb to combat poverty, but ubi has become a populist panacea. 

the pbo's recent costing was for a program that would leave huge numbers of disabled people, singles with dependents, and other vulnerable groups *significantly worse off* than their current status, all while costing $90 billion a year. thats not a good result.

where's the 4 billion for a nuclear plant that was funded and cancelled?

the billions spent on buying fixed price solar tech, that got cheaper year after year. which we knew would happen.  

what happened to wasted funds on the 12 year infrastructure program from trudeaus government? 

what happened last year when successful businesses that thrived during the pandemic got billions in government money to subsidize their operating costs, which they ended up using to pay out historically high dividends like tfi international did. 

what about the fair hydro plan? i guess you think the total extra cost of 30 billion plus 19 billion in interest would be been a tiny number? 

or the nanaimo cruise terminal? tens of millions spent on alroject that didn't even meet 10% of its expected usage.
