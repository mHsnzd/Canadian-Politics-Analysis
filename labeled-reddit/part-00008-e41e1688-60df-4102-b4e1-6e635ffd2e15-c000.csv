1. this still doesnt address my point. my position is **not** that the economy diversifying is undesirable, my position is that for a worker who is **currently gainfully employed**, but views losing their job as a risky situation (something i would wager applies to most workers in most places), campaigning on policies that would actively jeopardize their employment is unlikely to win support.

saying \"there is funding for retraining\" is unlikely to shift that voter's opinion, because it's still a high risk bet. would you willingly quit your job and **hope** that a) you are able to successfully retrain b) a job will exist for you when you finish retraining.

that's a risk many people take once in life, called university, and in most cases thats when people have the least to lose. established professionals with a lot to lose are less likely to take that kind of risk.

2. say i am an oilfield worker, and i receive retraining to build solar panels. this does me no real good if there are no jobs in solar manufacturing where i live - provided i do not wish to leave. indeed, however trained i may be, there simply may not be **enough** jobs in my field, as any freshly graduated communications major could tell you.

more generally, while wda programs are desirable, with the exception of covid relief, federal spending in alberta and saskatchewan is still net negative, so you'll excuse me if i'm not falling over shocked at ottawa's magnanimous generosity. the fact that alberta and saskatchewan's governments are also incompetent is hardly relevant, given the topic is why westerners don't vote liberal, not whether they **should** vote liberal.

if the lpc and the ndp want to make friends of voters out west (or indeed in any non urban region) they need more concrete proposals than \"retraining i guess\". make economic investments in these regions, at a higher rate than in other regions, given the unbalanced economic impact of the policies that the lpc and ndp support.

and lest you think i think that should only apply to the west: the maritimes arguably need that even more. still, that's a longer term strategy. the federal government could **immediately** take action to 1) increase the direct linkage between out-region citizens and the federal government and 2) improve the economies of those regions.

as to the rest, these are solid proposals, but will come with enormous costs. what you're talking about as much as anything is telling federal employees they have to move so that workers in alberta do not. i'm not saying it's wrong, i'm saying you want to disadvantage one group to help another. the feds are going to have to kick in a lot of costs for relocation.

as to pulling money out of other regions, it's a risky venture with no certain pay off in and of itself. quebec is the most obvious risk here, what's the point of buying off western separatists only to inflame quebec separatists. the federal government is responsible for an entire country.

and let's be honest, unless the western provinces (and by that i mean mainly alberta and saskatchewan) want this kind of help, they're going to have to bring something to the table other than kenney's penchant for endless invective and blame hurling. while keystone xl, for instance, was likely doa due to the court cases against it in the states, regardless of a trump vs biden win, kenney's battle against federal carbon pricing made it a pretty easy decision for biden. if ottawa cannot call the white house and say \"yup, we'd like more pipeline projects, but we'll balance that with a solid long-term carbon reduction scheme that the provinces are on board with\", then kenney's court battles and general demeanor literally take cards out of the federal government's hands.

but one way or the other, o&amp;g is going to fade. it is inevitable. with or without economic diversification, no one thinks prices are ever going to leap up to the heights seen a decade ago. right now, canada is caught between literal energy giants as they fight to be the last man standing in thirty or forty years. nothing canada can do will ever be able to overawe the saudis. so perhaps the first step is a recognition that economic diversification is necessary or alberta's economy will find a new normal far below what it is used to.",conservatives

if we restrict scc candidates from outside quebec to be bilingual that would severely cut down on the number of qualified judges to consider.  simply being \"bilingual\" would not be enough when listening to and discussing complex legal issues in a second language.  these judges would probably still need interpreters.

smaller government.

so its not necessarily not spending, its not spending on extras and special groups.  yet it still could mean having a healthy social safety net.   for instance. small government for many wouldn't have a ministry for the status of women, or two ministries for indigenous issues (might not even have one) - small government might mean not having any special needs ministries.   its not that one doesn't care about women, indigenous or other special groups that big government sets up ministries for, its that people would be treated the same regardless of any group affiliation and therefore be covered by the services of the smaller government.   

i tend to ask does the canadian arts community thrive or suffer because of or in spite of government programs?  should there be government arts programs?  how small do you want government depends.  i've heard many different things from artists i know over the years, getting grants because of they are insiders or because they aren't, getting grants because of their gender or \"race\"....  its uncomfortable stuff.  does this aspect of arts funding make sense today like it did 2 or 3 decades ago - i mean the point was to help canadians get exposure because yes, decades ago there was a challenge to compete in a world where you are drowned out by american neighbours - but these days, its all about being online - no one can claim they are denied exposure and opportunity anymore when any art can be put online and judged, surviving on its own merit or being dismissed.  the economic conservative would stop the public funding broadcaster from competing against private broadcasters - why is the cbc paying for olympic broadcast rights when a private company would have paid for those rights instead - the economic conservative is furious at this; the olympics is a big example but other contracts that they compete with private corps for is just as big an ethical problem for the economic conservative.

basically i want a government with left wing ethos, but a very limited scope and a huge fear of unintended consequences of policy.

could the tax burden be lower? i guess so. it probably *would* be lower if the government were involved in as little as possible, but that's not why i (or really most libertarians) want limited government. i want limited government because government is the thing that holds a monopoly on legitimate violence. the entity that is allowed to take your stuff, beat you up, and throw you in prison should stick to only doing things that require and warrant those powers.",conservatives

and in fairness they have two actually accurate talking points about temperature \\*in general\\* 

1) pointing out that the roman and medieval warm periods are about as hot as we are now, and 

2) that between 2000 and about 2015 we were actually fairly plateaued in temperature change. 

however, they completely ignore why we are hot now and the rate of increase that got us here. also the fact that energy sources were are using now are not renewable, and even if we totally ignore global warming, pollution isn't good for health in other ways.

personally i hate the argument that they want to keep the oil industry afloat. even if we went as renewable as possible, oil will still be a thing for planes, rocket fuel, some ships, and other specialized areas that need a concentrated non-nuclear fuel source. also, as much as we're trying to ban single-use plastics, plastic for other applications is most certainly not going anywhere. the industry size will adjust but its not going to cease to exist like the buggy whip business.",conservatives

it's not ethical when there's a huge power divide. employers can force employees into agreeing to any number of unsafe, unethical choices if they fear about needing their job more than they are concerned with the unethical behaviour. even more so if they are in a job where they are easily replaceable. just because they may agree because they need to agree for their survival doesn't make the behaviour less ethical. how can you be comfortable willfully ignoring this reality? in other contexts, this sort of action by people in power where they force the person with no power into consenting is criminal. 

&gt; government supports increase reservation wages not the other way around. companies would pay people less if you didn't have government supports as people are more desperate for income. just to make sure i understand how are you defining a livable wage or being underpaid, is it based on whether they receive government supports? if we as a society agree that people should have a certain standard of living it makes sense that supports come from the government so that the costs are bourne by society. i do not think it makes sense for society to say these people should live at this standard but this specific economic actor should pay for everything. 

this is a lot of big word talking points but i don't think you've really thought out what this means. i think we start getting into the ballpark of an acceptable living wage when a full time worker can support themselves within the bounds of the cpi at an annual salary that will allow them to live within their means. (say a non-decrepit 1 bedroom apartment in a low to middle class neighbourhood, that person should be able to afford the basic living expenses, and be able to comfortably live paycheque to paycheque) this isn't an exorbitant lifestyle, and one that the average person would probably want to grow and expand past (by getting a higher earning job), and if they wasted their money living outside their means it would be their fault. minimum wage does not meet this standard. if you can't support yourself living this lifestyle on minimum wage, there's a societal problem.

the only way this talking point makes sense is if you don't think that someone working full time should not be able to afford to live based on that income.  do you agree that someone working full time should be able to support themselves based on those earnings or not? 

to address a recurring theme, if a business cannot pay it's worker a livable wage as defined above, and remain profitable, they are shifting the business losses onto the workers, and taking profit (that shouldn't exist) for themselves. this basically is a zombie company hiding their debt in the lack of salary of the worker. i know that it's very common in right wing talking points to ignore this. society cannot be a healthy functioning society if businesses think that they can expect 100% of a full time worker's time (40h), but only pay them 50%(or any number less than 100%) of what's required to live. if a business wants to employ someone in order to earn more money, that's great, but there needs to be a minimum standard that's met. businesses have every right to try and innovate and save money, but you can't abuse a unbalanced power dynamic in order to force an employee to take on the businesses losses because they can't be profitable based on doing things ethically. part of the risk of owning a business is accepting the losses. that's why they also earn the profits. if you only take the profits, and push the losses onto the workers, they are abusing the system, and it's the role of government to stop it. to make this issue worse is companies still follow this practice even if they would be profitable after paying a livable wage just to earn more profit. 

tl;dr - if a business can't afford to pay it's workers a fair living wage, then it's pushing it's losses onto the worker rather than accepting the risk they took when they decided to run the business and it's a failing business. if a company can pay it's employees a fair living wage and chooses not to, that's just unethical. a fair living wage shouldn't be a race to the bottom, it's a fixed cost of choosing to hire someone to earn more money.

&gt; as i said above if we want to help people and lift them to a certain level of income it should be a cost bourne by society through general taxes (which would include corporate taxes) not by companies. government mandated price floors on wages will result in the least skilled in society having much more difficulty finding employment as their labour gets priced out of the market directly hurting those most in need of help. you only benefit from a living wage if you have a job.

this is just wrong. it was an argument used by conservatives when the minimum wage was created, it was wrong then, and it's wrong now. society has benefited from a minimum wage, and back then it was a livable wage. only through corporate greed and lobbying has this gap between minimum and livable been created. 

to address your taxation issue, i again think that you haven't thought through the talking points you're repeating. it sounds like you're in favour of a guaranteed minimum income, which is a solution to fix these problems borne by corporations not paying their workers a livable wage. at the end of the day though it's still the upper class, and corporations that have the room in their net worth to pay for these programs. we can debate where and how we pay for these help to the people who need it, but you're in agreement that the problem is the same. i think we need wealth redistribution to start right at the paycheque before the money gets lost in corporations and offshore account, and by not creating more government programs (which you think aren't efficient anyways). paying people more at the source is a cost effective way of starting to fix this problem, and avoids inefficiencies where wealth is lost.  if you stopped parroting talking points and thought this through, you'd realize we're actually closer in views than you think. you just highlighted that you see the same problem i do. we can debate how to fix it.

&gt; bringing benefit and actual driving a return are different. spending $100 dollars to get $50 dollars means there was a benefit but it is not an optimal way to utilize resources. i am not advocating no government, public private hybrid systems that deal with infastructure, healthcare and education are fine. but all three of those systems in canada are desperately in need of an overhaul. 

throwing out random numbers may sound good, but it's again a talking point that doesn't actually make sense. with public services there can't always be a roi so your $100 for $50 is meaningless. what's the roi on saving a life? you can't calculate that. the public service may be risk adverse, and methodical in it's approach, and that can be spun into it being inefficient. in my experience, public servants are way more hardworking and passionate about the work they do then underpaid private sector workers. let's talk about the inefficiencies there. i don't know about you, but i don't want there to be cuts to safety, and ethical behaviours when it comes to how my grandparents are treated in the hospital. i'd rather someone be paid more, care, and be diligent about the care they receive. that goes for the other services government provides. you want to privatize the cleaning services in health care, sure. you want to privatize the building that public servants work in, okay. there will be more corners cut, and problems created, but with proper regulation, that shouldn't negatively impact the services provided to canadians via the public service. the public service should be evaluated on it's efficiency (compared to previous years), but to compare to what a private company could do is not good. there are benefits to having good process, and workers that are motivated, and when it comes to essential services, i want that over giving profits from cuts to the already wealthy.

&gt; i never said there wasn't waste in the private sector, but if a company is not profitable in the long term it fails or gets overtaken by competition. government doesn't have competition and taxes are not optional so it can become bloated with few consequences. 

or those companies can hide their losses by exploiting their employees. there are also companies that are too big to fail that just get handouts from the government. this is just a one sided take, that doesn't look at the other side. it's not a coherent position. companies that are too big to fail also become bloated with few consequences. there are many companies that should fail, but aren't because they are too important to society. this is a bigger issue than government waste, and you only reflecting one side of the issue isn't helping fix anything. it's pointing fingers at the wrong problem. external competition is not the only way to reduce inefficiencies. you can debate how we fix this issue, but the solution isn't ignoring companies that are too big to fail and misrepresenting the private sector. it's a issue on both sides, and if you have a solution that fixes both, i'm all ears. i think there are more pressing issues that need solving before we fix this one though.",conservatives

supply side economics then. trickle down is a political term to describe something that is a failure of an economic principle - supply side economics. the point if you read everything i said was that people believe things that aren't true, that doesn't make it good policy. conservatives largely believe in political views that just aren't true. supply side economics doesn't work. increasing the minimum wage doesn't increase inflation beyond standard inflation increases. climate change is real. people still feel like all this garbage is true. it's not. end of story. it is bad policy to act as if these things are true. it is bad for our society to have one side continue to throw out lies, and misleading people.

&gt; if the government is actually as efficient as you have said why wouldn't we have the government own all business?

the only claim i made about government efficiency was that it isn't as inefficient as you indicated, so this is just a strawman argument. falsely misrepresenting my views may make you feel like you're winning, but it's just losing. government should have services that are essential for society, and are either not profitable, or cutting corners to ensure profitability would hurt the services rendered. the service provided must be more important than the theoretical profit. profit is not the most important thing in society. 

this is not to say that government should be inefficient, but that we need to not think of efficiency and profit as the only evaluating factor when it comes to government services. metrics of effectiveness (which should include efficiency) are better. a government service that starts being less effective per dollar should be looked at, and determined why this occurred. is it waste (bad employees, poor use of money)? being too risk adverse? or was there external factors explaining it?",conservatives

the ndp benefitted from enough progressive and disaffected liberals joining their ranks but once again opposition is still not anywhere close to forming government. those remaining 26 seats matter and they usually aren't competitive in them enough to get them there. the ndp in other words squeezed every bit of potential they had more or less in that election.

dude, you're not operating in reality.  each time the conservatives have gotten power in my lifetime they've privatized and destroyed things.  each time the lpc has gotten in power, they've staunched the bleeding, but the money just isn't there to endlessly rebuild something that you know the opposition is just going to tear down and sell for pennies afterward.

petro canada, connaught laboratories, our entire aerospace engineering sector, and so many more.  hell, mulroney privatized and sold damned near half of our crown corporations - businesses that were decades in the building, sold for pennies on the dollar.

you underestimate the lost value, and cost of replacement.

in terms of rebuilding - something like 140 of the 230 campaign items that the lpc ran on were just unfucking things that the cpc had broken.  pre-pandemic, domestic vaccine production just wasn't that high a priority.  i don't think it even made the list of campaign items.

2. how well does canada do in this regard compared with the united states, japan, the uk, germany and so on?

i think that knowing if mr. trudeau is screwing up or succeeding *right now* isn't something we're going to know for some time.

edit:

so i'll judge him on that in the fall.   and unless he decides that grabbing political power is more important to him than doing his job, i won't need to evaluate him on that because we won't be having an election.  if there's an election before everyone in my extended family is vaccinated i'll know that he puts his ambition ahead of everything else, including my family's safety.

while yes, the task to vacinate every canadian by the end of september is a very daunting task, it should be noted that the current claim is 'with at least 1 dose\".  in other words, they aren't saying everyone will be fully vaccinated, but will have some level of protection.

now, they are assuming 26 million people will need to be vaccinated after april, and that moderna and pfizer are the only options in order for the following to be true:

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;all those reductions leave canada with about 26 million people waiting for their shots, and all of them will need two doses. if vaccine hesitancy shrinks considerably or new research makes the case for providing them to children that number will grow.

&amp;#x200b;

that would only be true if there wasn't johnson &amp; johnson.  and right now, there's no reason to assume that johnson and johnson won't be approved.  if johnson &amp; johnson is approved, that's 10 million less doses that need to be administered.  so that brings the total down to 42 million over 26 weeks, opposed to 52 million.  and lets assume say, 4 million are dosed in september, bringing their booster dates in october.  eliminate another 4 million.   that's now 38 million in 26 weeks.  that is equivalent to \\~1.4 million a week, or just over 200k vaccinations per day.  ontario alone, thinks it can vaccinate upwards of 150k/day, and frankly, just as the us who were originally targeting 1.5 million a day, i think these are low estimates that will be beat once supply is available.  yes, it's a daunting undertaking.  but if they get the supply, certainly not impossible.",liberals

different countries are in different situations and have varying degrees of difficulty at cutting emissions. developed countries can cut more easily than developing countries can, and countries where electricity production makes up most of their emissions can cut more easily (just switch from coal to gas/nuclear/a bit of renewables and you're done) than countries where oil production is the big culprit. and so on ...

according to this research, canada's fair share in order to reach a 2-degree global warming target, is a [38% emissions cut between 2005 and 2030](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/), whereas the us's fair share for the same target is a [52% emissions cut](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/), and the [uk](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/uk/) should be reaching net zero by the mid-2030s to have done an equivalent amount of effort. meanwhile, [china](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/) will have done its fair share if it has 2030 emissions which are 35% *higher* than 2005 (which would be a 20% cut from today).

if you buy this analysis, then canada/us/eu all announced comparable climate goals, right around the estimate for a 2-degree climate pathway; the uk's 78% cut between 1990 and 2035 is *not quite equivalent*, and japan's  climate goal (45% cut by 2030) is actually the weakest in the g7 - because as a wealthy country with a declining population and heavy reliance on coal power, emissions cuts *should* be easier in japan than pretty much anywhere else on earth.",liberals

gvgbd2u,2021-04-22T01:18:12.000-07:00,"quebec court decision on bill 21 poses a conundrum for justin trudeau i think that's a weak argument; the lack of a fine is to me a distinction without a major difference.  the restrictions applied to teachers in particular amount to a de facto profession ban, and if interpreted in that light the consequence strikes me as a quasi-criminal penalty.  from the perspective of those affected, being denied work in their chosen profession as the result of an arbitrary legal standard is as damaging as a fine.

imagine, for example, that the law had imposed provincial working standards generally, such that all work (in business over a certain size) was prohibited for those with the targeted manner of dress &amp;ndash; effectively replicating the province's language-of-work laws with respect to a dress code.  the only reasonable interpretation here would be that the provincial act denies meaningful work to a segment of the population based primarily on religious beliefs.  that total prohibition is effectively criminal in nature.

as further support for this view, note that the decision in *saumur v quebec (city)* did not hinge on the existence of the fine for the jehovah's witnesses; issuing fines was perfectly within the ordinary powers of the city.  instead, it was the _reason_ for the fine, here to suppress distribution of jehovah witness views.  the minimal reasoning given by kerwin held that the city's law violated a superceding quebec provincial guarantee of religious freedom, but the reasons of rand eloquently go further to state:

&gt;&gt; that legislation \"in relation\" to religion and its profes­sion is not a local or private matter would seem to me to be self-evident: the dimensions of this interest are nationwide; it is even today embodied in the highest level of the con­stitutionalism of great britain; it appertains to a boundless field of ideas, beliefs and faiths with the deepest roots and loyalties; a religious incident reverberates from one end of this country to the other, and there is nothing to which the \"body politic of the dominion\" is more sensitive.

1) weak international travel restrictions.
2) weak lockdowns for foreign travelers.  read up on australian quarantines done under military supervision.
3) delayed vaccine procurement strategy.  the stupid shit of partnering with china instead of just cutting cheques to pfizer and moderna.

ford:
1) refusing to keep schools closed.
2) lifting restrictions early.
3) refusing to impose any closures on large employers like amazon.
4) making a lockdown list so narrow that it had limited effect on case counts and healthcare workload.
5) not developing an effective vaccine distribution strategy despite knowing that vaccines were going to arrive for months.
6) not offering up paid sick leave for all the essential workers who were most exposed.
7) overreacting to modeling and going authoritarian with the police harassment.
8) politicized assistance, like refusing red cross workers while asking other provinces for nurses.

there's a reason ford is tanking in the polls while trudeau hasn't taken much of a hit.  the reality is that for all of trudeau's fuck ups, vaccines are going out the door now and several hundred thousand people a day are getting a jab in the arm.  with enough vaccines in the pipeline for almost every canadian adult to get two shots by canada day, he's going to look like the saviour of summer.

ford, on the other hand, did absolutely amazing in the begin.  he followed a lot of advice from experts and saved ontario from a bad first wave.  then realized this was going to take a long while and got bored.  couldn't resist a base who was screaming about restrictions and lockdowns.  by february he decided to bet it all on vaccines and ignore modeling, in a world where literally every country is competing for vaccines.  he gambled and lost badly.  and now the public is pissed.  just wait till the stories really start coming of the doctors choosing who to sacrifice at hospitals.

luckily for ford, 2022 is a long time away and voters have the memory of a goldfish.  also, ontarians like having opposites in federal and provincial governments.  so that should help him.",liberals

yeah sure, they don't lie, but, do you? i don't know where you're getting that info, as far as i'm concerned you could be taking it out of context or making it up as you go.

your initial post was already a swipe at me because i happen to like the liberal party. why should i trust anything you say?

&gt;your generation is 50% behind where they should be - it’s because of trudeau’s policies.

i already gave you a chance to explain that, you could not. your reasoning for this is to say that his qe strategy is what put us here. well, qe can do that, one of the downsides of it is that it can cause inflation. once again, they're passing a foreign owners tax. what does the cpc have that can alleviate this issue? the ndp has proposals, if i wanted to switch my vote to someone it'd be them, certainly not the cpc.

&gt;your counter to that is a strawman and partisan “everyone else would have done the same thing”.

i don't think you know what a strawman is. more than that, i fail to see how it is partisan to suggest that any party would have done the same. do you think the ndp and the cpc would have gladly presided over the worst economic crisis in canada and just let jobs and industries fall apart like nothing? they'd have lost the next election for sure with that strategy.

if anybody is being partisan here it's you. your criticisms of trudeau pretty much amount to \"trudeau bad\".

&gt;take a look at what happened in 2008, house prices dropped. the rich took a hit, so if you’re suggesting the cpc would have done “exactly” the same thing, well 10 years ago they didn’t and we didn’t have massive generational wealth gap because of it.

that's a different story that did not involve other industries like airlines falling apart. please, if you're going to tell me harper wasn't a spendthrift, you're kidding yourself. he worsened the deficit many times over. perhaps if he hadn't done, so canada could have more maneuvering room to spend like it did last year.

&gt;so if you’re set on trudeau, call your mp make sure they hear what your concerns are and how you’re going to be able to buy a house. effect change within the party to address the problems with the generational wealth gap.

see this is what i mean when i say i know what you're doing. this \"concerned citizen\" act is so two-faced and obvious that i wonder why you're even trying to do it at all. more than that, if this was really truthful you wouldn't have started off this comment chain with such an abrasive statement. do you feel some need to portray yourself as \"not supportive of the cpc\"? i'm less likely to trust you if you're not going to be straight with me. besides that who are you kidding?

these are political parties, yeah they want to do things, but it's not like they do it out of the goodness of their hearts. the cpc, the lpc and the ndp want my vote because it gets them into power, nothing else. since it is this way, they must earn it. i've given you plenty of chances to explain what your party can do for me, you can't give me straight answers. perhaps that's the conservative way though, feign interest in people's problems, lie through their teeth about it and then give no solutions.

thus far your answers can be summarized as:

1. i have this terrible alternative, but it is an alternative.
2. i don't know, there are no plans for that, trudeau doesn't like women.
3. you should vote for me, because your generation is behind, and i'm the only one saying that but i don't really know what i would do to fix it.

some ndp supporters have also told me that i should vote for them because \"they're the only party that has my future in mind\". it was every bit as condescending back then as it is now with you.

&gt; you solution is to add unnecessary inefficiencies to make an artificial product nature does better than humans? why?

the natural product comes from hydrocarbons which are currently locked away in geological formations.  when we extract them and then combust them they add to the co2 inventory in our atmosphere and oceans.  man made gasoline would use carbon already in our atmosphere.  i'm specifically thinking of the facility located just north of vancouver, somewhere along the sea to sky highway...squamish maybe?

&gt; you mean like this or this? you made the claim that the rest of the world has moved on and i don't see that anywhere in the data. explain.

i believe that i made the claim that the world intends to move on, has begun to move on, that these are early days and that we are at the beginning of a transition that will occur over a few decades.

&gt; to what end? your suggested alternatives here have very narrow growth potential. there really isn't anything to swing into, its more than likely we are going to ride out the momentum of our energy wealth and end up a poorer nation when its all said and done similar to central african nations re: rubber.

ahh, i see.  i actually agree that this is a very possible scenario.  i guess the difference between us is that i'm willing to see if we can swing into something somewhat related to what we already know how to do pretty well.  not everyone is going to be willing to do that.

&gt; climate change is not within canada's control and we benefit from it long term, all this effort to undermine our economy to influence a phenomenon we can't get our hands around is a wasted effort. we should be looking to monetize our wealth in the post-change world, maximizing the sale of our energy resources, our water resources and our food resources.

it is certainly correct that climate change is not (solely) within canada's control.

&gt; ghg fears is a bunch of handwaving to distract from the fundamental causes of climate change, namely that we don't need 7 billion humans to survive as a species.

ok.

fwiw, i would probably agree with the very last phrase of that statement, as it stands.  but what do i do with that?  are we actually going to advocate for depopulation as a solution - probably not.  i suppose one logical solution is to do little to nothing and just let the climate change as it will in response, and then deal with the consequences as they occur.  i guess i actually don't think that is an indefensible position, but it isn't the position i'm going to support.

&gt; the only paradigm shift i see is nuclear driven...

the landmark case was in 1974 where an act to reduce inflation was deemed acceptable because parliament implicitly declared inflation to be an emergency in the documents surrounding the bill. i think inflation is analogous in that it will always happen, but it was the out-of-control inflation that made it necessary for parliament to step in. the goal was to get inflation back to a sustainable level. and they did so with an act that had a termination date of three years.

so i suppose if the trudeau gov had said that the ggppa would run for five years (or some other limit, perhaps related to canada's obligations under the paris climate agreement) or maybe until a certain reduced threshold of emissions was reached, it would would be acceptable as emergency legislation. if it was \"until climate change ends\" then that's likely not going to cut it.",liberals

yes. that’s why we’ve established a point as country that respects the rights of every recognized person. maybe you think a fetus should be recognized as a person under law. that’s fine. it’s just not a popular opinion in canada to change our laws to reflect that. so it is bad political strategy in my opinion to advocate doing so.

&gt;this is just saying that it’s that way because it’s that way.

umm no. i’m saying that’s the way it is because we’ve decided as a democracy to recognize personhood at birth because it protects the fundamental rights of the mother, who is a recognized as person under society. it is unclear to a lot of people where personhood should begin, so we’ve chosen a point that protects the freedoms of all established members of society. is this like the 10th time i said this? again, you’re creating a straw man and declaring my beliefs to be something that they are not.

what’s so hard to understand for you that we just morally value different things? when personhood begins is up to each individual and we all have our own moral framework for deciding when personhood should begin. you see a fetus as a person so you are morally against abortion in certain situations. i morally value protecting the mother’s right to bodily autonomy under law rather than choosing to declare something as a person that many people think isn’t.",conservatives

again for heating, renewables do not work in the winter. solar can't produce enough, hydroelectric has issues with ice, wind cannot provide enough power.

we need oil and natural gas and pipelines are the safest method.

the replacement for this pipeline (which uses minimal fuel to transport) will be about 80 trucks per hours 24 hours a day 365 days a year. those have a bigger carbon footprint and are more likely to spill.

because we don't host the manufacturing facilities, so we are unable to use legal/regulatory actions to force fulfillment of our contracts (within deadlines) ahead of other such purchase agreements.

&gt; we signed a lot of contracts without delivery timing (or at least not so far as anyone can tell)

the current contracts appear to have timing-by-quarter.  this has been [confirmed](https://twitter.com/annieclairebo/status/1357371366526353409) for the pfizer and moderna contracts in particular.

&gt; they delayed approval of any new vaccine production in canada

looking at the timeline for the proposed novavax production facility, even if new production had been approved/funded in canada in the middle of last year for pfizer and/or moderna (which isn't guaranteed -- the lipid nanoparticle step seems to be difficult and may involve equipment that is independently in short supply), the facilities still would not have been online for significant q1 production.

biotech facilities are how we prepare for the next pandemic, not so much this one.

&gt; now, they could allocate more resources to vaccine approvals, and prioritize based on those firms that could commit dosage earlier.

you're begging the question that approval schedules are delayed because of resources.  if we're instead waiting for clinical trial data to come in, or for inspection reports of production facilities (responsible for a delay in the moderna vaccine) then no amount of health canada staffing can accelerate that.

remember that the oxford/az approval isn't without its problems elsewhere.  several european countries are recommending that shot only for the sub-65 population pending further study.  if the same recommendation were applied here, it would make the vaccine inapplicable to many of the priority groups targeted for q1 vaccination here.",liberals

that being said i agree compromises need to be made for a society, i just dont agree with where you choose to draw the line and quite frankly you have zero evidence to justify moving the line. you will most likely claim some bullshit about what has happened in another country with different laws completely then ours and neglect the fact that for the most part as in 99.9999% of the time work. as far as i am concerned canadian firearm owners have proven to be the most trustworthy of individuals whom commit the least crimes and if anything should have a real and fair discussion on common sense laws that base upon the action of a firearm and not what looks scary to fearmongers like you. i have tried to be syympathetic for your bad experiences but you seem to refuse to disengage from your losing arguements. 

an ar-15 is funtionally no different from hundreds of thousands of other firearms currently owned by canadians. i have 2 other magazine fed semi-automatic rifles locked up right beside my ar. these rifles are military surplus and have actually been made and issued to military forces and besides the magazines being pinned to 5 rounds have not been modified from then. meanwhile my ar was made exclusivly for the civilian market, has never been issued to a military force, and is completely unable to be modified to the specs of a military assault rifle. that is why the stupid made up term with no definition in canadian law assault style rifle which is bullshit as well. your gun control side has gaslighted and misled canadians at every turn and people like you eat it up as you are scared. the real issues will not be solved with this ban and nothing will change, just like with every other firearm ban. just ask the thousands of canadians who still own there fully automatic ak-47's, the fn-fals, there spas-12 shotguns that are all currently sitting still locked in safes from previous non-buy back bans that have proven that firearm owners and there legal firearms are not and have never been a big enough pronlem to warrent the bans. yes thousands if not tens of thousand fully automatic rifles are current in a bunch of old guys hands and have been for years, fully automatic assault rifles, and yet no real problems......",conservatives
