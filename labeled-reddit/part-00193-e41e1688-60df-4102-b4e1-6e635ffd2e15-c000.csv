saying you don't like something isn't refuting it. sorry!

&gt;its funny how you ignore the main point i made showing you that ayn rand and the atlas society both reject that she is in anyway a conservative

but they didn't, and i did address it. rand wasn't quoted in the article at all, so right off the bat you felt the need to lie to try to make your point. remember we discused that? and in fact the article didn't say she wasn't conservative, nor did it say she was a libertarian as you claimed.  it said most people consider her conservative but she does have some beliefs that aren't in line with the current (us) conservative dogma. 

to which i pointed out in detail that people aren't robots and politial beliefs aren't religion, and most people disagree with at least some element of the political party they identify with. which is true. you ignored that it would seem. 

&gt;says who?

anyone who knows anything about politics. there always has to be a frame of reference and context. for example some idiots might say \"liberals run deficits. harper ran deficits so he must have been a liberal\".  that would not take into account that he was in the worst recession in 80 years, ran some of the smallest per capita deficits in the civilized world, was forced to run more than he wanted by the opposiiton when he was in minority, and put forward a plan to end deficits which he achieved.from that context, things change. and it's pretty obvious that his budgets were pretty conservative especially when you look under the hood. 

context is critial. sorry - you definitely lost that :)

&gt;actually, it is

actually it isn't. market capitalists in the countries you mention differ quite a bit on implementation. there are wide differences about how much control the gov't should have in the market or should't have. russia likes a lot, and their market economists make that case, the us likes less, and the market economists argue back and forth about that, and canada tends to be somewhere in the middle. 

they argue over whether or not the market should be used for social issues - like banning abortion clinics or nazi t-shirts or whether the market should determine if those products are available. 

then there's trade, - holy shit you can't get republicans to agree on that at all, some are protectionist others are global marketists, etc.

so no. not even close. 

&gt;but it does mean that you follow the basic principles of being a conservative

no. it doesn't. it means that you may follow the majority of them. and that's how you see yourself, but it doesn't mean you even agree on what the \"basics\" are.

si quelqu'un est candidat pour un parti fédéraliste canadien, c'est parce qu'il veut faire parti d'un gouvernement, non? donc forcément, ce candidat penserait à sa formation politique comme \"nous\". forcément il penserait au gouvernement dont il fait parti comme \"nous\" si ce parti prend pouvoir. si il devient ministre, c'est pour avoir un portfolio gouvernemental, prendre le gouvernement en marche à son image. il va s'inclure dans le \"nous\" de son travail. s'il ne se voit pas parti de son équipe, qu'est-ce qu'il fait là?

tu ne trouverais pas ça ridicule qu'un ministre du gouvernement canadien en fonction militerait ouvertement pour la souveraineté du québec? c'est comme si un ministre d'un gouvernement péquiste militerait ouvertement pour le fédéralisme canadien. ça laisserait entendre qu'ils répudient leur project politique. 

peu importe si les partis et gouvernements canadiens ont des députés autrefois souverainistes ou souverainistes ouverts à une meilleure entente canada-québec. ça ne m'aurait rien fait de voir nantel comme ministre de culture, michel gauthier comme ministre au sein d'un gouvernement pcc ou hébert ministre de santé sous le plc. 

ce que je trouve illogique et que je ne veux pas voir c'est des gens qui ne croient pas du tout en quoi ils s'embarquent. des souverainistes au gouvernement fédéral ne croyant pas à la réforme, ça donne quoi? pourquoi vouloir représenter un pays dont tu veux quitter? 

&gt;tu ne trouves pas que tes positions sont un peu contradictoires ? d’un côté tu critiques l’existence d’un parti souverainiste à ottawa, et de l’autre tu ne veux pas que les souverainistes aillent dans les autres partis. tu ne peux pas avoir le beurre et l’argent du beurre.

non, pas du tout. voici mes positions. le bloc a un droit démocratique d'exister tant qu'une partie de la population lui donne suffisamment de votes et des sièges aux communes. tant qu'une partie non-marginale de la population voit en lui une utilité. mais personnellement j'aurai aimé que ce parti n'ait jamais vu le jour. qu'on ne sente pas l'utilité pour un tel parti. que les partis fédéralistes aient faite une meilleure job pour inclure les nationalistes - y compris ceux qui demeurent souverainistes aujourd'hui - à l'intérieur de leurs formations politiques à partir des années 60. 

je pense que les partis fédéralistes ont un devoir de rassembler et de créer une vision pan-canadienne prenant en compte la spécificité de toute nation et province au sein de la confédération. et je veux que les partis fédéralistes acceptent des membres et candidats souverainistes, avec la condition que les candidats embarquent de bonne foie et s'engagent à contribuer comme députés au bon fonctionnement du pays dont ils veulent gouverner. je ne veux pas avoir des ministres fédéraux prendre des actions résolument anti-canada au pouvoir. de la même manière que tu ne voudrais pas avoir des ministres québécois avec des actions résolument anti-québec. 

tout ce que je dis là est conséquent avec ce que j'ai répété à plusieurs reprises ici dans ce subreddit à travers les années. il n'y a rien de contradictoire dans mes positions. si certains éléments te rendent confus, dis le moi et j'élaborerai davantage. 

&gt;et le canada ne sera pas détruit si le québec part. c’est le deuxième argument fédéraliste le plus riducule après « les rocheuses ».

je faisais plutôt référence à la destruction du caucus gouvernemental. si un député ou ministre milite pour la sortie d'une bonne partie des sièges formant ce caucus (et c'est ce qu'il fait en militant activement pour la souveraineté), il milite pour la rupture du caucus auquel il appartient. c'est une évidence. 

mais peu importe, je suis d'accord avec l\"argument dont tu m'as attribué par erreur. les fédéralistes voient le départ du québec du canada comme les québécois verraient le départ de la gaspésie, montréal, ou la ville de québec du québec. oui techniquement, tu peux appeler ce qui en reste \"canada\" ou \"québec\" mais on s'entend qu'on y enlève ce qui a de plus fondamental. 

&gt;donc c’est « le fédéral », pas « notre gouvernement ». et pour les souverainiste c’est soit « le fédéral » ou « le gouvernement d’occupation ».

bon, si tu as lu jusque là, tu sauras que j'associais le \"nous\" aux membres du gouvernement canadien au pouvoir dans un contexte totalement hypothétique où un souverainiste militerait pour l'indépendance - se positionnant ainsi contre la gouvernance de son parti. pas à personne d'autre. pas aux souverainistes comme groupe. 

je suis cependant au courant des termes utilisés par les souverainistes. j'ai entendu ce genre de discours mille fois. en parlant de ridicule, les fédéralistes ne trouvent rien de plus ridicule que la vision du québec occupé par le canada. le québec reste de plein gré au canada. il n'est pas du tout opprimé. il exerce plein de pouvoir. il influence les élections fédérales. il influence les gouvernements fédéraux. c'est un délire de voir le québec comme étant occupé. si \"les rocheuses\" font rouler des yeux les souverainistes, il en est de même pour \"le québec occupé\" pour les fédéralistes. 

&gt;on ne me fera pas croire que le québec a déserté le npd pour sa position sur le niqab pour aller rejoindre un autre parti avec la même position.

pas pour la position, mais plus pour l\"ardeur avec laquelle mulcair s'acharnait là-dessus. quand j'étais encore membre du npd, on (députés, stratèges) m'a dit que les deux enjeux qui ont coulé le npd sont le déficit zéro et le niqab.  trudeau s'est prononcé contre le niqab, mais avec une manière plus...déviante. les électeurs les savaient tous les deux contre, mais trouvaient mulcair plus acharné. 
en tout cas, je suis d'accord qu'il y avait d'autres problèmes au npd par 2015.",liberals

one would think there's some bipartisan concern to be had with these portions of the population.

&gt; the liberals, not the ndp, are the urban party.  think of the new democratic party today, and you may conjure an image of a “downtowner” party rooted in the latte and laptop crowd. but this image is incorrect: the ndp has never been a distinctively urban party in canada.  this is because the party has continuously held seats in rural resource industry communities in places like northern ontario and the b.c. interior, balancing out its seats in large urban centres.

however the ndp has been losing ground in those old holds as well, and it's a wonder how jagmeet still evades calls to step down despite these ongoing losses.

&gt; history shows that change is possible. after decades of liberal dominance, john diefenbaker assembled a new majority coalition of conservative supporters in 1958 that differed from before. he combined rural prairie ridings that had previously supported the progressive conservative and social credit parties and rural québec ridings that traditionally voted liberal with new urban support in vancouver, winnipeg, toronto and montréal.  brian mulroney did the same in 1984. and not so long ago, stephen harper and jack layton managed to temporarily disrupt the trend toward the urban-rural polarization we identify — harper pushed into urban regions while layton had surprising victories in rural québec.

this is likely to happen again.  what coincided with these events was weak liberal leadership.  it's fairly easy for a conservative to come in when they run against a pitiful candidate, after the current liberal establishment was deemed too long in the tooth to continue by the populace.

so then the rural-urban divide is tossed on it's head.  at least temporarily.",liberals

also i think you're still downplaying laytons massive win in 2004, with a vote increase of almost 8%. you say that was only because of the sponsorship scandal, well why couldn't singh capitalize on snc lavalin or the lax/pseudo progressive policies of trudeau? layton got 8% because the sponsorship scandal but singh lost seats and the popular vote during snc?

idk seems like your downplaying laytons accomplishments. once again, singh's record of increases in the popular vote count by around 1% is not remotely impressive not to mention he lost the popular vote share in 2019 as well. 

also i see you are sticking to vote count and yet ignored layton's seat count gains. we are in a first past the post system, layton was gaining around 5 - 10 seats per election before 2011. singh lost half of his caucus in 2019 and in 2021 gained one seat. if you want to lead a party and be effective you have to play by the rules and singh has proven he is ineffective at achieving significant gains in both seat count or popular vote. 

i would probably need to see one more election to truly assess singh's leadership. 2019 was the continued collapse of the 2011 base that was probably going to happen anyway and 2021 was too close in proximity to really have given the ndp that much time to re group and become fresh to the electorate again.

only if the courts say that bill 21 is unconstitutional. if they don't, then i think most people will just consider it typical anglo whining and move on before the next election.  but if the courts get rid of it...that's a different story.  the whole appeal of canada to quebec federalists is that the quebec culture can preserved within the canadian context; if it turns out that the federal government is not only not helping to stop multiculturalism or preserve french, but actively stopping quebec from doing those things, then that's going to change a lot of minds in favour of sovereignty.

why? was your plan to make some kind of pact with the bloc?  on what terms?

edit: i should just add that with respect to the court challenge, they're (currently) mainly talking about whether the government can apply the bill 21 to english school boards, not any other government service (at least, that was the original ruling). with respect to that case, i'm not sure that will be enough to make separatism popular again, just because that's such a small proportion of total government employees.  

if you're talking about \"people who work for english school boards who wear a hijab,\" we're talking about likely less than 100 people, who work for schools that only serve about 8% of the population.  i think you would need something much bigger (like the whole law being overturned) for separatism to be popular in a serious way again.  i don't think the courts are that insane (yet), but maybe i'm wrong and the trudeau appointees will actually do something that stupid.",liberals

part of the challenge is that too many of the discussion areas are controlled by those with anti-conservative bias. with reddit in mind, look at the user flairs of the moderators of /r/canadapolitics/ - i mean they don't even try to hide it. they can deny it all they want, but they undoubtedly have a huge bias in their moderation against conservatives, which was a large reason i ended up starting this subreddit. 

unfortunately tech companies themselves slant this way as well, which means in order to participate, we have to hold ourselves to a higher standard. it's annoying and unfortunate, but it's the reality.

the good part is, a lot of conservative ideas are good ideas. there's just a struggle in right-wing circles in marketing their ideas to voters. i think grass roots is the only way to tackle this.

my best suggestion i could make is: become an expert on the topics you are passionate about. win the arguments with sound logic and principles against people who don't know what they are talking about. win the moral arguments. financially support organizations that do work you like. cut your financial contributions to organizations and companies who do things you hate. money can make a huge difference.",conservatives

h9n4336,2021-08-19T19:21:54.000-07:00,"why haven’t the liberals released their election platform? they’re still working on it that's incorrect. environment canada posts ghg emissions on a two year lag so we only have data from 2019. according to environment canada:

\"canada's total ghg emissions in 2019 were 730 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (mt co2 eq), a slight increase from 728 mt co2 eq in 2018\"

considering the canadian economy grew by 1.7% and the canadian population grew by 1.4% that's a reduction in both per capita emissions and emissions per dollar of gdp. in addition to emissions overall being more statistically stagnant than anything. 

you're also ignoring the fact that that was only the first year of the carbon tax, a policy that is already scheduled to increase heavily (up to 170$ per ton by 2030, source in last comment) as well as the fact that the federal carbon tax was not in effect during 2019 in alberta as the ucp repealed the ndp provincial one in may 2019 and did not replace it. 

that means the heaviest emitting province in the country was without a consumer carbon tax for the bulk of the year. as a result it is not surprising emissions went up slightly and id be curious how you propose that's the liberals fault? considering the effects of the carbon tax and the pandemic i do not think it is ridiculous of me to assert that canada's overall emissions lowered drastically in 2020 and while there will probably be an increase in 2021 over 2020, i imagine it will remain below 2019 levels, though that is an educated guess that i'd be happy to admit is wrong if higher emissions come to pass. 


i'm also gonna say that your comment i replied to asserted that the liberals didn't do anything groundbreaking with their climate policy (first party to push for and implement a carbon tax at the federal level is by definition groundbreaking), how they bought a pipeline (a move not made for climate reasons but one whose negative effects are vastly outweighed by the carbon tax and other gov climate policies), and how they shouldn't be believed because the make empty promises (which i have shown with sources and evidence is factually not the case, they absolutely followed through on what they promised and in fact exceeded it.) 

now if you want to say the promises are inadequate based on current science related to climate change and fall short of the 1.5°c paris goals, i can acknowledge that, but that is not how your initial comment was framed and you then have to recognize that the ndp's climate goals were similarly inadequate in the 2019 election.

these specific identities should live on their own terms, not be grouped together into an over-broad mishmash of \"left.\"          
         
as the conservatives have demonstrated through numerous mergers: basing a party's identity on nothing more specific than the general area they land on a unidimensional political spectrum is a recipe for a party that is poorly equipped to deal with nuance, because their party members' only agree at a non-nuanced level.         
       
not to mention that these parties typically need to overjustify their existence as a way to counterbalance their inner differences, which inevitably plays out via pro-polarization rhetoric that is rooted in portraying the party having as little common ground as is possible to get away with when discussing their relationship to the opposition.    
    
this again can be visualized by the conservatives, who have the lowest ability to recruit swing voters out of any party because their internal cohesion has relied on othering the libs and ndp as much as possible and using toxic language like \"take back our country\".

h5or5hc,2021-07-18T08:52:53.000-07:00,"eric grenier : why erin o'toole's best pm numbers are a problem i must say o'toole has only himself to blame. 

o'toole learned first hand from scheer how far right harper had left the party with his \"old stock/barbaric practices\" campaign that attracted and installed the far right and the prejudice  as the majority in the cpc. so o'toole made a sharp right in the cpc leadership race to attract and outflank mckay, promising to be the socon and far right standard bearer.

o'toole has only placated them in actual policy initiatives, so it falls on death ears when he says he's not as far right socially himself. 

but with the conservatives shocking vote \"no\" on the question \"is climate change real\", and 52 mp's voting against the gay conversion bill, let alone the cpc's terrible history on indigenous issues, the cpc far right are now out of control and are dictating what party looks like to the rest of canada - no matter how much o'toole tries to deny they are. this is why harper muzzled his mps, but that cat is out of the bag now, and will never go back in.

canadians will accept many things in politics, but being prejudice and racist is not one of them, especially when it seems to happen over and over with the cpc. yes, that will attract a certain type of bigoted voter, but canada isn't the us and millions of socially progressive, economically conservative people will vote hard against you.  it is still shocking the cpc hasn't figured that out yet in 2021. at 14%, o'toole might have to go right again to keep his party members happy and avoid a real revolt, and stave off a rush to the ppc or maverick party. so there's a real possibility this is going to get far worse.

all you have to do is look how voters ran away from kim campbell when her campaign team made fun of chretien's face and his polio disability. the cpc has somehow become know as more prejudice and bigoted than that. and once neighbours, especially in ontario, the maritimes, and coastal bc start talking to each other, you will not be wanting to identify as a cpc voter in key swing areas. that's a huge part of politics in those areas.

this could get really ugly as negative momentum can destroy a party in canada. again, look at what happened to kim campbell. if o'toole tries at all to go left, there will be a mutiny now, and ppc could gain millions of votes, like what like reform did to the pcs. or they'll just stay home.

o'toole has painted himself into his own corner here by over promising to the far right, and there's almost nothing he can do about it now.",conservatives
