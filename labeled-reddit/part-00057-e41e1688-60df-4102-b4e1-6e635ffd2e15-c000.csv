if your goal is to make the story public, then a criminal investigation hinders that aim.

many administrative commissions can be issued subpoena power, investigate documents, and seize physical evidence.  

however, once you attach criminal liability to this process, everyone who can possibly be charged gains the constitutional right against self-incrimination.  criminal investigations _cannot_ compel testimony from potential suspects, and this is directly at odds with \"making the story public.\"",liberals

i think it's also important to remember that if these are investigations it would not necessarily be oh you worked here, life in prison or something insane. it would be case by case.

to have people who were involved and leading these activities still around sends a message that many canadians still hold, that this was fine.

let's talk about real life shall we?  china is trying to forcefully take taiwan, and is committing a genocide.  usa is sending missiles to syria to support an endless war, and farmers in india are being severely mistreated.

you know those three countries i mentioned?  they are the biggest contributors to climate change, and do very little to change their policies, or create hypocritical ones (signing the paris agreement while bombing the middle east).

real life takes into account what is happening everywhere as it does have an effect on is.  why do you think people around the world emigrate into canada? there are many reasons, and war is a popular one.

canada already has an effective climate plan in place especially when compared to many other countries with very few policies at all.

the evangelical movement had been politically frustrated for some time. when the cpc was formed, the culture wars of the '80s were still fresh in the minds of many. evangelicalism was better organized and more willing to become involved in politics. for many evangelicals, harper was their chance to redress 30 years of societal decay.

while they did get some things - the cpc climate change policies, unconditional support of israel - they didn't get the ones that held more visceral importance.

my feeling is that these supporters have become impatient. they've been fighting these issues for almost a generation, and the one canadian prime minister that they hoped would come through for them, didn't - at least not enough. now they're demanding more vocal support and more real policy change. o'toole has no credibility with these supporters. he is not a true believer willing to spend political capital on issues they care about. it doesn't help that he's roman catholic.

in short, i don't think it's so much about respecting the party leader as whether or not social conservatives believe the party leader will put their desired policy goals at the forefront of their politics. o'toole doesn't have the right credentials out of the box.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meng\\_wanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meng_wanzhou)

it is exactly her defense:

## allegations of unlawful detention

&gt;meng's  defence team alleged that the process of detention of meng wanzhou was  an unlawful conspiracy between the two agencies. her defence team  **claimed that the** [**rcmp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rcmp) **and cbsa colluded to detain her under an** [**immigration check**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/border_control)  without immediately informing her of her arrest, and subsequently  arresting her three hours later, which amounted to a conspiracy. the  defence claimed this manner of arrest was unlawful as the warrant called  for her immediate arrest, and had violated [section 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_10_of_the_canadian_charter_of_rights_and_freedoms)  of the charter requiring meng to be immediately informed of her charges  upon arrest. the defence argues that questions asked during the three  hour period, which included her business dealings with iran, and the  cbsa officers omitting to take notes during certain sections of the  questioning are evidence of a conspiracy and an unlawful arrest.[\\[53\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meng_wanzhou#cite_note-53)   the crown attorney responded that there was nothing unlawful or  sinister about the customs detention for questioning and subsequent  formal arrest, and that this process did not violate section 10 rules.[\\[54\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meng_wanzhou#cite_note-54)

the immigration check was done after meng was forcefully removed from the international zone.  an international zone is a type of [extraterritorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extraterritoriality) area not fully subject to any country’s border control policies.

if that's news to you, it's because the canadian press does such a piss poor job of explaining the technicalities of why she will eventually be released.

trump didn't refuse to transfer power, he attempted what is in essence a coup. he has no choice but to give up power under the current laws, and those laws have held and he's done. what he tried to do is set the laws aside and corruptly take power. and again - that's got little to do with being a populist, we've seen coups from all sorts of types before. 

\\&gt; and trudeau is a populist with a radical fervent base. he penalizes  those who do not support him even personally. and his base  being  populist is deranged to the the point of devaluing the humanity of  others or gaslighting horrible actual decisions trudeau has made.

if you're trying to undermine the liberals it's probably better to connect with concrete ways the liberals were failing to help despite caring. casting the liberals as having ineffective policy is how you appeal to people who previously voted for trudeau because they're looking for a caring leader, and you can sublimate that feeling to jagmeet's equally strong brand there. \"caring is important, but so is execution\". 

plus the ndp's weakness is their perception of execution so working on building up that image is what you need to break into the mainstream skeptics. running on \"we're the only ones who cares\" just falls back to \"ndp: principled but maybe the execution isn't there?\" brand.",liberals

fast-tracking bills in the senate usually requires the leaders of all the groups in the senate to agree on a schedule. if there isn’t a will to prioritize a bill (eg c-10), then it will go through the usual process. so even if they get it sent from the house on monday, second reading is likely on tuesday, and a second reading vote prior to the summer break is very unlikely.

i personally believe a fetus should not be considered a legal person under law until it is no longer biologically dependant on the life of its biological mother to sustain itself (once it is out of the womb and the umbilical cord is cut). i believe up until that point, the fetus is just a part of the mother’s body. 

i’m sure there are many many people who believe abortion to be immoral after the first trimester. that is fine, they don’t have to have one after the first trimester. and indeed, 90% of abortions performed in canada occur before the first trimester. however, canadians seem to think giving women total freedom to choose is legally the way to go even though they may disagree morally. most people do not believe that their own personal morals on this issue should be imposed on the rest of society.",conservatives

in the past when i’d be called to ask to vote for policy to move forward to convention the callers pushing socon policy had tps that were what you’d expect — that it’s the right thing to do, that it would be doing right by god, etc. — which i actually agree with (i’m personally pro-life but it’s just an issue that isn’t high on my list of priorities so i’m ambivalent towards it).

this year though? some of the calls were downright qanon. people asking me to vote to delete 70 because it’s the only way to take back our party from the socialists, that o’toole was sent by the devil to destroy our party, that o’toole was a liberal plant. it left me feeling incredibly dejected.

not to mention groups like clc are becoming increasingly hostile the party and telling their members that the devil is influencing the moderates in the party. (that’s one of the reasons i like the rightnow guys a lot more — they’re far more sensible... even if i thought their impassioned defence of sloan was incredibly misplaced).

to me the key reason for banning the ar-15 and equivalents - semi-auto, centrefire, box-fed - is its sheer effectiveness in killing a large number of people in a short time, as demonstrated in mass shootings (and action movies *). mass shootings are rare, but risk = probability x impact.

i don't want the police to get into an arms race with the civilian population. apparently front-line police are now being equipped with their own equivalent, the c8; i would have expected that this is more appropriate for swat teams.

i don't expect this would have much effect on handgun violence, which is a separate problem.

reloading a firearm of any kind takes seconds, i dont know why people are so hung up on this. you're essentially saying we should ban all semi autos because they shoot faster. the reality is a mass shooter could kill just as many people with an [old world war 2 bolt action rifle](https://youtu.be/apnot0skpmy). the shooting isn't going to stop until thr police stop it, and as proven by the shooting in nova scotia, the rcmp is an inadequate force at stopping these sort of events

our eda was asked to recommend a proposition that was a bit.... broad? it started about religious freedom (i fully support), then it went about religious facilities abilities to reject hosting events that are not aligned with their belief (fully support but this is separate from the first), then about religious organisations can have hiring process that otherwise would have been in contravention of the charter of rights (i kinda support it in general since to be a catholic priest, for example, you have to be a catholic and a man, which can be considered discriminatory; but this may be abused a bit too far), and it ends with there should be no restrictions on religious gatherings (which i have issue with because it may be necessary in pandemic situations like this past year).  
as you can see, it has 4 different things that are remotely related to each other, but not really should be under the same proposition.  

i think i have to clarify that socon =/= alt/far right or qanon, though there may be (not few) overlaps between the two groups. but qanon conspiracy is nowhere similar with pro-life belief for example. i honestly laughed the first time i heard the pizzagate theory and thought that's a satire from somewhere and still can't understand why there can be anyone who believe them; but a surprising amount of people do, and unfortunately quite noticeable part of them are socially conservative at the same time.  

i agree that clc is more batshit than right now, with the latter being more respectful and realistic in their demands.

1) between 9,700 and 11,000 ahs employees will be laid off, most of whom work in laboratory, linen, cleaning and in-patient food services.
in this space, there is massive cost overruns, inefficiencies, and huge investments needed. it absolutely is in dire need of companies who specialize in infection control, scrubs, and linen who can improve on the horrific processes in play at ahs. good on ahs for realizing that their current in-house laundry and scrub program is a disaster and that managing it internally was a complete failure from an ipac and cost standpoint. 

lab services are also vastly expensive and the companies that bid on this have provided significant opportunities to help ahs, and to offer significant savings. 

2) have you read the ey report?

very informative and well argued. 

the message that these studies create is consistent and clear: canada’s high rate of spending on health does not correlate with higher relative performance on key international measures. this creates questions around how health care dollars are spent, the distribution of these dollars across the health system and how provinces and individual health organizations like health authorities or hospitals use funding as an incentive for achieving high quality patient outcomes.
albertans can be justifiably proud of the provincial health system. it offers world class care to albertans located across the province, but there is clearly an opportunity to improve the quality and affordability of our health care. our report, and the direction we have been given by the government, is not about spending less. it is about getting value for what albertans spend and doing more with the money that exists in the system.

why argue about which 2.5% of the population got a dose instead of arguing about why we're 20th in vaccination in the world? ([or less, depending which measure you use](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)) we committed to the most doses per capita, we're spending a buttload, yet our procurement is still lacking.

also.  as somebody that spent a little while working and parenting as a low income earner myself, i can speak to my experience of having to juggle my kid between friends, family, neighours, occasionally people i barely knew.  i would cycle between them based on how much nerve i had in asking them again to take my kid for half a day.  towards the end i managed to find an under-the-table home daycare, which worked out well for us but it was a risk.  and because it was under-the-table it meant i couldn't claim back anything at tax return time, although it was cheaper than official daycare of course.  this is all because i couldn't afford daycare and the deposit for it, up front.  had there even been a daycare space at $30-40 a day instead of $70-80 a day, i would have really appreciated that, and made it work, even if it was just a couple days a week.  so the idea of $10 a day universal childcare is actually quite overwhelmingly heartwarming to me.

(the other thing i found when i was looking at official daycare options was that there was such a huge variety in quality.  i remember going to look at a couple of centres in my neighbourhood in toronto and being glad to walk away again, so miserable was the experience.  there i was, unable to really afford even a shitty daycare, but also glad that i didn't have to put my kid in there.  there's a whole bracket of people for whom it's not a choice).",conservatives

&gt;so, a little under two years from when the pandemic hit us, sounds about right. presumably you think that the idea only occurred a few weeks ago?

yes, the government was fairly clear throughout the pandemic in thinking it didn't need domestic capacity, until it suddenly changed its mind a couple of months ago. 

&gt;“the harper government, however, drastically cut funding to research councils, which in turn gave out fewer and smaller grants to support graduate students and post-graduate fellows with heads full of knowledge and a drive to discover.”

&gt;“that’s why canada does not have a major pharmaceutical company developing a vaccine to fight covid-19. we could have if we had chosen to fund those people who spend so many hours at a time in their lab that they don’t know if it’s day or night. we could have if we had spent more on spectroscopes and supercomputers that let those people know what is happening when certain molecules are forced together.”

this isn't why, and nobody with any actual knowledge suggests that's why. an opinion piece by a retired professor with no actual experience in pharmaceuticals and an axe to grind doesn't change that. the opinion piece is trash, too, because it doesn't even point to any causality. the assertion is essentially that some grad student would have (1) started a global pharmaceutical company that (2) also produced vaccines, and (3) that said person would choose to start the company in canada for... (4) reasons... and (5) they might have invented the vaccine (6) before the pharmaceutical giants that have done so already. it's beyond speculative.",liberals

gmiymlk,2021-02-07T08:09:13.000-08:00,"canada might have too much party discipline, but that's at least better than too little stability also means other kinds of policies. we had a province in 1995 that was less than a percent away in the vote from having a majority wanting independence. provinces fight each other in other ways too, like alberta and british columbia having a trade war despite being controlled by the same party in 2018. that's not a harbinger of stability. the feds change a lot of policies by executive decree and without the support of parties that actually make up a majority of the vote in most cases, not since 1984 has any federal government ever had a majority of the votes. if these policies change every 4 years, potentially even less, then you decrease investor confidence, you decrease the certainty people have in wanting a child knowing that you will be supported for all 18 years of their minority and years after in university, and cities can't develop infrastructure as well because they don't know whether grants will change or not. 

i personally know this story. the provincial government in alberta massively changed provincial funding for railway systems in cities, in edmonton and calgary. my city was just about to proceed with a line they had been planning for years and negotiating with everyone to get somewhere and the provincial government was very close to cancelling the policy before last minute begging stopped them from doing that. 

ontario cancelled a ubi program, cut toronto's city council in half right before a city election, and blocked a city from using the electoral system their own people wanted after it had just adopted it. 

these have real impacts on the people who were there and the ability of people to predict the future of so many long term projects, and we are in a state of humanity where we need this kind of confidence, such as addressing long term climate change. the biggest projects like cures for the heart and stroke diseases that kill so many people every year need this long term thinking and long term funding grants, and government policies being based on the potential to switch parties and exclude everyone else so radically every 4 years is not helping you or us.

proportional parliaments normally need at least some of the parties which agreed to the choice of policy to agree to it afterwards as they are probably still reasonably popular even if they had a slight downturn. to survive on any given policy decision, a government would have to assemble the people who constituted a majority of the votes or were elected by a majority to agree, and that majority of voters probably still has people among them who support the policy decision, and that is probably going to be true after an election. but if governments can get elected with only a third of the votes actually going to them, or a majority of seats with only 39% of the votes, the odds are much lower that on any decision, the majority of people agrees with it and some of those who had to be involved with the decision at the time will continue to be involved after the election.

and just because we are better than many other places, doesn't mean we can't improve on it. 

as for the 10 dollar words, the prime minister in many other countries with more proportional systems do not have these kinds of powers. they usually can't prorogue parliament, often with these legislatures themselves needing to consent or the coalition government needing to collectively ask for the proroguing. and they are usually forbidden from doing so when the opposition is realistically considering motions of no confidence. they are usually even less able to ask for a new election, with it often being the case that the opposition must expressly say they have no confidence before doing so, or failing a specific budget vote on the general budget, not just an opposition amendment or a kind of financial bill but which is not the general budget, or ask for parliamentary consent to hold a general election as is the case with german landtage of the federated states. they can't just call an election because they feel like it. and even if they get an election, they know that it's basically impossible to get a majority government and you don't gamble on the chance of having one when your polling numbers could easily go down too and you end up with a worse bargaining position after. 

as for getting fewer seats while winning more votes, you fully know well that alternatives to that exist and you know what they are called. and you oppose the idea that bc would introduce proportional representation based on 40% of those voting for it in the referendum. but that's more than most governments in recent history in canada get, why would you accept the will of the minority of people having a majority government if you want the will of a majority in a referendum to be respected? 

in new brunswick, still 40% of people didn't vote for that particular government. where are their voices to represent them? who is the leader of the opposition? who stands for when cross party cooperation is supposed to be required anyway to choose independent people such as the auditor general? 

i chose germany for that example because of important similarities to canada. it became a single country in almost the same year we did, 1871 to 1867. it is a federal union, and has always been so except for the years of nazi rule. it's always had many parties except during those nazi years. and it has a strong and solidified system of political parties like canada, where italy has a lot more cliques. germany was also less corrupt through all the years than italy, and is closer to canada on the corruption index than places like italy or belgium.

as for the 2005 referendum, you can't ignore that people detest politicians and don't like things associated with them, and that their moves are usually seen as machiavellian, but when you take a representative sample of people as the 2005 assembly did, to study it without party discipline, people can come to far more consensus than they can in a plurality based parliament. and if majority rules, then the 57% result should have resulted in bc using single transferable vote until at least 2009, but they were denied the opportunity to ever use it because the fucking liberal party in that province arbitrarily imposed a supermajority which is never imposed for anything else, not even the most fundamental ideas of our democracy like the charter of rights and freedoms and how much of the popular vote it got (0%) and is 20% more of the popular vote than is imposed for any government, and is 27% more than the incumbent government got in federal parliament today.",liberals

hb20fta,2021-08-30T23:36:43.000-07:00,"the poll thread - tuesday, august 31, 2021 realistically, barring a total liberal collapse, i'd imagine the conservatives are looking at these ridings:

**2019 results - nova scotia**

*cape breton—canso:*  (l:  38.5%)  (c:  34.6%)  (3.9%)

*cumberland—colchester:*  (l: 36.7%)  (c:  35.7%)  (2.0%)

*sydney—victoria:*  (l:  30.9%)  (c:  27.7%)  (3.2%)

these seats only require a 2% swing from liberal to conservative to switch.  realistically, i can't see the conservatives doing better than that.  with a 6% swing they could potentially pick up south shore—st. margarets, but beyond that they'd need an 8-10% swing for them to reliably pick up additional seats. 

**pei:**

*egmont:*  (l:  39.7%)  (con:  34.4%)  (5.3%)

gail shea's old riding is probably their only potential pickup, similar to nova scotia you'd need an 8-10% liberal to conservative swing to put two of the other three seats into play.

**new brunswick**

*fredericton:*  (g: 33.7%)  (c:  30.4%)  (3.3%)

*miramichi—grand lake:*  (l: 36.8%)  (c:  35.7%)  (1.1%)

*saint john—rothesay:*  (l: 37.4%)  (c: 34.0%)  (3.4%)

again, same story as the rest of the maritimes, a ~10% swing from liberal to conservative would be required to see further gains.  fredericton is going to be interesting, since atwin's switch from green to liberal means her odds are probably better than the 2019 results would indicate, but voters don't always support party switchers so it's hard to say for sure.

**newfoundland:**

*bonavista—burin—trinity:*  (l: 45.7%)  (c:  39.5%)  (6.2%)

to pick up further seats, a 6-8% swing from liberal to conservative could theoretically nab the avalon &amp; labrador seats, but it would be an even greater uphill battle past that.

if the conservatives were to pick up all of the above seats where they have a reasonable shot at, that's still only 8 seats.  if the rest of the country stayed roughly the same, you'd need a ~8-10% l =&gt; c swing across the board in the maritimes &amp; newfoundland for the conservatives to have a shot at nabbing even a plurality of seats, and at this point in the campaign i'm having a hard time seeing that happen, barring a complete liberal collapse like 2011.",conservatives

trudeau did the tva debate in 2019 while snubbing the maclean's and munk debates. i'm still salty about that, because it basically means quebec gets two debates while roc gets one. let's not kid ourselves here, the commission's french debate is totally a quebec focused debate, even if it's ostensibly meant for the entire country.",liberals

&gt; **this is something that can be put in place now…** i implore all members of parliament, each of whom has access to excellent health care and dental care benefits through the house of commons, to vote in favour of this motion.

is technically true, but hasty and inviting failure.

we could implement a federal dental care or pharmacare program tomorrow. we could try to incentivize, bribe, or outright coerce the provinces into accepting it. doing so would undoubtedly erode our federalism, push us closer to a unitary state, and the provinces are under no constitutional obligation to accept the transfer payments or spend them in the way the program demands. 

for any of these reasons, the program can fail or at least could be seen as a failure. to which, is it worth the gamble to be hasty? if the program fails, how long will it be before the general public has an appetite to try it again? 20 years? 30 years?

i'm not saying don't try to implement a federal dental care program. what i'm saying is that doing it in a manner that respects our political institutions takes longer, but is worthwhile if it means the program is more likely to survive in the long term.

yes, we could help a lot of people *today* by implementing such a program with haste. however, if the program collapses immediately, then not only do we lose it tomorrow, but generations of people afterwards might not get any help either.

our health care system was not an overnight experiment, despite what many here seem to believe. to get from the initial pilot programs that provinces conducted to the canada health act was over a 30 year journey. it took time for it to become entrenched in our political institutions. that's why it is strong. it was normalized, and people were ready to accept it because they already expected it.",liberals

quebecer conservatives are primarily cultural ones, and economic conservatives are rather rare. true libertarians, in the right-wing sense, are rare, which is why the current conservative party of québec is truly marginal and never had a single mna. since economic conservatism is hopeless in québec politics, the only moment when economic conservatives in québec vote in that direction is in federal elections because they are too marginal to matter inside québec's own political game, so they vote for a foreign party that couldn't ever win in québec. normal quebecer conservatives, the cultural ones, would probably agree with a lot of the ndp's economics and would probably agree with the green when it comes to at least mild ecological measures (so long it doesn't disturb the circulation of cars too much). but they don't vote ndp because obviously they are not culturally conservative. they desert parties as soon as they smell woke politics imported from the us.

canadian conservatives are economical conservatives first, and they are deeply involved in alberta's peculiar institution of oil sands, that just like us fire eaters, try to argue that it's not a shameful \"necessary evil\" but a \"positive good\". québec has no stakes in oil production at all, so it can be as ecologist as it wants without ever suffering from it in any way. moreover, albertan agitators are the ones that are always badmouthing québec with their idiotic equalization rant all the time (which demonstrate they don't understand how it works, not to mention it's part of a constitution québec rejected ironically). they also tend to mimic us republicans, which are loathed in québec as well. québec never, never sides with whoever is obviously hating it. it won't stand in the same party as albertan fire eaters, ever, and it doesn't care wether the peculiar institution dies or not. 

it's simply impossible to make the federal conservatives matter in québec. the cultural gap is irreconciliable. o'toole is on to something when he focuses on the cultural angle when he does speeches in french but his party structurally is doomed to fail anyways.",conservatives

it's a movement of people in ethno-cultural groups which were historically privileged or favoured in society, and their grievance is that they're afraid of permanently losing said privileges. in the usa, the main dimensions of this are white vs. non-white, christian vs. non-christian, rural vs. urban; the former being anxious about the demographic growth of the latter, and whether that could be an existential threat to their \"way of life\" and \"heritage\". (in its canadian forms, right-wing populism is more centred around oil extraction and the singular importance of that industry to certain parts of canada, and the existential threat being feared is that climate action will kill the industry)

the supporters of trump aren't so much angry at the status quo, as they are *pleased* with an old status quo and angry that it's being dismantled, and they're desperate to rebuild or at least preserve what's left of it because it's gone forever. the issues they're passionate about aren't taxing the rich, but stopping immigration, projecting a nationalistic pride in their country, preserving an idealized \"traditional\" or \"rural\" way of life with firearms, the trappings of religion, a race hierarchy, and so on.
