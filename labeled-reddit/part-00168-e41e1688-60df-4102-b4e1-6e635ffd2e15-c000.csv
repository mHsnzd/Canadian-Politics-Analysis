the current constitution seems to prevents parliament from putting limits on the prime minister's power to advise the sovereign. while the uk can bring in a fixed term parliament act with teeth, we can't. the current constitution has brought in an unwinnable situation on indigenous relations that needs constant intervention of the courts to figure out anything. the current constitution has entrenched a poor division of powers between the federal and provincial governments. the current constitution has a complex amending formula that puts provincial politicians in charge rather than a simple referendum requirement.

back in 1982, the only thing that was required was rubber stamp approval from the british parliament to amend the constitution. with that kind of flexibility, we should've really chosen a simple amending process at the very least even if the provinces were displeased with it.",liberals

hnzr5w4,2021-12-09T22:56:32.000-08:00,"doug ford looks poised to win next year’s election. here’s how he reversed his political fortunes one reason is that covid restrictions affect certain groups disproportionately more than others, and progressives are at least ostensibly opposed to rules that do such things. for example, vaccine passports certainly have restricted the freedom of movement of minorities more than whites. in new york (and i apologize that this is us data, but i couldn't find canadian data quickly), only 28% of blacks 18-44 are vaccinated, meaning the passports they have there (less restrictive than ours however) disproportionately affect blacks. source: [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/nyregion/covid-vaccine-black-young-new-yorkers.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/nyregion/covid-vaccine-black-young-new-yorkers.html).  


in addition, progressives usually point out that the rich can usually get around restrictions with no consequence, as we can see with some of doug ford's parties and the recent party that happened at 10 downing in england. there's also the people getting fired as things like nurses and teachers for not getting vaccinated. and progressives seem to generally support firing these working-class people for that, while conservatives are defending them. totally inverted from the normal. and i mean since you brought up abortion...which side usually says \"my body, my choice?\"  


the main point is that conservatives in general usually defend the hierarchy and rule of law against threats to order, which covid certainly is, while progressives usually defend the rights of the poor, downtrodden, and the different against the crushing power of the state. but since covid, conservatives have been defending these people (if indirectly) while progressives seem to be cheering on the state as it steamrolls the poor. you have to be able to point out how many poor people struggled due to covid restrictions while the rich have often come out better...mainly due in my opinion to unnecessary restrictions supported by progressives. totally inverted.",conservatives

according to academic research (e.g. adrian zenz) and first-hand testimony from escaped detainees, china has thrown approximately 1 million uighur people into prison camps, where they are \"educated\" in pro-ccp propaganda and in which they are banned from practicing their muslim faith on pain of severe punishments including torture. some detainees undergo forced labour. even outside the camps, many uighur women are forced to be sterilized or have abortions. the intent of the policy is to decrease the number of muslim uighurs in china in order to prevent them from becoming a source of resistance against the chinese government. there is intent to gradually erase a culture, and they're ok with cruelty, but no intent to outright kill them en masse holocaust-style.

however, after he lost the leadership election to scheer, bernier seems to have drunk all the populist kool-aid and gone full fringe. his campaign moved away the positions that could entice more moderate voters and towards significant reductions in immigration, attacks on multiculturalism, strong opposition to the carbon tax &amp; climate science and attacking andrew scheer as liberal-lite while portraying himself as the \"true conservative\" candidate. after the fact, it's not really surprising that the ppc got less than 2% of the vote last election.  if bernier wanted the ppc to be viable, it should have been designed as a centre-right party to attract disenfranchised voters away from the lpc and cpc, but instead bernier narrowed its base so that even the cpc elements that agreed with him refused to support him in fear of a  vote split.

his own hubris and ideological zeal snubbed his chance to be in any way relevant or productive in canadian politics to the point that he's even degraded himself into complete tin-foil hat territory.  i don't think i've seen anyone regress from top leadership prospect to irrelevant fringe candidate as quickly as bernier has over the past 3-4 years.",conservatives

i believe this personally because the only solved cases are ones by serial killers from america and the bc rcmp is notoriously difficult on this issue. they rarely make statements they avoid all interviews they close cases as much as possible and i personally know people who go in to report their missing sister or friend and the cops say they are probably on a bender and they should just wait.

the federal government doesn’t want to reveal a massive hit to the public trust in an already controversial rcmp. there is a degree of it that is valid insofar as it’s hard to solve a lot of these murders in a vast and horrifyingly dense rainforest but there is also a degree where there is corruption and an exploitative justice system.

think about how someone would run for gg against other candidates. would the boring person who promises to be as dignified and regal and lots of ribbons win? or would the activist who courts specific voting blocs take it? what of quebec separatism, if an activist gg were also a separatist and held up every bill until quebec separation occurred?",liberals

gjj9h8w,2021-01-16T10:39:25.000-08:00,"listen up. here are the stakes. good points here. upvote for the effort in this.

i do agree that conservatives should stand their ground. the capitol riots were proof to progressives that their ideas are on the right side of history. this has emboldened them to pursue their agendas at full speed. comments on /r/canadapolitics are becoming increasingly forthright in condemnation of conservatives. i believe that i'm pretty centered politically, but i'm feeling as though i'm far right by reddit standards.

this endless pursuit of progressivism will eventually lead to the fall of our liberal democracy. people are imperfect, and society will never be fair as a consequence of human nature. the best days of our society could very well be behind us at this point. liberty will be taking a step backwards because of the reaction to the capitol riots, reaction to trump's presidency, and covid. it has me thinking lately.. we need to remind ourselves that liberty is a right that is earned through common decency and respect and belief in our political institutions. when the respect for our political institutions erodes, liberal democracy society is weak. sometimes we need to ignore injustices and unfairness in our society. ignorance *is* indeed bliss. we cannot handle the truth, dare i say.

unlike op though, i'm more interested in my personal self preservation than the preservation of conservatism. i do feel as though politics can be completely consuming the last few years, and we can all feel the tension. but, i will not be marching to parliament to protest my freedom of speech any time soon.
