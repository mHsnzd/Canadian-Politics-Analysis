\\- consider that bevs only serve urban communities given the lack of charging infrastructure and range (the same communities that can be served by ride-sharing and transit).

\\- read auto manufacturer 10-ks and other filings. pay particular attention to the (taxpayer-subsidized) profit margins on evs.

\\- nearly 20% of canadian electricity generation remains from fossil fuels.

\\- there are &lt;15k publicly available chargers in &lt;7k locations across canada. 90% are found in ontario, quebec and british columbia and only 20% are high speed. obviously, this makes bevs of little practical use and, as already mentioned, phevs don't offer as much emissions reduction.

every \"clean needle exchange\" in this country is a mess. all they are are magnets for drug dealers and for antisocial behaviour. 

people don't want \"clean needle exchanges\" in their neighbourhoods for the same reason they don't want homeless shelters in their neighbourhoods.

no regulation and the fact that they attract people from all over because they feel like they can do whatever they like. because these institutions aren't regulated and the only people staffing them are people like you. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;decriminalization, while important from a human rights perspective, doesn't begin to touch on the actual drivers of drug related harms, which are a toxic supply and expense. you can't do nothing to address the drivers of harm and declare it a success when the harm remains. that's just silly.

word salad ignoring the fact that crack and meth and heroin are fundamentally harmful, no matter how much is taken.

hdkdsgc,2021-09-19T17:33:01.000-07:00,"election 2021 - general discussion i'm much more at ease here than in hong kong. 

the so called conservatives here are a lot more moderate compared to hong kong, and in many western countries. 

a lot of the local prefectural governors are pretty progressive on social issues and climate change. it's just the literal dying group of holdouts left at the national level that hold greater power, that's still stuck in the showa era.

i'm currently working at a local public junior high school (everyone dutifully masked, not a karen in sight or heard) and the students are pretty progressive and on par with canadian students when it comes to views on lgbt equality and climate change imo. at least at my school, the principal and nurse's office door has a rainbow flag sticker. 

fwiw, the communist party of japan is actually a thing here, and was elected to a seat in my city when i last checked. also my city issues special certificates to same-sex couples so they can file and do a lot of administrative things the same as an opposite-sex couple could do, even though same-sex marriage is not legally recognised. 

but the japanese population as a whole is 29% seniors (65+), so overall it will definitely lean conservative for the time being. 

social cohesion and policy is actually very good. most of the politics here is extremely local, and the average japanese pays almost no mind to foreign policy. no party is actively out pursuing policies or trying to make life harder for any group of people or minorities. 

it also helps that all political parties are grounded in science, so battling corona was a uniform effort, and no party is anti mask or vaccine. 

the best thing is that there's no law/measures mandating masks or vaccines, but simply seen as a social responsibility and something everyone will do. i can comfortably say 99.99% of people in my city are masked whenever they're in a public setting. i can easily count the number of non-masked people with one hand on each outing, if any. the only time in recent memory i have seen a number of people not masked was a visit to an outdoor lavender farm, but even there it was 95%.  

to conclude, as a gay guy, i do not feel discriminated against, nor do i feel uncomfortable amongst the general population here in japan.

the main priorities of the conservative's here is more nationalistic and anti-china/korea, and not socially conservative per se. i can't say the same for hong kong, and china.",conservatives

the gun thing was just pure stupid -  i know perfectly well he was going to kill the gun grab with the committee but now we're saying \"yes his word is worth nothing and he's a liar, but it's ok boys because he's lying to the other side, trust us!\"  yeah - that might fly for a liberal leader with their people, but it' not going to fly with conservatives. and the left isn't going to be impressed at all. and it was such an easy question to answer and move on from, but he spent three whole days flip flopping on it before he stopped talking about it. people noticed that - he looked weak and dishonest even to people who didn't give a crap about guns. 

and honestly even without that they had nothing in the bag for the last half of the race! you have to have something to generate interest, to get people excited and worked up. and it's probably a good idea to have some negative attack stuff in your back pocket if all else fails. and there was just nothing.  his big press announcements were \"i'm happy to announce that i don't know where jason kenney is right now\".   well that ain't gonna cut it!

also, your claim on old growth logging approvals is pretty weak. john horgan doesn't personally issue logging permits. government-employed foresters do, based on established rules and criteria. perhaps, more permits have been approved because more permits have been sought? that matters is the percentage of requests authorized, the size of the harvest permitted, and the actual impact of new harvesting on ecosystems.",liberals

 *the problem with the last couple of conservative election campaigns is not that they were making the same arguments, but that they weren’t making any arguments at all.*

yup. i remember sending an email to my local conservative riding association before the 2015 election where i specifically said they needed to come up with some big, new policy idea or they were going to get creamed. they came up with nothing but a bunch of small, mostly tax policy changes for tailored voting blocks. that was also what they came up with during the next election, where andrew scheer performed so poorly, and ran screaming into the night whenever he was asked about anything remotely small-c conservative. this is a party which has been terrified to speak of conservative views, values or policies since harper almost lost his job to the troika of opposition stooges and became mister compromise.

or as coyne further says:

 *it wasn’t the rank and file that took the same platform to the electorate, election after election, with the same bouquet of microtargeted tax credits in place of substantive proposals for change – it was the leadership.* 

 *what positions has it taken that would make any real difference to anyone or involve any political risk whatsoever? can anyone even name a conservative policy?* 

o'toole does not appear to be much different than scheer in that regard. he'll replace the carbon tax with some new, amorphous 'better' climate change policy. yay. how exciting. oh, and he'll apply quebec's french language laws to businesses and organizations under federal jurisdiction - which is a betrayal of principle, assuming he has any. desperately whoring after a tiny number of quebecois votes while ignoring the wishes of the vast bulk of actual conservative supporters is also a tory tradition he seems to be continuing.",conservatives

gs22bf3,2021-03-24T01:17:31.000-07:00,"alberta’s petrostate propaganda has turned conspiratorial there is a huge misunderstanding and this has been twisted to make it look like the party are a bunch of climate deniers. 

1) the vote was an addition to an existing policy which already addresses climate change and green technologies. the policy, which still remains, already states that they believe climate change is a global issue and canada should also hold the largest emitters accountable while also stating that the conservative party believes in supporting green technology with government support. 

2) the general discussion around the policy amendment was the remainder of the wording. “climate change is real, the party is willing to act” are two sentences out of 6-10 that were proposed additions. 

3) many spoke in favour of this policy at convention, and were disappointed with the *update* to the policy, but we still recognize the policy already addresses climate change. 

4) the socons did show have a larger attendance, but the general consensus in the chat was we need to unite as a party on the ideologies that are the foundation to the party. personal beliefs of course attempt to get pushed by outliers, but its the exception not the norm. 

i personally reached out to the journalist jb tasker and we had a discussion around the “vote”. we even agreed on the fact that the policy already recognized climate change. 

personally, i am a centrist, and i would bet that many here fall within the same category and do not realize, or are not willing to admit. my biggest issue with the general feeling about the convention i see on reddit is that everyone is focusing on one negative, without really digging into it. so many read a headline and are already sold on that idea. i have zero issue with cbc or the media, their job is to report the news, but they are also responsible for making money, and sensationalist headlines sell and get attention. to me, those that jump on the auto attack of “this is the true colours of the conservatives” have never taken the time to chat with a true conservative (someone actually engaged with the party, not your crazy drunk uncle who is a rebel media conspiracy theorist) and understand that we are not all that different. 

i am willing to have open conversations with anyone that is willing to. the intent is not to change your beliefs and make you join the conservatives, but more an attempt to squash misconceptions - and an attempt to get rid of the wedge driven between political beliefs. this is not america, and so many are becoming polarized because of reoccurring rhetoric on social media / digital sources like reddit. 

on a side note, as a born and raised albertan (no longer living there) i did not support kenney and will never kenney or the ucp. my hometown mla is even worse then kenney, the mlas are reactionaries and are capitalizing on right wing social media that their constituents get sucked into. politicians have the ability to change opinion, and many albertan politicians have failed to do so. 

i guess if you want a tl;dr:

the headline is sensationalized, the party already acknowledges climate change. socons did not have the ultimate power you believe they do. most conservatives are united on the core ideas of the party, which are not the ideas the media tends to focus on. check your bias at the door, because how can we become a less divided nation if the right continues to call the left a bunch of green peace eco-terrorists, while the left calls the right a bunch of pro-life climate skeptics. work to be done on both ends of the spectrum.",conservatives

sorry, but which taxation powers would the provinces require (to fund the responsibilities downloaded to them) that they don't have already?

and when you say the federal government downloaded responsibilities to the provinces, can you give any examples of this that go beyond the federal government reducing funding levels? i understood provincial and federal responsibilities to be defined by the constitution, and i'm not aware of any true changes in what scope is considered provincial/federal. and if i'm generally correct here is that the government kept the responsibilities the same administratively, and just reduced their funding contribution, then the provinces simply need to replace the lost revenue to keep service levels unchanged.

bringing me back to my first question - which taxation rights did provinces lack, preventing them from replacing the lost revenue?",liberals
