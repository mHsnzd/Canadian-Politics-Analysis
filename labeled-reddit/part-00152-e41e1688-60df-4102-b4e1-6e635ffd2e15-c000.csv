haven't figured out how to use the quote feature yet, have you :)

and yeah i did :)

&gt;yes the whole reason i brought up the family was because i was making the point that we must conserve that social structure.

well that's obviously not true. you made no effort to connect the two.

nor is there a direct connection. the fact is family can thrive in all kinds of social structures. 

so you're back to just trying to cover up your mistakes. 

&gt;but sadly you missed the \"religion, family and tradition\" since communist russia didnt care about any of those. 

of course they do :) you honestly think communists don't care about their families? you honestly believe there's no traditions? they don't believe in health? give your head a shake. 

i mean you had to know how moronic that sounded, right? here's a clue jr, everybody cares about family, everybody cares about health, about their communities, and pretty near everybody has traditions that they see as important and religious and spiritual beliefs that they consider important as well. there is no political ideology where this isn't a factor. 

so yes the communists in russia do care about those things. absolutely, they are not conservatives for completely different reasons. 

wait - maybe they gave them up around the same time that britian took over france? you need to start thinking about what you say before you say it. 

&gt;&gt;    traditional conservatism is absolutely not effective **in a changing world.**

&gt;for the second time, i did not say that traditional conservatism is good **at changing the world.**

sigh.  and for the second time you literally couldn't read a simple sentance correctly. something that exists in a world that is changing is not the same as something that's changing the world. 

by the way - do you know what they call something that's good in a changing world? adaptable. ffs.

and no, you didn't even try to explain why conservatism is beneficial in a changing world or why it's adaptable. 

this is why nobody takes you seriously, you can't even get that right. 

and once again no case to be made here either, just \"it is because me say so!!!! ugh! you agree or me pound chest\". 

lets try it again. we'll keep it simple:

why would traditional conservatism, which included a strong adherence to the status quo for social structure etc etc and political policy enforcing that, be the best choice as conditions and political realities change around them? what would actually make it more adaptable. try to use your own words if you can.

hoppu9m,2021-12-15T08:03:52.000-08:00,"feds issue formal order for canadians to avoid travelling internationally do you not see how that’s clearly the plan? moderna and pfizer are purposely refusing the open the patents to their vaccines, which were both developed almost entirely on publicly funded research. if ending covid was actually the goal, those patents would be opened up so poor nations could afford to develop the vaccines themselves and get the rest of the world vaccinated.

instead, it’s incredibly more beneficial for big pharma to deny vaccines to most of the world so they can keep pumping out new variants which means pharma can keep pumping out new, variant specific boosters to sell to the rich countries.

this is an endless gravy train to the pharma companies if they allow the virus to continue, so what incentive do they have at all to actually stop covid? the vaccines don’t stop infection, they reduce hospitalizations. even if everyone was vaccinated, covid would stick around.

if you think that most of the people in the upper class of the world aren’t all getting extremely rich off this whole thing, you’re delusional. they have no incentive to actually solve the problem. 

answer me this — what incentive does someone like trudeau have to actually end the pandemic? do you think he actually gives 2 shits about the average person? he has vastly more incentive to *appear* to care, and *appear* to do something for the optics, while actually focusing more on what’s best for industry, because he likely has a direct financial incentive either through stock ownership, in kind benefits or the like. there’s zero incentive to care about the public beyond doing what’s necessary to *appear* to care.",liberals

the legislation was written by a political party. it's not a broad collective, it's a very specific group of people. if you can't take criticism of the motives of a political party seriously there doesn't seem to be much purpose in engaging in debate on a political forum.

&gt; like you want me to ignore that such a policy was the subject of 25+ years of special commissions in quebec

they've been trying to pass legislation to this effect for decades yes. the only difference is that they've gotten better at making the language sound neutral while still specifically targeting religious minorities. the 2013 implementation even had infographics showing that turbans/kippahs/hijabs were banned while cross necklaces were not.

for instance, harper in 2008 may have had some idea of the economic storm brewing, and may have hoped to preempt the financial crisis. his timing was somewhat off. he did stay in power, but the tories fell from majority levels.

chrétien in 2000 was capitalizing on a lot of different short-term trends. there was a bump for the liberals after the death of pierre trudeau. the alliance was very new and day inexperienced. given time, either clark or day might have been able to consolidate the right. ralph klein also gave chrétien a gift with his two-tier healthcare proposal. chrétien's timing mostly paid off.

even peterson may not have been wrong to call an election when he did. ontario slid into a really tough recession in 1990. if he waited, it would have been worse. perhaps if the election had been just slightly later, [dog house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv4nv_04phg&amp;ab_channel=heresboomer) a body-swap sitcom (the main character is a dog, digby, with the personality of the paterfamilias, a wise-cracking detective)  featuring his wife shelley (also a show i really liked for some reason), could have swung things.",liberals

i think housing is an issue where we need all levels of government working together:

1. at the municipal level, upzoning and speeding up permitting;

2. at the provincial level, overriding the municipal level if necessary;

3. at the federal level, providing funding.

i agree that more federal funding for non-profits to buy older low-rent housing is a good idea. and the national housing strategy does include a lot of funding explicitly earmarked for maintenance.

i think that trying to scale up the federal funding for building new below-market housing, as the ndp is proposing, is going to run straight into the nimby bottlenecks at the municipal level - it's not just market housing that nimby opponents object to, if anything social housing runs into even more resistance. in the city of vancouver, [a proposal to permit 12-story non-profit mixed-income housing projects](https://twitter.com/fabulavancouver/status/1395085580778708994) without requiring a public hearing and municipal ratification was recently voted down.",liberals

yes, this is true for all of the premiers.   unlike the united states, our provinces are effectively administrative divisions of the federal government.   only the federal parliament can make criminal laws, but if someone accuses you of a crime, you will go to a provincial court.  the provinces have discretion on some things that the federal government can't take away without amending the constitution ( like prisons, education, and certain taxes), and they are responsible for administration of federal programs like medicare.   

anything that isn't listed in the constitution we assume is within the power of the federal government.  you can find the full list [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/intergovernmental-affairs/services/federation/distribution-legislative-powers.html). 

i do not know what specifically scott moe wants, and he didn't say that in his speech.  part of the reason i say that this is bluster is that he listed no specific powers that he wanted or why he wanted them, except that he didn't like trudeau.  

my personal suspicion (and this is speculation) is that nobody is taking western separatism seriously, and it is actually more popular than anybody realizes.   moe probably knows this, and can't convince anyone in federal politics to listen to him about it.  so he tries to contain the sentiment by speaking like this.",liberals

i mean this is certainly anecdotal, but as a young person who was living abroad, i looked for work in calgary, vancouver, and toronto when returning last year. i will absolutely grant that calgary was my first choice because i grew up just outside the city, but i was serious about the idea of vancouver and toronto - i just couldn't make the math work. uniformly jobs paid less, and life cost more. this experience accords with what i have heard from other people in their late 20s. many of us left alberta for undergraduate/post graduate study, and some of us stayed in other provinces or in my case, abroad for work for a few years. but when it comes time to consider settling down somewhere, other provinces are so unaffordable that they realistically aren't options. of the ten or so people i know personally who moved away from alberta in their early 20s, (primarily to bc and ontario), only three have not moved back, and the third is currently mid return. 

but for non anecdotal evidence:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population\\_of\\_canada\\_by\\_province\\_and\\_territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/population_of_canada_by_province_and_territory)

alberta remains the fourth fastest growing province (only 0.5 percentage points behind ontario in third place) between 2016 and 2021. the fact that alberta has maintained its high growth positions **during an 8 year recession** and remains in close competition with other fast growing provinces (and nearly **double** the growth rate of quebec) is actually a vote of confidence in alberta's future. if this is how things go when times are bad, imagine how they'll go when things pick up again. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list\\_of\\_census\\_metropolitan\\_areas\\_and\\_agglomerations\\_in\\_canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_census_metropolitan_areas_and_agglomerations_in_canada)

additionally, of the five largest census metropolitan areas in the country, edmonton is the fastest growing at 11.16% over the past 5 years, with calgary coming in 3rd at 10.82%.

so if by \"real quick\" you mean \"no longer leaving leaving everyone in the dust\" i agree. but it still one of the top performers in terms of growth and looks on track to increase its demographic weight and influence over the next few decades. it will be interesting to see what trends take hold now that forecasts show alberta significantly outperforming the rest of the country economically over the next couple of years - and if that performance keeps up. 

furthermore, it maintains one of the healthiest demographic profiles in the country, as even your link notes that only manitoba has a lower median age, and even then only slightly. i expect the prairies' (including alberta's) youth relative to the rest of the country will continue to hold as housing affordability continues to sit at crisis levels in pretty much every other major metropolitan centre. 

&gt;the added population in bc and ontario is pretty liberal

citation please? the tories won their 2011 majority on strong support in bc and ontario, theres no reason to believe they couldn't do so again. in fact, they have steadily increased their vote share in ontario in both elections since 2015.

&gt;but hey if you think the cards are aligning more for the tories than the liberals and that the tories don’t need quebec

i mean, you're reading more into my comment than i think was stated. my point is simply that the easiest winning coalition for the tories to form is bc + prairies + rural/suburban ontario, with a smattering of seats in rural atlantic canada to pad the margin. 

my point is that particular alignment of seats is gaining in weight at the expense of quebec, so if thats your target coalition, that road gets a little easier. obviously the tories have to actually win their votes, which is a less clear thing. but quebec is not a keystone to their victory the same way it is for the liberals. the liberals **do not** form government without strong support from quebec. i'm sure the tories would love to have support in quebec - but past evidence has shown that they do not **require** it. as the seat math changes, the liberals have to **grow** their base away from their heartland so to speak, and in ontario in particular, their vote share has eroded over both of the previous two elections.",liberals

i'm 48. i remember the first microwaves in kitchens, which cost around $2,000. i remember our first vcr - we chose betamax - which was $1,500. our first home computer was over $3,000. if your fridge or stove broke down you called an actual repairman because the cost of replacing was incredibly high. the busiest store on the main street near where i lived was a vacuum repair outlet - the lineup would be out the door and down the block on a saturday. 

the atari 2600 retailed for usd$190 when it came out in 1980, which is the equivalent of almost $900 today. our cable tv - my dad starting doing okay in the late '80s to be able to afford it - was $150/month in late 1980s dollars. 

the idea that things used to be cheap and are getting expensive is not exactly true. they used to be expensive, got cheaper in price and quality because of the globalization of manufacturing, and now they're getting expensive again as other countries start to demand higher wages - the alternative being slave wages paid to third-world workers that use child labour, abusive practices, and carry on with a complete disregard for health and the environment. if the outcome of inflation is that people drive smaller cars (which people started to do after the '70s oil crisis) and change the way they consume, that's actually a good thing even if it will require an adjustment. the \"quality of life\" we've made our line in the sand hasn't really been around that long.

consider that in the '80s there was a mortgage crisis, and at one point mortgage interest rates were as high as 16% in canada. 

in my lifetime there have also been six major economic downturns where inflation and costs increased in some way - the '70s oil crisis, black monday in 1987 which wiped out my neighbourhood, the '90s recession, the '99 dotcom bubble burst, the 9-11 terror attacks, the 2008 great recession. i'm technically gen x, which means i was the first generation of college graduates that was told outright that we would be earning less than our parents. my graduation class also had to contend with massive competition for jobs and incredibly low starting wages - like $26,000 a year despite our higher levels of education. late stage capitalism was just starting to arrive and we were the first victims. 

our expectations for life have to change. before 1950, less than half of households had one car, much less two. by 1980 it was almost 90%. even though families have gotten smaller, the number of cars per household (who owned cars) also increased from one to around 1.8 in about 60 years. 

two generations got to enjoy a standard of living that was never sustainable, and they did it without regard for the damage they were causing the world. millions have died in wars to support this level of consumption. potentially billions are going to die or be turned into refugees as a result of climate change. we can't afford not to tax carbon, regardless of what effect it may have on consumer goods. maybe we'll go back to expensive but good quality products that can be repaired, upgraded and retrofitted, and will last us a lifetime.",liberals

how can we blame the federal government for what was, largely up until recently, a problem in two major municipalities. just prior to covid only a couple other cities were having prices creep up, but for the vast majority of the country nothing was super out of whack. 

so i also don't understand how it is their fault in particular. the bank of canada manages the interest rates that then get filtered through banking into mortgage rates based on the bond market. at what point does the federal government step into the realm of changing a bank of canada mandate or forces an interest rate change just to deal with housing and ignoring all other economic impacts?

municipalities manage zoning so at what point does the federal government step in and say to provinces that they'll withhold provincial transfers or municipal project funding until the gta and gva change zoning?

i don't know that we should even encourage the federal government to effectively step outside its juridictional boundary through the use of strong financial carrot/stick approaches that withhold transfers or other financial tools. a carrot is much easier to justify than a stick when it comes to effecting change that is outside of traditional jurisdiction. because withholding funds can quickly cause issues that will go to court where jurisdictional lines need to be drawn. and political expedience isn't a sufficient excuse there. 

its really very complex and asking the feds to save everyone from a problem that is largely, in terms of how widespread it is, novel and fueled by the pandemic, by stepping over and on top of lines isn't exactly kosher either. 

having a role to play doesn't mean they are blameless or faultless, but it also doesn't mean they are going to be the only solution. the most effective and fastest approach to solving this lies at a more local level. that's it. the feds can offer one side of the coin to pressure local levels, but people need to offer the other through their votes and getting involved locally. everyone complains about nimbys but those nimbys seem to have more political power and people on reddit point to the feds and complain but don't build the political capital necessary locally to fight nimbyism either.",liberals

&gt;median construction time required for nuclear reactors worldwide oscillated from around 84 months to 117 months, from 1981 to 2019 respectively. during the period in consideration, the longest median construction time for nuclear reactors was between 1996 and 2000, at 120 months, while the shortest was from 2001 to 2005, at about 57.5 months.

nuclear power plants are very expensive to build and take too long to build. in general, i think that nuclear is part of the solution to creating clean energy, but it is no silver bullet, even if the world somehow started mass building nuclear, it would plain and simply take too long for the energy transition timeline (we would need to train lots of people to build them and there would be lots of growing pains, extending these timelines further). in terms of the oil sands, they are already one of the most expensive forms of oil deposits to extract from (yes technological advances have made it more efficient, but they still have trouble competing with other sources). using nuclear as a power source would make them less competitive on the international market, essentially nullifying them as a profitable resource.

to be clear, i'm obviously not saying that we shouldn't be looking to reduce our per capita emissions. however, per capita emissions don't exist in a vacuum and it's important to consider the contextual factors that contribute to the discrepancies between countries. even if the average canadian and average chinese person were living identical lifestyles in terms of non-essential emissions, we'd still have the higher per capita numbers by a significant margin because of geographical and population factors.",liberals

&gt;&gt;analysis and polling conducted after the referendum identified two features that had not been well received: the proposal to increase the number of members in the legislature to make room for a certain number of list members; and the use of closed lists defined by the parties themselves as a mechanism.[36] aside from this, the major factor determining the outcome was widely seen to be the lack of adequate information and understanding of both the proposal itself and the citizen's assembly that had given rise to it. in a pre-referendum poll conducted in april 2007 by stratcom research, the most commonly cited argument in opposition to the mmp proposal was lack of information about it.[37]

&gt;&gt;other analysts, such as leduc et al. look to the ambivalence or hostility on the part of the political elite for an explanation. for them, the lack of information and balanced analysis available to voters was not an accident, but the result of inadequate funding, an excessively limited approach to public education by elections ontario, a last-minute approach to informing the public, the lack of attention to the role of the assembly, and hostility from the media elite.[40]",liberals

i know a lot of people complained about the greens not doing enough on the environmental aspect during the minority government, but the last year has shown the challenges they must have had in getting things done.

at the same time, the ndp can't abandon the environmental wing as that group played a large role in getting them elected in both elections. they hold a strong majority now, but the bc liberals will likely reclaim the outer areas of the lower mainland while the greens may start making vancouver island a more competitive place.",liberals

i think the bigger issue is that in 2019, there was a lot of enthusiasm within conservative circles. it didn't translate to swing voters, and that was their problem, but they solidified about 34% of canadians as their base, and they just had to build off of that. but now it seems like the cpc base itself is fragmenting, with a big chunk of conservatives seeing o'toole as weak and insufficiently conservative. there's a disconnect between o'toole's moderating instincts on things like social issues and climate change vs the cpc base's more right wing views, and there have been reports of dissatisfaction within the caucus. meanwhile, when o'toole has tried to stake out a more traditionally conservative position on nationalist/populist concerns like canada day, his delivery has been rough. it's clear that o'toole has a more \"pc\" vision of the conservative party when the base is looking more \"reform\", and softening turnout and enthusiasm can be a killer for a party that relies on its core base to turn out every election.",conservatives
