however, your point that electorates like governments that deliver good economic conditions is beside the point. after 1933 there was no electorate. the country was a dictatorship, so it didn't matter if the nazis delivered a good economy. indeed, they remained in power even as the war leveled germany and produced terrible conditions. 

dictatorships remain in power without delivering positive economic results all the time. maduro is still in power in venezuela, mugabe ruled for decades, etc. etc. that's kind of the point of being a dictator - you can stay in power without delivering the goods.

what was critical to hitler rising to power was the complicity of the centre-right. here i am speaking of the conservative parties whose cooperation allowed him to take power directly, but i am also talking about the large businesses that backed hitler with substantial resources. i'm talking about the von papens and schacts. it is for that reason that we need to pay close attention to the ways the centre-right engages with the far right today. do they legitimize, cooperate, and embrace the far-right? or do they stand with the rest in a popular front.",liberals

things were this way when the 'pc' party was closer to the left. it happens provincially and federally. this is not a problem with any 'radical right'. harper was in for 10 years - never once did anything 'radical' in the slightest socially.

and ignoring them will just make them larger.

the radical parts will never take over the cpc. period. and it's just not rational to think otherwise.  but the cpc does recognize that they should be heard. and when you listen to people you open a dialogue and sometimes you find common ground that everyone can agree on.

like leslyn - the conservative woman who ran for the leadership of the cpc recently - she addressed the abortion issue brilliantly. she said that the social conservatives want no abortion, but that's not what canadians want. so as a solution the abortion laws would not change under her but she would put more money into adoption supoort groups, funding for single moms and teaching kids about how to avoid pregnancies. which means less abortions.

everyone's happy. or at least less unhappy. :)

&gt;i think conservatism may be dying or at the very least transitioning into something different.

it isn't - and let me explain what's going to happen. you can see it again and again in history. the more you repress it, the more people treat conservatives like bad people, the more pressure builds up. and when it pops, and it always does, you get a radical at the helm. that's true of the left too btw.

so you get trumps and fords. or worse, you get hitlers and musolinis. just like you get stalins and mihns on the others side.

so do us all a favour - and don't pretend that you're not voting cpc because of some imaginary fear of some radical group.  because doing that actually creates radical groups in the end. vote for what's actually happening today and what's being proposed and what the track records are.",conservatives

there have been numerous, public debates on er.  there have been multiple referenda in various provinces on the issue.  it was a major topic of conversation during the 2015 election and a very public promise by the lpc at the time.  when they dropped the promise there was a flood of irate thinkpieces from the literati about how the lpc were betraying democracy.

despite this, there is no evidence whatsoever that the public feels any great urgency about enacting er (nevermind any specific version of er); there is no evidence that supporting or opposing er meaningfully moves votes; and there is no evidence that it's particularly of interest to the average person.

it's a niche issue, with niche interest.  that has nothing to do with whether or not its a good idea, it's simply a statement of fact.  it's also a statement of fact that throwing the phrase around has become almost reflexive among redditors who, when you engage with them further, rarely have anything interesting to add on that topic (or regarding politics in general).",liberals

furthermore, these claims of homophobia are quickly debunked when you consider the actual working of the ban. it has nothing to do with sexuality, it is entirely based on extremely high risk sexual behaviours. msm is among the highest possible risk sexual behaviour. homosexuals are more than welcome to donate blood, and for lesbians highly encouraged as the rates of communicable disease in their population is extremely low, provided they what 3 months after engaging in msm sexual behaviour. there’s a very similar prohibition on high risk sexual behaviour among heterosexual individuals.",liberals

&gt;what they found is that the class frame was generally more effective than either the race frame or the race plus class frame. \"despite observed increases in support for racial justice and democratic elites' use of race and class plus race frames in their public messaging, we find no evidence that americans are persuaded by these policy frames,\" they conclude in their paper.

hm5pc3z,2021-11-25T22:39:08.000-08:00,"liberals say they will allow provinces to ban handguns, citing rise in gun violence libertarianism isn’t a one size fits all flavour. i identify more closely with left libertarians than right. right libertarianism is primarily fluffy idealism that’ll never happen. left libertarianism tends to be a bit more realistic. the likelihood of a small government is so ridiculously minuscule that it’s not worth pondering over; and the government should honestly exist to benefit canadians, without ideally infringing on them. 

my brand is more that i want everyone to have a fair shake, be able to legally own a firearm, defend their own home and have freedom from discrimination and censorship. the ideal being that our government should exist solely to provide services for canadians and functionally represent us. 

you also glossed over the third paragraph where i specifically cite programs targeting root causes as well. you cannot address one without addressing the other. 

this isn’t a “one way or the other way.” kind of problem. the issues with illegal firearms entering canada are tied to many, many different pressures. some are illicit or illegal activities, others are more gang related. it also fits hand in hand with human trafficking and activity we can’t just wave away with a change of legislation. i can agree wholeheartedly in decriminalization of certain things, or the legalization of certain things; but we need to be cognizant that those activities would still occur. human trafficking has become more prevalent in canada; and even if we were to legalize prostitution, it still wouldn’t prevent the types of damages that occur from human trafficking, which falls into a whole other category. 

wherever there is the capacity for violence, there will be demand for the tools to enact it. meaning, that unless we somehow figure out a way to create some type of lush utopia where violence itself is no longer a viable option to anyone; there will be demand to purchase illegally obtained firearms. 

ideally a two tier approach works best. concentrate on eliminating root causes while also tightening enforcement on the organizations and individuals who are illegally transporting firearms. one will help alleviate the pressure on the other. when illegally obtained firearms quadruple in street value in 10 years and we have capable and well funded programs that can assist youth and help take pressures off of the types of people who seek out illegal firearms, then we’ll start seeing improvement. 

we also need to cognizant about the reality of canadian firearms crime. we have a low firearm related death rate per year compared to other countries with similar populations that are landlocked. combine that with the fact we’re next to a country with the highest rate of firearm related incidents and i think we’re doing relatively okay. we also need to consider that a majority of our firearms related deaths are actually suicides, with a minority being homicides. with that in mind it is important to target mental health requirements in addition to everything else; although most suicides are likely done with registered, legally owned firearms. no statistics to back that up, but i hardly imagine you’d risk buying an illegal firearm to shoot yourself in the face when you could just lie to get your pal. 

at the end of the day, we feel firearms related crime is actually a larger issue than it is. you’re right that we need to identify and target root causes; but i’ll stick by my initial comment of a two tier approach. we need to reduce supply of illegally available firearms while also addressing the things that create an environment that pushes people to buy illegal firearms.",liberals

hplne8a,2021-12-22T04:41:36.000-08:00,"ontario poll (leger) - pc 38%, ndp 28%, lib 25% &gt; he's been staying relatively out of the spotlight

that's not actually true.

i'm voting ndp this coming election, almost certainly, and i think the hate on for andrea horwath is bizarre and grounded in whimsical fantasy, not any form or reasonable analysis. i also think that del duca is... not a great candidate for premier for reasons that don't matter here.

having said that, del duca has been doing an excellent job at creating visibility and getting attention, while andrea horwath has been doing the opposite of that.

del duca correctly realised the most obvious fact of our time - the pandemic and how to handle it is the defining, most important issue of our time - not only in itself, but how our responses define our view of government, social responsibility and rights. 

so, he positioned himself as the hard foil to ford. he has consistently called for more stringent measures to combat the pandemic - from mandatory vaccine passports and vaccine mandates in the public sector and even key areas of the private sector, to more stringent inspections, stiffer business penalties and better mask policy enforcement. this was also backed with calls for proper supports.

horwath, on the other hand, had to be strong-armed by her caucus into accepting that vaccine mandates and passports were important things we needed to save lives. she had previously come out against them because they would hurt people's feelings and therefore make people feel isolated and bad. 

meanwhile, while del duca has been decisive while horwath waffled, the liberals have primarily focused on the core issues top of mind of a province facing multiple crises. 

horwath's ndp... have not. they have been more concerned with folks whose voices are less often heard in the noise of public health and housing catastrophes, like indigenous people dealing with land negotiations issues. they tried to make a big deal out of that issue in the middle of the pandemic. for some reason, the press and public appear to be preoccupied with all the hospitals nearly shutting down and what parents will do if schools close etc. 

so, while del duca has been consistent and focused, making him very quotable for cp24 and other quick news outlets, horwath has been waffling and, to be charitable, expansive in her priorities. 

these have been a bad two years for the ondp. fwiw, i don't blame it all on horwath. you lead the party you've got, and there's only so focused you're allowed to be in the ndp. del duca is a \"nobody\" to the public and his detractors, but in fact he's a seasoned political operator with a years of experience in one of the most important political lobbies in the country and as a cabinet minister, and is backed by people who seem to know what they're doing. he's done a bob-rae-esque good job as third party leader of stabilizing and creating a consistent brand that contrasts well to the ndp and pc's to enough people that the ndp should be concerned.

without having looking at these particular studies, what i can say is that the mainstream narrative of topics tends to be vastly over-simplified compared to what's actually put forth in journals. from glancing at headlines over the past few months, there has been controversy (that ended up being nothing, i think?) about potential heart issues. just to show that the science is rarely as solid or end-all, be-all as it is often treated.

one problem with the development timeline is that it inherently prevents long-term research prior to implementation. if we've only been putting people through testing for two years, we only know have evidence of the impact of testing for up to two years. if we changed something two months after the first test, then we only have evidence of two years minus two months. we need a new vaccine for delta, we'll be back close to square 1 in terms of the long-term impacts.

cpq is a smaller echo chamber and will never get far for the same reasons as qs.  

qlp is focusing too much on the large city centers and ignoring the rest.  plus lots of trust issues and dealing with the fallout of the barrette reform in the health sector which is in part responsible for the covid debacle.  

pq feels like a ship without a captain.  no wow factor, no real solid ideas or plan to get behind.  contrary to what many people think, pq is not only about separation.  it used to be a party that was more social oriented than the qlp which was always business oriented.  often they were compared as pq being a party of values while qlp was a party of oppotunity.  

the caq learned well.  they listen to the voters and focused on that.  not saying the caq is the best but they are certainly playing the game better than the others at the moment.  

caq is also the first time in my lifetime (44 years) that qc has been governed by someone else than pq or qlp.  after 44 years of back and forth maybe the caq will force the other parties to adapt and step up.  the next decade will be an interesting one for sure.",liberals

the problem with your cheeseburger analogy, or the idea of rights and anti-discrimination behind that, is that it can be applied too broadly. like, when the government makes a rule that government workers have to be vaccinated for covid-19 then i’d say that’s fine if its applied consistently. but in practice the consequences are worse for people whose religious beliefs prohibit vaccination, or who are otherwise convinced by their religions that this particular vaccine is somehow evil or taboo. so how does your same reasoning not apply there?",conservatives

as for the notion of rights being applied too broadly, this is something we've got decent solutions for.

rights aren't absolute. their recognition depends on the degree of infringment, the importance of the government objective, and the availability of alternatives. this is explicitly written into ss. 1 and 7 of the *charter*, but the same line of thinking goes back as far as *habeas corpus*. i'm sure it has recognition in french civil codes, too.

here, we've got a ban on certain forms of desirable employment based on religious observance. that's as direct as it gets. since the law doesn't actually address anyone's behavior, the objective seems to be virtue signaling for laicité. and it's tough to even consider alternatives when the law doesn't address a meaningful problem. honestly, from an outside perspective it seems like cruelty for its own sake.

applying the same criteria to vaccination mandates:

no religion actually condemns vaccination on a doctrinal level: at most you find local faith leaders spreading misinformation. the objective of vaccination mandates is to protect the young and the infirm from a deadly pandemic, and maintain public services. and an alternative to vaccination (isolation) is already built into most of the mandates.

there are tough cases. but these aren't, and in any case, that's what courts are for.",conservatives

full immunization will help bring an end to the same economic devastation/spending programs, restriction of movement, vaccine passports, and mask mandates that those who are anti-mask or anti-vax are actively whinging about. vaccination has improved personal health outcomes, limited new infections, and contained financial strain for those who have received their shot while those who haven't continue to needlessly twist the knife selfishly, ignorantly, or both for themselves and society. the fact remains that vaccination against a deadly virus isn't contained to a personal health choice. it's a public health choice.

it's appalling that we're considering a continued strain on all of the above in order to satisfy the lofty comfort and ignorance of the few. there is no reason the vaccinated should be paying for weekly testing or medical care for unvaccinated patients when it's all entirely unnecessary and the fault of the individual to \"keep up\".",conservatives

members wanted paul and they got her.

|no, you misunderstand. paul hasn't said anything directly, but her office sent out refusals to former star candidates with no official explanations as to why. if you listen to the podcast link i've sent to you, you'll see one of them, former leadership candidate judy green and former ceo of west nova riding, elaborating on all of that.

time stamp? and source of someone other than this 1 lady?

|out of every seat listed here (many of which happen to be liberal strongholds held by ministers!), the only one worth focusing on is outremont as deputy leader daniel green once obtained a good third result in the 2019 by-election. and even that is a long shot.

didn't paul win like 30% in one toronto riding?

where would you have her focus??

|yes, paul has been awful in her job ever since she became leader, which has come to a great surprise to me and many other members who voted for her.

so you are simply exaggerating, she hasn't been lead long.

&amp;#x200b;

|atwin has admitted in interviews that she would still be a green mp if elizabeth may was still leader. 

she lied, libs asked her to cross the floor.

| the breakdown in communication she experienced with paul (paul refusing to take her call, not replying to her, etc) has been experienced by many senior greens before this whole floor crossing incident. and people whose priority is to be part of a ruling party don't run and become elected as greens. she crossed the floors because she thinks her differences of opinion will be more respected with the liberals. i personally think that's naive but we'll see.

all according to atwin, which conflicts with her previous statements about an ultimatum, how do you give an ultimatum on a phone call to someone you claim you didn't talk to?  her district is pro-green.  she could have crossed the floor to ndp, or as an independent, she wanted power and got it.

|nope. she wanted paul to repudiate zatzman and to make it clear that her office wouldn't be working hard to defeat her in the upcoming election. she wanted assurances that the party wouldn't work against her, and paul wouldn't give it. it wasn't about having a different stance than paul's.

yes, but that was before that whole public airing of green issues and the floor crossing. i think there was potential in toronto-centre because of that leader's boost, but not now that the greens are sliding in the polls. she's unlikely to do that well in the general election. toronto isn't a green friendly place at all. 

&gt;where would you have her focus??

victoria, other places in bc that did well in 2019 and that overlap with provincial green strength. guelph. pei ridings. beauséjour, where the greens shocked by pulling 27% last time. moncton-riverview-dieppe. we should start where there's already proof of green interest, not shoot for the moon. the goal is to reach 12 seats for official status.

no, she was being truthful. she was asked to cross the floor because the liberals knew about her difficulty with paul. they used nate erskine-smith to make the point about being a big tent party and sent dominic leblanc to seal the deal. none of this would have happened if may was leader.

gi7e1v8,2021-01-05T02:26:22.000-08:00,"doug ford's credibility on covid-19 goes poof &gt; it's a common tactic to cherry-pick one part of a statement to refute and then presume that the response refutes the whole statement.

a challenge here is usually the statements being made aren't necessarily suited for that sort of response. the post i replied to was less point/counter-point arguments, and more of a narrative telling of a person's view of ford.

in my experience attempting to address all the points of such a post will lead to exactly the same thing you described; it's a scenario that's happened many times to me. i might go and do a bunch of research, pull some statistics, do some calculations, only to have the person i responded to focus on a poor word choice. 

instead in this cases i tend to focus on addressing the root of the narrative, while treating the rest of the statement as supporting arguments. in the case the op's narrative thread was that ford was doing the bare minimum, with supporting evidence being ltc deaths, nepotism, character attacks, a comparative statement, and a dismissal of conservative values. i tried to touch upon the ltc since to me that was the only argument that could be easily corroborated, but i did not touch the other ones because i read them as emotional statements.

&gt; ...it's time we put a stop to that. it's time to start holding these politicians accountable. we are reasonably more educated and aware relative to the past it's getting harder for them to pull the wool over our eyes.

i started following politics in my teenage years, in the early 2000s. since then i've heard variation on that statement more times than i chose to count. if i can be perfectly honest, i feel that this statement was more true back then than it is now.

the biggest challenge is getting wide agreement on what to hold politicians accountable for. in some cases it's easy; when someone's literally raped someone else it's usually a slam-dunk case; neither side likes rape. however, other topics are harder to get a unified response for. take the whole travel thing; half the conservative base literally believes the lock-downs are unlawful, so to them the idea of a politician travelling is less of a punishable offense, and more of a praise-worthy act of defiance. 

&gt; maybe ford could have used some of that unused federal covid funding to hire more psw's and to give them paid sick days so they aren't forced to go to work when they might have covid because they are already severely underpaid as it is.

this speaks straight to the heart of the matter. one of the biggest issues is that conservatives tend to, at least in principle, believe that government should not be funding social enterprises. a psw worker falls squarely in this category. they are usually not medical professionals, but instead support staff for medical workers. as such the conservative government doesn't really want anything to do with them.

for a double whammy, given the current structure of the ltc system, the government is not really equipped to staff these sort of positions, save perhaps by calling in the army like we saw at the beginning of the year. in other words if they wanted to hire more such workers, they would most likely just give money to the actual businesses running these homes, and then face backlash when inevitably some of these businesses spent that money on other projects. it seems to me like they are depending on the actual ltc homes to make the right decision, which is inevitably going to lead to some of the most poorly run homes being unable to handle the load. 

in effect, from a conservative mindset, funding to expand staffing at such places is basically equivalent to the government spending money on a failing business. 

while there are very obvious risks to the health and safety of the residents, such improvements are quite hard to quantify for the average [istj](https://www.verywellmind.com/istj-introversion-sensing-thinking-judgment-2795992) conservative. 

&gt; they not only say stupid stuff but they haven't been leading by example, hence the wave of resignations currently ongoing. rules for thee not for me. at least there have been some consequences recently.

if i'm honest i barely ever see politicians leading by example outside of the campaign trail. be it conservative or liberal, these are generally powerful people. as much as it sucks, the reality of power dynamics does mean that there are rules that are unfairly applied. in these scenarios the only way to hold the people in power accountable is to make it very clear and very public that the populace expects certain rules to apply to everybody. 

beyond that, the only way i could see around the whole rules for thee and not for me issue is to have an even higher standing power structure, one that is non-corruptible and non-emotional such as an ai, though even that comes with it's own issues.

&gt; i'm not a lawyer so i can't say much about the legality other than i'm sure there is something he could do to punish people doing dumb shit. like the protests and these gatherings, but that speaks to an even bigger problem we have with the police that we don't need to go into right now for the sake of this conversation.

certainly a politician could encourage the police to fine more proactively, and they could even pass laws to extend police powers. though then we come back to your previous point; this would further extend the \"rules for thee and not for me\" issue. if you give police more power, that doesn't guarantee that they will apply that power equally in all situations. 

&gt; i'm sure walmart could set up a curbside pickup program within a week.

there's a few challenges to a good pickup program.

one of the most universal issues is the time delay. i've been doing a reno project for a while, and during pickup-only periods there can easily be weeks between order and pickup. this might be acceptable for reno crap, or for plastic doohickeys from china, but much less so for basic requirements and tools necessary to live in a modern society. in other words walmart would need to have the world's best curbside program to meet the needs of the people that go to walmart, which in turn are usually people that can't just order whatever they want from amazon. 

the second issue is that curbside pickup logistics really are quire hard, particularly for larger stores. a small 4m x 20m storefront can probably handle it with two or three people, but for huge 100m x 150m box store simply picking the correct products from the store and getting them to the front is a logistical challenge even for a small number of orders. for thousands of orders a day it would be a nightmare.

essentially, curbside pickup is great for stores that are frequented by richer, more selective clientele. the type of stores that even pre-covid might only see a few visitors per hour.

&gt; if the goal is to save lives and stop the spread of covid then yes. i got fucked out of school when i went because of strikes, this is an even better reason.

if these were similar strikes i saw in the 90s, that was around a month off school. that's something we can make up over the remaining 12 years of education. however, making up for a year of lost time is going to be far harder, particularly for kids whose parents can't afford to keep them engaged for the entire period. if we were to keep schools closed for that long then that is a huge period during kid's most formative years that we will lose. in a world as competitive as ours is that's a major hit to their future ability to support themselves.

that actually brings up the question of what exactly is the goal. if we wanted to literally eradicate covid through social isolation; well, we've seen enough examples around the world to know that this alone isn't enough unless you pull a taiwan or vietnam and simply never let the virus in.

&gt; they pay people with a lot of education a lot of money to come up with these ideas, and i can tell they are half-assed and serve the economy more than they serve the public. my idea? an actual lockdown for a month. close down everything, schools, borders, stores, workplaces. everyone stays home for a month, use that money to provide support for people who need it, and we will beat this thing. not these half-assed 'mockdowns' that do nothing because they ignore the main causes of spread and blame it on bogeymen like international travellers.

i would honestly be ok with that. so would nearly everyone i know.

however, almost everyone i know works cushy office jobs that we can do from home. 

unfortunately i also know people that live paycheck to paycheck, stacking boxes, or loading planes, or even running pcr test samples. those people simply can't afford to be locked down if they want to eat, and i definitely wouldn't want that last person to be locked down cause they run covid tests.

an absolute, full lockdown means being able to provide for all of these people.

it also means greatly extending police powers, to the point where they could go full china and literally lock people in their houses, and throw them into a jail cell if they so much as open the door. coming back to \"rules for thee and not for me\" idea, i don't mind living in a country where a politician might travel on a half-loaded plane defying travel guidelines, but i would not want to live in a country where these selective rules include some people being put into jail cells.",conservatives

he's a little off in a few other areas as well - he notes the  number of immigrants and the effect on homes but doesn't factor in the number of deaths and the reduction of demand. he also fails to note that the number of people wanting new homes is irrelevant - just like the gdp the issue is 'net new homes to net new homeowner\" ratio.  if we're bringing in more people we should build more homes, and why aren't we. or we should be settling them in areas where there are more homes. the problem there isn't immigration. further - the evidence is strong that it's not new canadians who are putting demands on housing prices. the rental market may be more influenced but not ownership.

now what could trigger that election?  it will be a poorly performing. economy, which is something any government struggles  to survive..  the liberals  could see high inflation coming before last election , which was the reason they pulled the ripcord now rather than fight a campaign as the economy gets worse. and they have an inescapable problem the - nobody to blame, nobody else in power for . 8 or 9 years.   it’s easy enough for their weak showing in the popular vote to translate into a commensurate reduction in seats.",liberals

her8sk5,2021-09-29T04:55:27.000-07:00,"conservatives must solve their suburban conundrum i'm not judgmental towards women who get abortions out of necessity, such as if the pregnancy is directly threatening her life...but most abortions are convenience abortions where the woman doesn't want to deal with the natural consequences of her actions (having sex). in that circumstance, it's kind of difficult not to be judgmental when we're talking about ending a human life.

there are plenty of choices other than abortion. there is abstinence, adoption, and keeping the child.

you cannot compare a live fetus to a deceased corpse. one is alive and the other isn't. what about the fetus' bodily autonomy? the fetus gets no say. why should the mother's bodily autonomy trump the fetus'? no person's life is directly and immediately ended because someone didn't want to be an organ donor. it's a false equivalence.

okay, so even if canada and the usa and other first-world countries get on board and drastically lower their carbon emissions...what about places like china and india who pollute much more than we do? we have no control over them. will our efforts even make a dent when china and india will continue doing whatever they want? will it make enough of a difference?",conservatives
