the scientist who is no longer going to take part in future reports is exactly right. we have had thousands of studies and reports on how we fucking everything up, but nobody cares. it's a waste of the scientists time to write a report that common people will blow off as an \"overreaction\".

in saskatchewan especially, our uranium reserves should have warranted several reactors by now, but politics will politic, and it went unused for decades. now it is starting to look at micro reactors, but those won't be ready for another decade. we've dragged our feet for something so plentiful and easy to swap over to. we won't make any meaningful change anytime soon. too many people just don't care, and the ones who do care are treated as children.

profits being people's god have ultimately screwed everyone. carbon capture could work, we've had the science since the 1930's, but the latest breakthrough is still $50 per metric ton. you have a hard enough time getting someone to pay a few cents a litre on fuel more, and a lot of those people out west support that industry.

the fear of accepting that life isn't good is too much for a lot of people, hence the fear of change. i don't get it. i really don't. we will find a way to survive, for sure. but the amount of death that awaits is worrying. human yes, but biodiversity as we know it will be completely different.",liberals

plenty of socons are cpc elites, so they have clear motivation right there.       
      
right now the conservatives have the lowest available voter population (people who would consider voting for them) out of the three major national parties. socons are a significant portion of their current base, but at the cost of being able to access a large pool of otherwise gettable voters. 

they're also distributed in a manner that means they win some ridings easily at the cost of winning other ridings *at all*.     
         
the cpc base is becoming more rural and \"pigeonholed\", whereas nova scotia recently made a strong argument for the idea that a firmly progressive conservative platform* can have broad appeal. it would probably lose some votes in alberta (where it can afford to lose votes without significant seat loss) but could gain significantly in battleground suburbs where they're currently competitive but losing.

so you've shifted your goalposts in order to try and continue making sense. you started with the idea that people in public facing jobs should not wear anything that signifies their personal values. now you're simply saying that \"uniforms\" in such jobs should be as impersonal as possible and people shouldn't step outside of that level of conformity. i'm not sure you've even thought this through, it's not like all teachers dress the same way. let me explain.

the people in the positions we are discussing don't necessarily have uniforms. service canada workers don't have uniforms. teachers don't have uniforms. they do have dress restrictions, but nothing like uniforms. the dress restrictions should be based on bona fide occupational requirements. this means that teachers have plenty of leeway in determining how they want to dress for the job. if a teacher's aesthetic values push them to wear blue or green, they can do so. but once a teacher's personal values as a sikh push them to wear a turban, you suddenly have a problem with it. how is that more impersonal a choice than the choice to wear a green turtleneck because you love green and you love turtlenecks? it isn't. your rationale once again holds no water.

if a teacher was to wear a turban for the same reason they wore green, simply out of an aesthetic preference, would you then not have a problem with it? if the answer is yes, this clearly shows that turbans do not conflict with a teacher's ability to do their job in any way. if the answer is no, then you simply have a weird problem with turbans and there's no point even arguing with you. 

i don't expect you to answer my challenging questions or deal with the actual substance of what i'm saying because you would have done that by now. you've left most of what i've said in previous comments unaddressed. now i'm just writing this for anybody else who might read this. i don't want to write a whole essay, i'll just leave it at that for now.",conservatives

h400y2u,2021-07-03T16:58:29.000-07:00,"canadians want governments working harder on indigenous reconciliation: usask researcher yet he keeps getting elected.

i have a hunch that many canadians, when they really understand what first nations people are asking for, would say \"nope let's not\". 

i suspect that maybe a leader who performatively supports reconciliation and tackles relatively low hanging fruit\" like ending some boil water advisories here and there and funding indigenous language education, but stops short of doing the hard work of negotiating new treaties to open the way to fn self-government (i.e. giving fns something similar to what nunavut is for the inuit), is exactly what canadians actually want.

to be clear, i'm not saying trudeau hates fns. i think he sincerely wants to do things to help fns, and he's willing to do some things to help them, provided they don't dramatically change how canada works. but the 1996 rcap report envisions amending the constitution and creating a new governing structure for fns, and there'd be a few dozen ... kind of like \"mini-provinces\"? ... but anyways, jurisdictions run by and for fns which can levy taxes to fund services to fns that provinces or cities normally do.

new negotiations that change how the country works on a fundamental level are really hard to do (look how much effort went into the charter and the patriation, or meech lake and charlottetown) - only p. trudeau and mulroney have tried it in the last 70 years. if we fulfilled even half of what some fns are demanding, it would piss off a lot of powerful interests. 

mining and oil companies wouldn't be happy (the thing is, i'm pretty sure, if fn self-government ever came to be, there would be quite a number of nations willing to partner with such companies to exploit their natural resources for profit. but why would you risk it when the status quo works for you?) and if we have trouble building affordable housing because existing homeowners are worried it'll make their home prices drop ... what do you think nimbys will do when the government starts talking about setting up fn jurisdictions all over the place?

so in a way it's hard to blame trudeau (or chrétien, or harper): is there a big enough consensus among canadians that \"properly\" resolving the aboriginal issue once and for all (by properly, i mean through self-government as fn representatives desire, and not mass assimilation) is worth doing? until the answer to that question is \"yes\", every prime minister ever will fail at achieving \"reconciliation\".",liberals

that shows that our system is about voting for individual mps, not parties. although his former party was listed on the ballot, he won the seat, and that party did not. even though he is not a liberal anymore, he keeps the seat, the party does not.

hefwmul,2021-09-26T15:46:21.000-07:00,"liberals plan to make immigration to canada much easier. this 'article' is so poorly researched and so misleading that you might as well just call it propaganda.

they constantly conflate immigrants and refugees, referring to total immigration numbers while making arguments about procedures that apply only to refugees. in fact, the vast majority of immigrants to canada are **not** refugees. in 2020, [less than 10% of immigration](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-parliament-immigration-2020.html) to canada was under the refugee class, which is the only class that could possibly be impacted by the changes being referred to here.

this following statement alone should be bad enough for any self-respecting outlet to want to retract this whole mess:

&gt;that’s how the liberals intend to turn 300,000 or so immigrants a year into 400,000 almost overnight.

complete nonsense on multiple levels.

ircc has [published](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/supplementary-immigration-levels-2021-2023.html) exactly how they intend to hit the 400,000 number, and it's certainly not by bringing in 100k additional refugees through easier rules.

the number of immigrants admitted to canada in 2020 is actually closer to 340k than 300k, so the net increase for 2021 would be about 60k. of that increase of 60k, about 36k (\\~60%) would be from new economic immigrants, 12k (\\~20%) would be from new family class applicants, and another 12k (\\~20%) would be from the refugees/protected person category (\\~20%). so even if this article was correct in its argument, these supposedly nefarious new rules would result in the admission of an additional 12k people in canada - about a tenth of the scary number it throws around.

of course, the article *isn't* correct in its arguments either. almost the entire content of the article is a blatant misrepresentation of how the irb works and and reveals the lack of even a rudimentary understanding of how it handles things like intersectionality and evidentiary standards.

that government debt can grow in size so long as its commersurate with growth of the tax base isn't mmt, it's pretty basic finance. what mmt says is that the only constraint on government debt is inflation, which is different. also inflation isn't directly related to the amount of money in circulation, that's a common misunderstanding. inflation relates more to the velocity of money within the system which ends up affecting the average cost of goods. if an increase in money supply doesn't circulate or ends up in investments, inflation doesn't  happen as a result.

further, with regards to the covid debt, the federal books were sufficiently healthy ahead of time and the interest rates (and costs of servicing) are so low and look to remain that way that there is very little issue with just keeping the balance on the books going forward, so the long term effects on public spending and taxes aren't expected to be all that large. right now the burden of debt service for the federal government is about as low as its been since the end of ww2 and we are very, very far away from a 1995 style debt crisis.",liberals

inflation is by far the largest  and most pernicious tax on the poor. housing prices are up 30% in a year, when cmhc thought they would go down by 10-15%.  now anyone who was close to buying a house will have to pay a 30% premium on something that should be 10-15% less.

gyo93lw,2021-05-18T18:24:13.000-07:00,"diane francis: trudeau's immigration scheme is just another way to redistribute canada's wealth &gt;aims are to allow 1.2 million more permanent residents into canada in the next three years when other, well-managed countries like australia and new zealand, are preoccupied with retaining the living standards of their existing populaces by trimming immigration.

what a shoddy thesis. the presumes that retaining living standards isn't congruent with immigration.  


&gt;to analyze the benefits of immigration, it’s important to look at the gdp per capita figures. this metric makes it obvious that canadian immigration has served mostly to cut the pie into smaller pieces for everybody: canada’s gdp ranks ninth in size, but its gdp per capita is only 18th, less than the u.s. gdp per capita at fifth place, or australia’s at 9th place.

again, this assumes that the economy is somewhat fixed and the more people we bring in, the lower gdp/capita gets. could immigration lower gdp/capita? sure. it can go the other way too. as an extreme example, america gets a pretty substantial boost out of all the immigrants working in their tech sector.  

ignoring that, let's look at what the impacts are 1 generation in:

**males**

2nd generation average incomes: 65,700

third-plus generation whites: 62,700


**females**

2nd generation average incomes: 48,200

third-plus generation whites: 43,500

https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2019006-eng.htm

**us centric but relevant enough**
&gt;finally, peri finds that for less educated natives, higher immigration has very little effect on wages, while for highly educated natives, the wage effect of higher immigration is positive. in summary, he finds that a **one percent increase in employment in a us state, attributable only to immigration, is associated with a 0.4 to 0.5 percent increase in income per worker in that state.**

https://www.nber.org/digest/mar10/effect-immigration-productivity-evidence-us-states

&gt;other reasons this aggressiveness is inappropriate is because the u.s. recovery may not flow northward as border closures continue, or the likelihood that new entrants will be unable to find jobs or, if they do, will displace workers already here.

new entrants also bring aggregate demand in addition to labour supply. it's like saying more people at a potluck means you are more likely to run out of food. no, everyone both consumes food and brings a dish.",liberals

what are you, one of those weirdos who loses a discussion and just randomly asks for people to repost the same proofs they already have because they can't cope with it emotionally? 

are you that emotionally crippled? god knows the left is a little weird like that but repeatingly asking for a link i've already posted is just sad. 

as to being 'disingenuous', which is beyond childish (you seem to have a theme going),  that is hardly the case. yes - fuel is going to go up.  going to. as in, will affect our future. it does not affect our past all the way back to april. 

but regardless it will be going up because of demand - which is fueled in part by people being able to get back outside combined with the fact they've got money in their pockets to spend on fuel!  an why do they have that if they weren't working? want to take a guess? turns out when you dumb a hundred billion of un-earned dollars into the economy supply and demand get out of whack. whodathunkit? i mean - except for everyone other than the liberals. 

car dealers are paying premiums for used cars because people have money to spend on used cars. and the reason they do is because of the billions of unearned dollars being dumped into the economy.  you'll notice new car sales, which is much more likely to require you to be employed to get a loan, were down most of that time.  and there is actually a surplus of new vehicles at the moment. production went down by 25 percent but sales were down by close to 35.  so - monetary policy. how are all these out of work people affording used vehicles otherwise. 

gas prices aren't much higher than they were pre-covid, but they did go up before that thanks to trudeau's carbon tax. again - policy. and drivers are labour - which is what i said - thank you for making my point. 

the price of lumber skyrocketed due to labour shortages due at least in part to cerb and other benefits on the one side and higher demand due to money flooding into the economy from the gov't (both canada and us) . so - monetary policy. and no - it's come down but it's still higher than it was.  and what do you mean 'even lumber' - did you mean only lumber? pretty much everything else is still high and getting higher. 

and for a guy who demands again and again that i post links to my stats that i've already posted, you sure don't post a lot of proofs.

like your economic theory?  thank rich people in the 80s for developing it to hijack government and take over an ever growing chunk of the us economy.  yes i love having a ultra pricy piece of planned obsolesent technology that needs to be replaced every year and that uses cutting edge super computing to let me check instagram.  really i obviously do like my smart phone, but it's clearly just a piece of consumer crap that doesn't actually make my life that much better.  the thing is that the smartphone argument probably is the best argument for unlimited unrestrained corporate power.  they definitely *do* a really good job of marketing and churning out expensive consumer crap that you have to replace frequently.  and in some ways it is good, i would rather apple make my iphone (which is user friendly, well designed, and has developed technologically very rapidly) than the federal bureau of handheld communicator development.  it's just that the relative importance of a little pocket computer is way less than the relative importance of healthcare, housing, etc etc

&gt; well at least you got something right. but uh, *favour eh? ;)
