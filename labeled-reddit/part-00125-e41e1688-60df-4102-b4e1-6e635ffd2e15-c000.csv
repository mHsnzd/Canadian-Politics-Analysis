greens - huge relative gain. they managed 6.5% popular vote last election, which would give (0.065 x 338 seats = 22 seats), seven times more than they actually got. not to mention the loss of strategic voting would finally stop them from being a “wasted vote” in strategic voting scenarios.",liberals

i agree with his immigration policy to an extent. i don’t like his policy of not uniting families, but 150,000 immigrants a year i think is pretty reasonable. i also think what he means by assimilate is to embrace canadian culture. for example my neighbours are first generation immigrants from pakistan, and they’ve assimilated into canadian culture. they own a small business, always have a canadian flag in their front yard, and absolutely love canada in general. this is what i think of as assimilation, but i could also be projecting what i think onto bernier.

**multi-member districts in most places**

depending on how the system is designed, voters would elect mps from across the district by marking their ballots with a simple x (an open party list) or by ranking their choices (stv or local pr).

**single-member ridings in sparsely-populated regions** 

voting in such ridings could be with a single x like in first-past-the-post, or by ranked ballot.

**a small layer of regional top up seats**

because the multi-member ridings are already proportional, there would only need to be about 10-15% regional top-up seats to make the results in the whole region proportional.

making room for these top-up seats would require some adjustment in the boundaries of ridings and multi-member districts which would have to become about 15% bigger. however, the accomodation of top-up seats is much easier under rural-urban proportional than under mixed-member proportional, because the number of top-up seats needed (regional mlas) is much smaller. under mmp, the size of local ridings would have to increase by about 67%.

winners of regional top-up seats could be chosen from the best runners up at the sub-regional level or by regional open list.",liberals

hdctj9e,2021-09-18T03:40:50.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected there definitely is evidence:

this article by a former ndp strategist highlights some problems:

https://thetyee.ca/opinion/2016/08/16/proportional-representation-in-canada/

in australia:

&gt; **australia’s one nation party now holds four seats and the balance of power in that country’s senate** – making centre-right liberal prime minister malcolm turnbull dependent on senators like malcolm roberts, **who has suggested that climate change is a “scam”** created by “corrupt” united nations reports and international banks.

&gt; **turnbull’s other unlikely allies are** three senators from the nick xenophon team – named after its leader, a group labour party deputy leader tanya plibersek described as a **“rag-tag bunch of crackpots.”** xenophon himself is known for publicity stunts like wearing pajamas to an all-night legislative session and adamantly campaigning against both poker machines and wind turbines.



in italy:

&gt; italy is another country with a proportional representation electoral system – and **enormous instability.** its **parliament has been forced to dissolve eight times in the past 40 years due to coalitions disintegrating.**

in israel:

&gt; and the consequences can be not comic but tragic in a country like israel, writes alex bain in an article for the middle east institute: “israeli politics is notable for its wide array of parties and unstable coalition governments. the main institutional cause of this chronic instability is the system of nationwide proportional representation, which **gives disproportionate influence to minor parties,”** bain says. 

and overall:

&gt; **but whatever system of proportional representation is used, minority governments, unstable coalitions, bizarre candidates and backroom dealing politics are common.**
--


&gt; this disturbing possibility is already a reality in many countries with proportional representation electoral systems, including italy, israel and australia – where single-issue, religious fundamentalist, anti-immigrant and personal vanity parties regularly must be courted to create a coalition government.


what would happen under proportional representation is that the parties would fragment into a bunch of different parties, and then you don't exactly what you're voting for, because the government then gets formed via backroom deals the parties make after the election.

some people cite scandinavian countries as places where proportional representation maybe works, but they're small countries with small populations. canada is very diverse and vast, and having a lot of different parties could open-up fissures in canadian society (even worse than what's currently happening).

new zealand is also tiny, and germany is geographically half the size of saskatchewan, so it doesn't have canada's urban/rural divide, because their countryside is so close to their major cities (and minor cities).

canada is far more vast and diverse than other countries that use pr.  australia (also vast, but not as diverse) does use pr for their senate, but the above quotes mention some of the problems they've had.

aside from his flowery rhetoric, o'toole hasn't done any of the heavy lifted necessary to show he's willing to stop feeding the alt-right.  just last week, he started a stupid non issue about vaccinating prisoners, thereby promoting harmful dehumanization of people in prisons.  he specifically ran on a platform of using the notwithstanding clause to over-rule court decisions that found his criminal justice legislation unconstitutional, which signals that he simply doesn't care about the constitution.  if he did, why over-ride judges who are tasked with interpreting the charter?  

abandoning those policies and saying, \"we need an intelligent criminal justice policy that isn't based on treating prisoners as subhumans and judges as a hostile element, and we also care for and respect the charter as the supreme law of the land\" would be a good start.",conservatives

otoole means exactly what he says - the cpc would govern differently from the liberals with more austerity and less giving a flying fuck about actual issues, and possibly a dash of shitting on minorities. however they are nowhere near winning so it’s a moot point. the realistic scenarios are liberal majority or slim minority. the cpc isn’t going to rebound in time for the election, not with how abysmally they have performed these last two years.

but, if the liberals can’t attract ndp voters that is on them. same as it’s on the ndp if they can’t attract liberal voters. however, you make a gross exaggeration in pretending the ndp has accomplished nothing with its existence - just by being there they act as a pull on the liberals to the left, and, in minority situations, like now, they do have some policy sway. without an incentive to actually be progressive the liberals, time and again; will show they are not. though once progressive ideas are around long enough to become popular they’re happy to oblige. 

do you even know how our healthcare originated?
yeah, the ndp has a lot to do with that. cerb being 2k instead of 1k? ndp. the list can go on.

we are not a two party system and shouldn’t treat the country like it, or want that scenario, because it’s fucking terrible - the cpc would go further and further to the right and the liberals would follow to cater to “centrists” just like south of the border. canada’s multi party system is a massive improvement over that of our southern neighbours. and frankly i don’t give a damn if liberals want to complain about vote splitting, because if they’d done as they promised and enacted any form of reform, even stv, then it would literally not be an issue - they would have forced the cpc to actually reinvent itself to have a chance at government basically ever. and if they went with popular vote, well, coalition governments like his minority, which clearly operated well enough to get us through this crisis, would be the norm, reducing the chance the cpc can inflict much of any harm.

if the liberals somehow fuck up, get burned by it; and we’re in another minority, that’s not the ndp’s fault or problem. stop trying to blame the failure of the liberals to actually reach out to and represent a significant portion of the population on said voters. the liberals are not owed the progressive vote, especially when they frequently abandon or water down progressive promises.

the simple fact is that they've put themselves into a position of irrelevance by only attracting the far-right and other fringe voters. if the cpc moves to the centre on social and climate policy (to the extent they're basically the modern equivalent of where the mulroney/campbell pc's were in the early 90s), they'll make up any loss in reform/paleoconservative votes via moderates and undecideds, which would allow them to expand their base and actually be a threat to the liberals again. meanwhile, even if the ppc wins seats under electoral reform, they'll be the most irrelevant and isolated group in parliament. the green's with two seats would have more leverage in parliament than the ppc with 10-20, just from being able to actually compromise with the other parties.

bernier and co. might actually be more of a blessing in disguise for canadian politics than a hinderance. if they woo away the reform and far-right elements from the cpc, they'll be taking them away from a place where they actually have some semblance of authority, to a place where they won't have any. that would make canadian politics far healthier/less combative and make elections in general more competitive since the liberals and cpc would by fighting for more votes from one another (which would put more onus on both of them to preform better/pitch better policies).",liberals

&gt; this is the alberta government and media's fault, first and foremost, and albertans shouldn't have to pay for their mistakes.

\"their\" is mildly vague as to who it refers to, though your intent is clear. i bring this up, though, because i think the \"their\" includes not just the politicians and media, but the majority of albertans themselves -- they need to take their fair share of the blame: 

* \"their mistake\" being the 55% of albertans who voted the ucp in when it was clear they were brutal (they voted the jokers out 4 years earlier for being corrupt as fuck and for screwing the province for decades, but i guess they learned their lesson, eh).
* \"their mistake\" being the lagging and brutal vaccination rates
* \"their mistake\" being the scads of people who are against lockdowns and masks
* \"their mistake\" being the scads of people who, while many areas of the country were locking down and trying to control thing, were acting as if the pandemic was over (contrary to all medical evidence and warnings from the medical establishment).
* \"their mistake\" being the folks who, in the light of the ucp's evident failures and the long-standing and obvious connections to the federal party, overwhelmingly voted to export their shit to the rest of canada.

**&lt;edit&gt;** yes, i know that alberta is a rich tapestry and there are many types of albertans, but i am discussing the aggregate here, just as the parent poster was discussing the aggregate.**&lt;/edit&gt;**


the funny thing is, the ucp and conservative parties know they can shit on albertans year after year (both provincially and federally), because it seems nothing will change the reflexive conservative vote they have going on. nothing will ever change, because the vote never changes.

i would say that albertans need to take ownership and not just scapegoat the very people that they incessantly vote for year after year; and judging by the recent election and overwhelming support for erin \"[we] can learn a lot from [the] ucp\" o'toole, little has been learned by the majority of them even now.",conservatives

this is an oversimplification at best. different first nations and europeans had a series of good and bad periods throughout the period of colonization. 

new france had good relations with the huron and poor relations with the iroquois. so much so that the iroquois sent diplomats to britain seeking aid against the french. acadians also got along well with the mik'maw it seems.

the english got off to a bad start with the mik'maw (who out-numbered the english) but eventually got into a working relationship until the loyalist arrived and upset the balance.

the hudson bay company got along with the first nations and respected their knowledge and negotiation skills.

unlike a parliamentary committee, a committee of parlimentarians cannot swing around their parliamentary privilege. if trudeau doesn't want them to see something, he can say no. if someone at this dinner party asks to see something, he can say no. or, he can lie to them and say that's all there is when that isn't all there is.

what's ironic about this is that back in 2009, trudeau voted for a motion that reaffirmed the right of parliament to see unredacted documents.

pharmacare was in the 2019 platform, but the pandemic happened and pfizer extorted the vaccines to force them to delay it, pushing for tax breaks instead. this is what made rempel-garner's accusations of pfizer being in the pockets of the liberals so ludicrous. they had canada over a barrel due to lack of manufacturing capacity and were more than willing to exercise \"leverage\" to get what they want.

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-pfizer-pushes-for-tax-breaks-in-2021-federal-budget/

but with the pandemic (possibly?) on the wane and manufacturing capacity being rebuilt after harper and mulroney's cuts, i really would not be surprised to see them bring it back as a possibility now that conditions are more favourable. i know how you feel about lucy and the football, but i really do think trudeau's version is a different kind of lpc. there's that old saying about rome not being built in a day, and putting back together what harper gutted over a decade wasn't going to happen overnight (especially not with so much time and resources of the first term being consumed by the orange elephant downstairs).",liberals

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i would like canadians to have a little grace and honesty in our history. that's all.

well too bad. that went out the window in 2004 when the libs started the practice of attacking the conservatives as bad people, and has just gotten worse till today. and the current habit of people on the left cancel culturing those who try to speak rationally has eliminated any chance of it outside of the political forum.  so you're about 20 years too late for that.

as to this particular topic, what i've said is true. i didn't hype it, and i didn't create the meme which is being passed around left leaning sites right now.

&gt;it's kind of like \"oh, the germans did it, so it's not our guilt to bear\". no, humans did it and it's best to know that we are capable of terrible things.

germans did do it. lying about it or trying to downplay that is dishonest. i thought you were all about the honesty. the fact that germans are human and that other humans might well do the same thing is a perfectly valid point, but yes - the germans did do it. that is a truth. and no - the other peoples' of the world are not responsible for what the germans did. i don't even think that the germans of today are guilty for what the germans of the war did. but those germans are.

it is not my guilt to bear that the germans killed jews in the war. sorry. it's not even my guilt to bear that the residential schools happened. sorry. we may take responsibility for making it right but guilt? no. did you lock up any native kids? me either.

you sure don't sound like someone who believes in personal responsibility and that's kind of the core of conservative thinking. you can see why i have issues with your claim that you're a strongly conservative minded person right?",conservatives

the first nations community is rightfully angry. you read about the death rates at these schools and its hard to describe other than wanton murder. 

and to throw salt in the wound, records by both the government and associated church institutions aren’t being handed over, and the government has you tied up in lawsuits. the catholic church won’t even apologize.

but burning of a place of worship is not the way. and no i’m not disregarding all that was done to the first nations by saying so. someone in r/alberta commented that when the church needed repairs, the local community raised funds for it. i read the cbc article of a member of the church talking about all the memories they had in it.

it’s not the same dynamic because one crime was done by a terrorist organization not tied to the affected place of worship and another is actual structured institution but as a canadian muslim, i relate to the pain of seeing a place of worship attacked, like the peterborough mosque. it hurts to see any place of worship attacked.

edit 1: it was r/edmonton not r/alberta. they mentioned how the recent steeple repairs were locally funded.

edit 2: i think the mods were wrong to do full-on bans in this emotionally charged thread. in my opinions, the mods should have removed individual comments instead of banning people (i know it’s more work for them). i appreciated some of the back and forth even if some of it made me uncomfortable. of course i don’t have a problem with removing comments like “fuck religion, let’s burn down all churches” because of the call to violence but the the mention of artefacts, and the violation indigenous bodies and burial grounds were a beneficial addition to the conversation.",liberals

i'm on the younger end(mid 20s) and my friends who have never voted before are voting liberal.

seeing the prime minister talking to the nation on a near daily basis helps the government. hides all the scandals, which there have been many.

on the side of caution for the liberals, the ndp were polling in minority government territory for the first 1/3 of the election in 2015. then the mulcair promised no debt spending which managed to somehow scare centre-left voters so they shifted to the liberals. then from 2015 to early 2019 the liberals had a poll average of 42%(i believe) then ended up losing the popular vote, but winning the most amount of seats.

edit: i wasn't right in saying \"the same way they now do for television and radio\" - the crtc presently does *not* have the authority to levy monetary penalties; for licensed broadcasters the stick that the crtc wields is the authority to revoke a license. the authority to fine broadcasters (online or \"traditional\") is a new power that bill c-10 would give the crtc.",liberals

it demands that sites which provide content discovery and catalogues of content to view, because broadcast _includes on-demand content_, provide a certain amount of canadian content to canadian viewers.

in a manner of speaking, at the bandwidth level this means that where before packets were whatever was served by the content provider and requested by the user, the content of those packets will change stochastically in response to the regulations. the \"_canadianness_\" of the payload is tipped.

your statistics about quebec looks at the province as a whole. while it’s true the entire province has the overall longest wait times, but regions like montreal specifically who employ these two tiered system do not have such long wait times.

it’s been growing and solving the issue of wait times little by little. 

now don’t mistake my position as purely capitalistic. i think full/near full health coverage for all canadians should be mandatory. under our current system however it can take years to get treatment, and in that time people’s health worsens. 

so how do we add a larger menu of services when we can barely handle the one we have? well we have to target these wait times, and the two tiered system is working for european countries as well as regions like montreal. 

it’s tried and tested; those unwilling to pay won’t have to pay anything more. those who are will pay more and go to a separate private clinic. the queue for those waiting to see a public clinic will shorten, and everyone gets service faster. think about it as instead of raising taxes to hire more health care personnel, you allow people who can afford larger contributions to contribute way higher amounts (~700 per visit). so it’s essentially subsidized more and the income is coming from the rich who can afford to contribute more",liberals

private clinics like that have shorter wait times because of the fact that not everyone can afford to go there. if all those were brought under public ownership, it would be cheaper, and out of pocket expenses would fall down.  


&gt; think about it as instead of raising taxes to hire more health care personnel, you allow people who can afford larger contributions to contribute way higher amounts (\\~700 per visit).

that's the issue, not everyone can afford it, only a very small percentage, the wealthiest, can, and will be able to afford it. the reason why private clinics have short wait times is because of the fact that since not everyone can afford to go there, people go to the public one instead, which overburdens the public system. if all were brought under public system, however, it would still reduce wait times overall. also, we have a very low doctor to patient ratio, we definitely need way more doctors in canada, as it would help reduce wait times in the public system more, and more peeps would get a family doctor.   


&gt;under our current system however it can take years to get treatment, and in that time people’s health worsens.

we have similar wait times to new zealand, a two tiered country. and yes, our wait times can be addressed by a variety of things like:

* pharmacare: this allows people to stop going into clinics to get the medications for free as right now, prescription drugs are not subsidized, meaning they are expensive to people. this also means that since peeps can't afford getting the meds they need, they don't take the meds, meaning they get sicker, and go to the medical facilities, which costs more to the taxpayer system, and overloads the public system.
* dentalcare: our teeth are an integral part of our body, and any damage, infections to them can screw over our entire body. that's why we need universal dental care, with a focus on preventative care, just like pharmacare. if our teeth are in bad shape, it can also affect our mental health, which is bad. 
* mental health: identifying key mental issues as soon as possible, without any cost to the patient, and ensuring that these are treated etc. properly ensures costs are lower, and there is less occupancy of medical facilities. 
* vision and hearing: again, two of our five main senses, and yet they are not covered in our public system universally. these need to be covered so that incoming health issues of peeps are addressed fast, so that they can be treated, and so that it doesn't spiral out of control for their health, and does not cost more to the public system. 
* proper funding: our health care system has been underfunded consistently over the past 40 years due to ideological austerity of each forthcoming government, who either maintained, or cut the spending more, meaning our public system has had less, and less, resources to help provide care. 
* management: reduced bureaucracy, ending ppps (public sector contracting to private sector, which is way too costly) would help our system so much. public services are delivered best by the public sector, when it is properly funded, and managed. 
* shortage of medical staff: we have a very low physician to patient ratio, one of the lowest in the western world. therefore, we need to look towards making it easier and incentivize people to become medically skilled workers, like gps, nurses, surgeons, etc. to do that, we need to make sure it doesn't cost the person their whole life savings to attend medical college. average medical school tuition fee in canada is close to 15k a year. we need to make sure we have interest free loans, more generous grants, and tuition free college, so that it is easier for people to become skilled in this sector, and above all, do not graduate with debt, making it easier for them to participate in providing care to everyone. in addition, we need to raise our physicians' wages, to ensure they get the full fruits of their labor etc. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt; so these private companies wouldn’t have access to publicly hired doctors and they would hire/import th

what's stopping those publicly hired doctors from going full on private if the government chose to cut health care spending more? even with your quotas, peeps can still skip the lines cuz under your system rich would be able to skip the line.

&amp;#x200b;

tldr: proper funding, management, a focus on preventative care, expanded public system coverage, bringing health care in general under public ownership, incentivizes by the govt to have more peeps become medical practitioners in canada would fix our system, not privatization.

they got more seats in ontario and quebec than in the prairies because ontario and quebec have more seats in general, because of population. in ontario they got 37 seats to the liberals 77. in quebec, they got 10 seats to the liberals 35. their terrible showing in the eastern provinces came to 8 seats in total.

the cpc's strongest support is almost entirely concentrated in the prairies, which are becoming less relevant as populations change and more seats are added to urban centers. there is no truth exaggeration here, the cpc shores up in rural prairie ridings to the detriment of everywhere else. if that upsets you too bad, it's the truth that has been discussed for like 3 elections now. gains they make in ontario are when people get tired of the liberals, it's not exactly a stronghold for them, same as quebec.",liberals

[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:drapeau-carillon-sacr%c3%a9-coeur.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:drapeau-carillon-sacr%c3%a9-coeur.jpg)

this flag was infleuenced by the discovery of the flag you mentioned (it's use as a battle flag is disputed), but as you can see, the catholic cross, absent from the original flag,  was added to reinforce the religious meaning. the current quebec flag is much more like the more recent religious flag.

the fleur-de-lys is a very old french catholic symbol representing the virgin mary. it doesn't even grow in quebec.

[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33597](https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=33597)

nothing wrong with that. it's important that our public symbols reflect the religious aspects of our province. i would just like to leave room for jews, muslims, sikhs, protestant, and orthodox christians as well  as well as catholics. nova scotia has the cross of saint andrew, and montreal has the cross of saint george at it's middle. ireland (and montreal) include the shamrock, and irish catholic symbol of saint patrick and a symbol of the holy trinity. the golden pine at the center of the montreal flag is a mohawk reliigous symbol. this is my version of secularism: include the relgious symbols of all founding peoples.",liberals

they've been promising pharmacare on and off for years. a few years ago they made a pledge for pharmacare and advertised it to the world. in reality it was a working group to study how to eventually implement pharmacare, and we've seen no updates or funding for pharmacare in the years since. several budgets and throne speeches have gone by without even a mention of pharmacare. all the liberals point to is an agreement they made with pei on expanding pei's drug coverage to match what other maritime provinces were already offering, and they frame that as the first step towards pharmacare. and if that really was the first step, it's notable that we've now gone several years since without seeing step two.

electoral reform is a pretty clear example of the liberals promising something then cynically reneging on it. they promised reform and were deliberately vague about what they wanted in order to get support from people who want proportional representation. then in government they finally announced that they want a system that literally no one else has ever called for, then feigned shock when the committee that they refused to work with couldn't come to a consensus. (and as a side note, the other user who responded to your comment has dismissed this issue entirely, asserts that the liberals never implied they would bring in proportional representation, and describes electoral reform advocates as pr \"militants\")

and lastly childcare. it's wonderful that the liberals are working on this. it's certainly an achievement they deserve credit for. but that doesn't mean people shouldn't be cynical or skeptical, because the liberals have been promising childcare for 30 years. they had majorities for a decade through the 90s and only began work on childcare once their power became precarious. when scandal took down their first minority government they blamed everyone else for childcare never happening, as if none of their scandals ever happened. and now trudeau didn't touch childcare for his entire majority government, and only began rolling out the childcare agreements with provinces in the lead up to the election that they themselves called before childcare could be finished rolling out. if they hadn't won that election childcare would again be in the toilet, and i can only assume it would be someone else's fault but the liberal party's for not trying to create a childcare system sooner.",liberals

while i sympathize with the green party (climate change is my #1 issue and a big reason for my support for trudeau and the liberals), i would observe that whenever it comes to a concrete project proposal, the green party has a strong tendency to say no. any project will have environmental and social impacts and risks, so it's difficult to say yes. the catch-22 is, dealing with the climate crisis is going to require a lot of big changes.

it may seem strange to say that the green party has a bias towards preserving the status quo, but here's some examples:

in vancouver there's a massive shortage of housing (especially rental housing), and in municipal politics the big fight is always over building more housing. there's three green councillors, with adrianne carr the most well-known. they've voted no a disappointing number of times on rental projects. for example, there was [a 6-5 vote to approve a rental tower](https://www.straight.com/news/vancouver-city-council-narrowly-approves-rezoning-for-258-secured-rental-units-in-tower-on) on a major transit corridor, on the site of a former denny's (so there's no tenant displacement); two of the three green councillors voted no.

she also criticized kenney for his cancel culture comments:

&gt;“changing the names of schools and educating people about these atrocities is not “cancel culture.” cancel culture is what has happened to our first nations by not acknowledging these atrocities and those responsible.”

another cabinet minister, rajan sawhney, who has also been following the health restrictions, made similar comments on the radio this weekend about the sky palace dinner.

this follows back bench mla angela pitt calling out the sky palace dinner and calling for an immediate loosening of the health restrictions.

he has already kicked out mlas who had publicly opposed the health restrictions.

you also have a lot of riding associations demanding an early leadership review (kenney has scheduled one for less than six months before the next election).

i have been saying for awhile now, after klein, the alberta pcs morphed into the federal liberal party, spending freely, not increasing taxes but simply running up the debt.  the klein pcs were horrified by this and broke off into the wildrose party which became like the federal reform party.

you can't merge the liberal and reform parties...it just doesn't work.  up until now, the public problems have come from the far conservative wing of the party.  now they are coming from the centrist wing of the party.

the far right of the party is publicly criticizing him, the centrist wing of the party is publicly criticizing him and a lot of riding associations want a leadership review now!  kenney's days as leader are numbered and, without him, i don't believe the ucp can last.

&gt; it's crazy people seeking treatment have to drive so far and put up for a hotel room but that's been the reality in nb for a long time.

canada has a chronic underfunding issue in regards to our healthcare. this is a problem i see all over the country, even in more populous provinces. once you start driving in ontario, up highway 17 past renfrew, or driving north, or west past sudbury, access to healthcare of all kinds gets harder and harder. i would go so far as to call it one of the greatest inequalities that we need to solve in our country, and in my personal opinion we're going to need to get creative about it - nurse practitioners, telehealth, zoom dr's calls, city-to-city funded transport for health reasons, etc etc.

i should note that this power is somewhat a necessary evil because the provinces have some of the most expensive sectors under their jurisdiction (healthcare, transportation, education) and yet lower tax revenue than the feds.  the provinces could significantly increase their taxes, forcing the federal government lower theirs, but that would require collective action amongst many provincial governments.

it's highly likely that this federal spending power would fail if it ever got challenged in court. nowhere in the constitution does it give the federal government these extensive powers.  a judicial ruling from the 1930s specifically stated that the federal government can not use federal money to regulate issues of provincial jurisdiction.  but so far, the courts have not heard a formal challenge on the topic, so it's one of canada's largest constitutional 'grey areas'.  everyone knows it's probably unconstitutional and regardless definitely a violation of the original federal system, but no one wants to expend political capital on changing it.",conservatives

thats why i compare it to isreal, because the isrealli government commits war atrocities but obviously one should be able to fight back against the israeli power structure.

h9iwlo0,2021-08-18T22:26:43.000-07:00,"erin o’toole is right that life is getting more expensive. but his proposed solutions would make things worse. it was also pierre trudeau that, under the direction of the international bank of settlements and the basil commission, shifted our monetary policy from interest-free bonds being issued by the bank of canada, to every dollar printed requiring a bond from a private bank with interest. from 1970s to the 1990s our national debt ballooned from $20bn to $410bn or so with over 90% being \"due to cover past interest\". 

here's the audit, chapter 5 of the 1993 auditor general's report:

https://web.archive.org/web/20140304193332/http://www.oag-bvg.gc.ca/internet/english/parl_oag_199312_05_e_5944.html

&gt; 5.41 the cost of borrowing is the third area that affects the annual deficit. in 1991-92, the interest on the debt was $41 billion. this cost of borrowing and its compounding effect have a significant impact on canada's annual deficits. from confederation up to 1991-92, the federal government accumulated a net debt of $423 billion. of this, $37 billion represents the accumulated shortfall in meeting the cost of government programs since confederation. **the remainder, $386 billion, represents the amount the government has borrowed to service the debt created by previous annual shortfalls**.

trudeau senior sentenced us to a wealth transfer through deficit spending to pay for interest payments. i know he had little choice as all countries were forced to do the same in the preceding 30 years, but still.

&gt; the basel committee’s solution to the “stagflation” problem of that time was to encourage governments to borrow from private banks, that charged interest, and end the practice of borrowing interest-free from their own publicly owned banks. their argument was that publicly owned banks inflate the money supply and prices, whereas chartered banks supposedly only recycle pre-existing money. what they purposefully suppressed was that private banks create the money they lend just as public banks do. and as banking specialist ellen brown states:

&gt; the difference is simply that a publicly-owned bank returns the interest to the government and the community, while a privately-owned bank siphons the interest into its capital account, to be reinvested at further interest, progressively drawing money out of the productive economy.

i'm acadian mi'kmaq, my family survived genocide on both sides. this isn't as foreign a concept as we'd like to believe it is. 

a quick look around the world shows exactly what happens to countries who's populace isn't armed. it's not something that \"used to happen\", it's still happening in countries where the populace have no power to defend themselves. authoritarians in hong kong, religious fanatics in afghanistan, cartels in mexico, etc.

we are a very large country with a very small populace and an even smaller military that canadians haven't been properly funding. if our military were to fall our people would be absolutely defenseless and be begging for the us to save us(provided its not some dystopic far right american government responsible.)

life in 2021 is peaceful, but the point of being prepared is not for the world we live in now, but the world we might find ourselves in in the future.

 climate change is going to tear this world apart, other nations are going to be looking at canada with our fresh water and geographic advantage as an opportunity for themselves. 

i want every man, woman, and child to be able to defend themselves and put up a fighting chance if our government were to fall.

now, this doesn't mean just hand out guns. i want proper training to be a requirement, as well as mental health checks.
