a comparison to australia in this regard points to the lack regulation and inspections, and clearly enforcement as being the main issues in ontario.   in australia, they will close a home down if there are repeated ongoing issues, in ontario, they remain open - in part because there aren't enough spaces to place people.    so not only do we need to adopt better regulations, and invest in more inspectors and actually enforce the regulations, ontario needs more beds so that in the event that a home should be shut down, the residents have somewhere to go.    the problem in ontario is not the funding model - other jurisdictions with private funding models didn't do worse than jurisdictions with public funded models.",liberals

it's not all china and russia, though. facebook and google are american as apple pie, and they are thrilled to make us dumber, angrier, and more paranoid, all while keeping us from quality information. i typed it out earlier, so i'm just going to reiterate-

there was a bigger consensus that experts and canadians wanted a proportional system than there has been consensus for any prime minister in my lifetime. the \"no consensus\" line was a paper thin cop out to cover the fact that canadians (and experts) wanted a more representative system and trudeau just wanted a system which would elect more liberals. 

trudeau could have followed the commissions recommendations and still had plenty of influence into the system we would adopt. urban-rural proportional, mmp, multi-member stv, stephane dione's p3 plan - all would have satisfied the conditions of the commission and left canada with a modern electoral system that accurately  represented the views of the electorate for the first time. irv was the only system considered that *wouldn't* do that, so of course it was what trudeau preferred and when it was overwhelmingly rejected by experts and canadians he called the whole reform thing off.",liberals

h2liuik,2021-06-21T10:12:57.000-07:00,"canadian unions break with trudeau lol that is not how card certification works. there are laws in place for this type of harassment. what the article describes is literal fear mongering. of you have personal experience in this please let me know. or give me some links.

for example, the union rep first needs to get permission from the employee if they wanted to be contacted and then it is totally up to them to decide if they want to sign. no one can force you to sign that card. 

if another employee harass a co worker there are procedures in place. for example you can complain to you manager or hr. these are taken very seriously by the employer. 

if i were to be more nuanced i can say that the employee can sue the employer if they abuse you. most likely the employee will  win. however, the employer will succeed in squashing any support for unions outright. 

this happened in my workplace. people pointed to a person that got fired (he won the court case) and refused to sign the cards. fortunately, there was enough brave people to sign the card certification. you know whats funny the people that didn't sign the card voted yes in the secret ballot (100% of people voted yes) (more people voted than signed cards) 

its not that i don't agree with secret ballots. problem is that the employee and employer relationship is already tilted towards the employer. 

a simple way to even the playing field. if the employee has a history of abuse there will be no secret ballot only card certification. (this still is inadequate because some poor employee will get hurt for others to have rights).

not everyone deserves representation in government. full stop. criminals don't deserve the power to make policy to affect society. full stop. 

if democracy is gonna yeild an inferior output than autocracy, then its time to ditch democracy. 

we have govt to serve the people best. not an exercise in some ideological how things should be, even if they don't work. 

disenfranchise capitalists ? sure. lets also do that with the socialists, given that its socialism that has given the world's largest mandmade disaster, not capitalists ( aral sea disaster). 

there is nothing baffling in my stance. my stance in politics is simple - it is serious business, not a fantasy world and as such, ends always justify the means. ie, whatever yeilds a superior outcome is automatically better. be it democracy or dictatorship.   
and the version of democracy that gives more power to the nazis is automatically worse. due to results. its just that simple. 

and i dont think you have lived in an autocracy to really be a good judge of the merits and demerits of the democratic vs autocratic systems. i have. perhaps that is why i am keen on a democratic system that works and not 'hurrr durrr accept more hitler coz its what people want' type of nonsense.",liberals

the bill seeks to create a state of secularism and equality in quebec. however, although it appears to put people on equal footing, in reality it does the exact opposite for some members of its society. secularism does not mean abolish all symbols of religion, but rather the separation of religion from state practice and influence. although appearing to be separated from religiosity, secularism is as much of a belief system as any other religion. the government of quebec is forcefully imposing its own worldview on its citizens as it seeks to diminish the worldviews of others.",liberals

to be completely honest with you and as someone who is a progressive conservative (who doesn't really want to see a bill abortion wise) i don't think they will if they won an election. o'toole is in a unique and tricky position. he is a progressive but also has to throw meat to his base. allowing a private member bill everyone knows isn't going to pass and is rather tame (in regards to abortion and general opinion of canadians) throws meat to the base and doesn't stir up a whole hell of a lot of shit. following o'toole throw the leadership race and afterwards i've found that this guy is a political tactician. he understands the voter base (a big tent) and figured out how to get enough votes to beat one of the founding members of the cpc, who litterally came back to politics to lead the party (i'm talking of course about peter mackay). after he won he turned on a dime to being progressive.

&gt;just like they officially voted to deny climate change is real.

this vote was done by delegates and not mps. they're typical voters. the ndp delegates voted to abolish the canadian armes forces but i don't hold it against the ndp because i know that vote was equally as meaningless as the climate change vote.

you understand that what trump did on jan. 6 - it's like grabbing the football and running it down the opposite end of the field and scoring a game-changing point for your enemies.

it was insane, is what i'm saying. trump is so clearly trying to sabotage all of america's interests and light as many fires as he can.

if obama was doing this, i'd assume he was probably being mind controlled by the russians somehow or *really was* a kenyan muslim sleeper cell.

or, more likely, trump is sleeper cell. why would he be so fixated on overturning his election loss despite winning 74-million votes, the second-highest in us history?

trump also claimed obama's 2012 re-election victory over mitt romney was somehow stolen.

**trump tweeted this in 2012, ten years ago**

&gt;let's fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! the world is laughing at us.
&gt;
&gt;this election is a total sham and a travesty. we are not a democracy!
&gt;
&gt;our nation is a once great nation divided!

&gt;our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble...like never before.

he has called for law and order with justice and equality for all. that sounds like a good idea to me.

i agree the dems messaging hasn't been great. but i also see the democrats are learning message discipline finally.

they still have the firebrands, but the majority of democrats have backed biden's stance on police.

we got to rebuild trust between people and police.

we can't have the president of the united states rage tweeting protestors and pressuring his military generals to invade the streets and shoot protesters.

do you remember that? trump was publicly pressuring his military to go to war in the streets over blm. that's insane.

the military publicly rejected trump's demands for \"martial law\" saying they were an occupying force, not a peace-keeping one and that soldiers in the streets would be a combat mission and result in serious death.

martial law is a measure of last resort, and trump was openly pushing everyone for it to happen.

dems are not perfect, but this is just freakishly insane.

i don't know why republicans normalized all of trump blatantly self-destructive behavior.

nothing about the last six years has made any sense in american politics. trump is a total freak and aberration, like nothing we've ever seen in our history.

really. name them. provide proof of that. i betcha they weren't :) 

&gt;uh, yeah it is.

uh nope - no it isn't. they slap a quick fix on and the advisory gets pulled only to reoccur later. that's common. 

 &gt;so yeah, they've spent 5.2 billion in 6 years

4 billion you said. and how much of that is actually spent and how much is 'scheduled' to be spent? more of it than you think. 

so nope. fail.they really don't care.

&gt;here lies the issue that you don't get: how the fuck do you supply a rural reserve with a sparse, spread out population with consistently clean drinking water? 

two points:

first, the answer is pipes. lots of pipes. perhaps not surprisingly pipes have been used to deliver water now for many many many decades. it's a time tested solution :)  there's lots of reserves like that, there's lots of rural areas like that. you lay pipes. (let me know if you need me to send you a picture, you seem unfamiliar with the concept of 'pipes')

and two - if it's impossible as you say to get water from the brand new processing plant to the people...  why the fuck build a new plant? why spend the millions and millions when according to you it's obvious that it's impossible to use the plant to get water to anyone?

there's really no way to spin it other than they don't give a shit. either you're full of it (which is most likely) and they could deliver the water services but they just didn't plan for it or fund it, or it's impossible as you say which means they didn't even give a shit enough to actually look into it before they signed a cheque to shut them the fuck up. 

either way - they just don't give a shit. and nothing is being done now. and as noted there's many examples. 

sorry - other than to virtue signal a little here and there and make a few photo ops, the liberals don't give a flying shit about the issue or the first nations. 

 i mean - it's not like he hides the fact he doesn't give a shit:

hf0ubys,2021-10-01T07:30:01.000-07:00,"toronto loses bid at supreme court of canada to overturn doug ford’s cut to city council &gt; ah yeah. from your post history, it seems like you're from alberta. the alberta legislature has 87 mlas. (ontario has 124 mpps and 3x the population. metropolitan toronto has 67% of the population of alberta. on a per capita basis toronto based on alberta's distribution, toronto should have 58 councillors. 47 seems like a lot to a lot of people who have never been here or understand how large the city is.

what does the provincial legislature have to do with the municipal government? they have different mandates and completely different expectations. we can spin this another way, if toronto covered an area of 662,000 square kilometers they would need 87 councilors. they aren't two things you can compare directly to each other. 

calgary has 1.4 million population and only 14 councilors in their city. vancouver has 2.5 million and only has 10! montreal at 4 million has 64 councilors which is still more residents per councilor than toronto was at. 


&gt;as much as toronto has been dysfunctional for a while, it's dysfunctional because (mostly) conservative premiers have stepped in (amalgamation) in the governance of the city to further their ambitions (because everyone who doesn't live here hates it and thinks it's a giant suckhole despite the fact toronto is more responsible for canadian economic growth than alberta as a whole is).


i am so confused by this statement. ontario has had a liberal government for 15 years up until 2019. how on earth are you blaming conservatives for anything?

toronto has the financial district of canada that drives 90% of toronto's economic contribution. the rest is manufacturing, which for the most part resides in the gta, but for some reason is still counted as toronto. alberta with one third the population of ontario is the 3rd largest economic driver. i am really confused on this \"this gdp is bigger than their gdp\" comment, its completely irrelevant.",conservatives

i am personally not in favor open carry, i don’t see the need for that. i briefly looked over the guardian article you sent and it seems to be mainly focusing on the effects of seeing a gun. i favor concealed carry or keeping it my home because the purpose to me is to be able to use my gun under lawfully justifiable circumstances, not draw attention to myself or intimidate others. also, the deeper problem here seems to be the psychological response to guns. constant media portrayal of guns as evil as opposed to simply being dangerous tools that must be respected, plays a role in the way we feel when we see a gun.

hm2s2xc,2021-11-25T04:46:21.000-08:00,"canada pm trudeau says he is extremely concerned by soaring cost of living counterpoint: policy makers took dramatic measures to avoid a bad covid-19-induced recession. that goal was successfully achieved.

those measures were not without tradeoffs, however. fiscal support and low interest rates increase demand, increasing the quantity of economic activity (what we want) and consumer prices (what we don’t want). policy makers are now bound to the commitments they made in early 2020, or they will lose much of the credibility that makes economic stimulus measures effective. 

that’s on the national side. on the international side, global supply chains have been heavily disrupted (by covid-19 too, if it weren’t obvious). a negative supply shock decreases economic activity *and* raises prices. both bad. supply chains are the reason we’re seeing inflation everywhere in the world, not just here in canada. these things will adjust over time, though, particularly as covid-19 ceases to be a problem.

i’m personally not too worried about inflation—yes, it sucks right now, but extra fiscal support is scheduled to slow down at the end of 2022q1, and end mid-2022. the boc has already ended its quantitative easing (bond-buying) program, and is expected to gradually raise interest rates throughout next year. these things need to be gradual, because policy makers worry that shifting their stance too quickly could accidentally induce another recession.

i will start to worry about inflation if one of two things happens: 1) regular people expect inflation to persist long-term—inflation expectations can often become a self-fulfilling prophecy; 2) the government changes its mind and keeps extending fiscal support long after it’s needed.

(one minor quibble with your comment: the boc is not the authoritative arm of the government. rather, it is a politically independent central bank and crown corporation whose long-term mandate is set in agreement with the government. being at an arm’s length from the government means that its policy decisions are set by technocrats with phds. justin trudeau doesn’t have the power to say “hey i don’t like what you’re doing, change it right now,” whereas he does when it comes to finance canada.)",liberals

at the same time set up a longer process to work on the supply issues and find ways to get that to trickle down to municipalities.  build programs designed to train people to build houses, create government built rental property with an aim to provide consistent sustainable industry of building rental to meet the supply needs.  look at how we can reformulate our tax breaks and laws that are supposed to incentives private industry to build rental stock.  on the accute supply side, we should take some immediate actions to create a space for more tiny living in the rules and building codes, as well as looking at issues like short term rentals (aka air bnb) and university housing/accommodations.

the worst possible outcome would be that for legal reasons, the topic is basically banned with therapists, leaving people to deal with it on their own, which can be very difficult for some people.

transitioning genders could be impacted in the same way.

edit: to provide some more info, i'm in ontario. therapists fall under crpo which is regulated on this subject but with a lighter hand. you can't treat those who can't give consent.... basically you can do conversion therapy to people, even minors, but they have to give fully informed consent, and all the normal therapy regulations still apply. and of course, modern training is all about affirmation of gender, not conversion. i doubt any rpt is doing this sort of therapy either way.

realistically, what little conversion therapy happens in canada is happening in churches. the law should be written to be in line with psychotherapy standards, or simply target the churches.

forcing a child to be one way or the other should simply count as child abuse and then we just use existing laws on those lines.",liberals

for example (these are just random numbers to show the idea) they give every canadian 1500/month (18000/year) taxed. you're allowed to earn an additional 15000 in income before ubi begins clawing back (27000k which is slightly below median income). between 27k-45k ubi will claw back to zero (at tax time). this method would incentivize work, as you would not be losing benefits early. after 45k, ubi would be clawed back at tax time. the government then could incentivize deductions for the higher brackets in-order to offset the claw back. giving back more ubi to social programs, etc. 

as someone with multiple businesses and a higher income i would probably use my ubi to lower my overall tax burden come tax time. i could donate it, hire people for part time labour (hire a part time assistant), invest in an asset to create more income off the ubi, etc.",liberals

canada has only ever had one coalition government post confederation , in 1919 (which is stresssing the definition actually, as only some liberals crossed the floor). and in terms of minority governments formed by a party that got the second most seats , that happened just in 1925. 

the 2009 attempt to form a coalition government never actually happened since harper prorogued parliament. 

so no, it is not “literally” what we have now. and the cpc winning the most seats without a majority does not automatically lead to a liberal government. the other parties have not indicated they’d support a liberal attempt to form a cabinet, and it is traditionally not done. it’s very rare, as i just showed with only one example federally (it’s happened a bit more recently at the provincial level). it is true that trudeau will have the right to attempt it form a government first, but there is no definitely guarantee the other parties would buck tradition and support him in that endeavour.",liberals

well again you lose me with saying numbers (government debt) are fictional.  i suppose your one of the mmt types (generally a left wing government economics stance).

*the carbon tax as done by the liberals has been hailed as the best and simplest solution by actual economists. yes not fraiser institute hacks, but by actual nkn bias economists. remember, the simple carbon tax is a conservative plan.*

the fraser institute is one of the larger think tanks in canada.  generally they are considered right of center.  it's probably polarized to say they're hacks (the equivalent of a right winger saying a left of center think tank like the canadian centre for policy alternatives are a bunch of hacks.  tbh they both make some pretty good points (and have made, and will make more mistakes in the future).   if \"numbers are fictional\" (government economics) does a carbon tax really work (obviously being facetious here)...  the truth is there are economists on the left and right that valid criticisms (from both left/right think tanks).

think tank analysis: 

1. [https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/environmental-faith/tapp/](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/environmental-faith/tapp/)
2. [https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/think-tanks-fill-an-important-niche-within-canadas-public-policy-landscape/](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/think-tanks-fill-an-important-niche-within-canadas-public-policy-landscape/)

*additionally the bi lateral nature kf the liberal plan is again a conservative way of doing things with each province having the ability to direct the carbon tax as it meets federal objectives.. same as the liberal child care plan, if someone has any regard for provincial autonomy what the liberals have done is by far the best way to do it. federal standards, provincial needs.*

i would mostly agree with this, although as of the last couple months its been shown that the liberals haven't been bilateral with the tax.  they have let some provinces implement the carbon tax one way, while denying other provinces wanting to do the same thing:

https://www.sasktoday.ca/south/opinion/letter-federal-government-should-treat-saskatchewan-fairly-4173970

*the cpc plan is... odd, its hugely burocratic and inefficent as compared to the liberals, additionally it helps the rich far more then the poor. so when staples like groceries increase in cost due to carbon taxes, the poor suffer far more under the cpc plan, while those well off like myself get to use credits to buy green home improvments and evs.*

i would again disagree with this.  under the current lpc plan i'm seeing essentially a tax rebate (which arguably could just be spend on things like gas after, creating a circle jerk):

https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2020/12/climate-action-incentive-payment-amounts-for-2021.html

also (lpc incentives right now, and in my case in bc) i see things like rebates for things like heat pumps, ev's, solar panels, and insulating my house (poor people don't deal with these things).  the rest under the lpc plan is going to bureaucratic heavy institutions like schools, municipal government etc (ever see 4 municipal workers doing a 1 man job?).  and on the bureaucratic side (house reno side) i have to have my house checked before and after by some energy specialist (with questionable training).

under the cpc plan you can spend your money on things like a transit pass (more likely to be used by less fortunate canadians), while also remaining more competitive with our neighbors to the south and the rest of the world (in our capitalism run world being competitive matters (numbers are real) ) because of the $50 per tonne cap in their plan  

again if the cpc get in power (highly unlikely) i hope this cap would be variable (not $50 forever) because inflation is real ($50 won't be enough forever) and climate change needs attention.  its all about a proper balance though, too much of a carbon tax increases inflation (eg. lpc future $170 per tonne) and inflation disproportionately effects the poor, perhaps to your surprise (while pads the pockets of the rich, see what's happened to the riches during this pandemic)  
  
*we are the 3rd worst polluter in the world. we need to pay enouf to bring that down to close to the bottom.* 

your somewhat correct here, although something to take into consideration is most countries with colder climates use more carbon than their peers in warmer climates.  i have mixed feelings on this. 

*of that means a carbon tax of $300/t then so be it. now im.not stuipid, a gradual ramling of the tax is the only way to get there without shocking the economy. but we need to get there. as carbon tax is the number one fairest way of reducing emissioms in a market driven economy.*

and this is the proverbial \"million dollar question\" that economists from the left and right can't agree on (from hacks at the fraiser institute and ccpa).  the key is not to shock the economy too much (increasing poverty) but do something to deal with the problem; find the quiescent point.  

*as for fuel costs, so? i bought a vehicle that is 3x more efficent then my last one. so compared to the average vehicle kn the road im still spending less then most americans even if they have cheaper prices. oh and my co2 emissions are 1/3 as well. the market has decided to incentivise me to do this... which is the entire point of the carbon tax...*

this has helped you because it enabled you to buy an electric car (i will be following suit soon hopefully).  i agree on this, but still sympathize with the poor or young that cannot afford an electric car and have to buy 1.70 gas to go to work... problems mentioned above (problem of inflation etc.)

*oh i dont think the lpc is good, bill c10 really grinds my gears. i just trust the cpc. none, i live in alberta where the same people who are in the cpc are destroying this province.*

i agree bill c10 is disgusting.  i voted lpc in 2015 (go weed) but after all the scandal's these last 2 terms, the essentially doubling of the national debt (no end in sight) and spending more than rest of the g20 during the pandemic (and at this point having job boards looking for people, with high unemployment numbers), i couldn't possibly vote for more of the same.

yeah big gut randy in 'berta is pretty unpopular, and the ucp party is fracturing again.  still a misnomer to think a provincial party and a federal party are the same (see bc liberals and federal liberals for example).",liberals

i may be showing my age, but we used to call these 'john manley liberals.'

&gt;eventually we get to a point where these two groups meet face to face, and it gets really weird, contradictory, and virtue signally.

this dynamic has been playing out since at least the 1980s. lpc supporters (and democrats, in the us) seem surprisingly comfortable with the tension:

&gt;most liberals, like most americans, preferred not to regard capitalists as categorically rapacious and amoral, or to imagine the u.s. political economy as a never-ending struggle in which everyone must ultimately choose between two sides. that seemed crude. they didn’t vote for reagan, but most didn’t hate him, certainly not at first, because in their way they shared his dreamy faith in the 1940s frank capra movie vision of america. and to some degree, most liberals succumbed, like most americans, to a new form of economic nostalgia that was being revived and popularized—the notion that market forces are practically natural forces with which we dare not tinker or tamper too much. finally, affluent liberals didn’t want to think badly of all their nice friends and neighbors and classmates who happened to work at banks or in real-estate development or in the vicinity of c-suites.

&gt;[...] 

&gt;like most people in my milieu, i always voted for democrats, and i wasn’t *anti*-union or *anti*-welfare or *anti*-government. the probability that elected democrats would tend to increase my taxes wasn’t a reason i voted for them, but my indifference to the financial hit felt virtuous, low-end noblesse oblige. however, even after the right got its way on the political economy around 1980, many people like me weren’t viscerally skeptical of business or wall street either. big businesses—various media and entertainment companies—paid me well and treated me fine, which probably didn’t sharpen my skepticism toward a political economy that was being reordered to help big business (and people like me). when it came to the millions of losers, i felt grateful that *my* work couldn’t be automated or offshored or outsourced, and i thought, *creative destruction, invisible hand, yada yada,* and voted for politicians who said we should retrain steelworkers to become computer programmers.

&gt;although very few people i knew voted for reagan, affluent college-educated people, liberals and otherwise, tended not to disagree ferociously about politics in the 1980s and ’90s, and certainly not about economics. in retrospect, the rough consensus about economics looks like the beginning of an unspoken decades-long class solidarity among the bourgeoisie. affluent college-educated people, democrats as well as republicans, began using the phrase *socially liberal but fiscally conservative* to describe their politics, which meant low taxes for higher-net-worth individuals (another new term) in return for tolerance of . . . *whatever*, as long as it didn’t involve big new social programs that affluent people would have to pay for. it was a libertarianism lite that kept everything nice and clubbable and it did at least have the virtue of ideological consistency.
