you can see each day which bills are actually being debated, and you may notice that some claims of bills being held up aren't actually for bills on the paper for that day.

edit: what's extra egregious is that the government has not put the bill to ban conversion therapy on the order paper at all yet this year, nor the bill to implement undrip. we are now in march of 2021, and there has been no debate on either as they simply haven't scheduled it. if we go into an election and they die on the table without getting passed again it's obviously deliberate. i don't understand how anyone, even someone who supports the party, can justify that.",liberals

note that canada's political system derives from one based on parliamentary sovereignty. referendums are worth exactly nothing legally or constitutionally. parliament and legislative assemblies are not bound by the vote of a referendum, even if a law says so, the law can just be modified to say otherwise.

in the british parliamentary system, there is not even a thing as judicial review of an act of parliament. all acts of parliament are considered to have the same validity as a constitutional amendment and courts have no right to invalidate them. trudeau's charter was a revolution or a coup that gave ultimate power to a supreme court named unilaterally by the federal prime minister and which nomination procedure is protected from modification by an amending process that has never been successful. this was a huge power grab by the federal government, and so many provincial premiers insisted on a notwithstanding clause to be able to resist the opinion of federal judges chosen personally by the federal prime minister.",liberals

it can't. i know, because stephen harper tried to get one and couldn't. the case was *harper v. canada*, and is a good example of the effectiveness of s.1. 

the only counterbalance to s.33 that we have is the wholly inadequate one, laughably inadequate when i think of it, that people would care and be upset if a government started applying it frivolously or for partisan gain. 

i mean, it was only a matter of time. 

i think ontario needs to do two things:

1) amend our provincial constitution to make it harder to use s.33. it should require a 2/3 majority with confirming referenda (yes, plural is intentional) for use beyond 5 years.

2) get ready for the unintended consequences when the right wing discovers turn around is fair play. the rights that protect unions are the same that protect religious institutions, for example, that many on the left would love to force to comply with human rights codes - amongst other \"rights\" conservatives hold dear. once the seal is broken, and s.33 becomes just another legislative tool, if i were a right wing religious type i'd start getting real nervous about the popularity of loi 21 outside of quebec and the popularity of restricting religious liberties and conservative causes in general.

very excited for the ndp bill to shut down canada christian college once and for all, for a start. oh, and maybe we can finally end all of those upsetting anti-abortion demonstrations. i mean, you think safe space rules on universities are restrictive now? i am very excited to see where this goes.

you're going to get a kick out of this,

[the whole reason there's a limit on corporate money was because wynne and olp ministers were holding pay-to-play fundraisers with ceos, business owners, developers, unions, and more.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/investigation-reveals-likely-guests-for-ontario-liberal-cash-for-access-fundraisers/article30783097/)

from that article:

&gt; development and construction companies ‚Äì and their unions ‚Äì show donations that correspond with about 30 events between 2013 and 2015. the fundraisers ranged from evening cocktails in winter to garden parties in summer, and included at least three $10,000-a-ticket evenings with ms. wynne. among the major players with contributions that match the timing and cost of events are daniels corp. ceo mitchell cohen, diamond corp., ellisdon corp., metrus development, zzen developments, and more than a dozen locals of the carpenters‚Äô union. the degasperis family, high-profile members of the development and construction industry, made donations that correspond to three $5,000 tickets to an event on dec. 4, 2014, with mr. sousa. **vaughan developer solmar made donations through five different subsidiaries that correspond with six tickets to two fundraisers with transportation minister steven del duca.**

emphasis is mine, because it's pretty neat to see the new olp leader was involved with cash-for-access events with wealthy and high-profile developers.

anyways, this revelation obviously went over like a lead balloon with voters, and wynne decided that limiting corporate money would net her more votes than allowing corporate money. [that's why she created the limits on 3rd party spending.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario-overhauls-campaign-finance-rules/article33121202/)


as for donation limits, the [provincial limit](https://www.elections.on.ca/en/political-financing0/eligible-contributions.html#accordioncontributionlimits2020) is now the same as the [federal limit](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;document=index&amp;dir=lim&amp;lang=e).

in canada, reports from stats canada have shown a marked deterioration in the economic success of immigrants as the numbers have risen. right now the only group which really performs well are the primary applicants in the economic class. bear in mind that with our progressive tax system if you don't make pretty good money you aren't paying even enough to the government to offset what it lays out in services for you. that's particularly so if you have kids and are getting child benefits. so logically, the only immigrants who are going to help are young and skilled. but we don't focus on that. in fact, the liberals doubled the number of elderly immigrants who can be sponsored after the last election - after doubling them prior to that as well. these immigrants are eligible for free health care, and once here ten years, for oas. family class immigrants perform worse and of course, refugees perform even worse than them. and the liberals are upping the number of refugees (after upping them previously), and also bringing in more family class, while at the same time r[elaxing the requirements for skilled class.](https://www.cdhowe.org/intelligence-memos/mahboubi-skuterud-%e2%80%93-economic-reality-check-canadian-immigration-part-ii)",liberals

the crtc, like all other government agencies, has incentives not to do flagrantly unconstitutional things. for one: the ensuing headaches.

 people imagining that their basic anti-trudeau posts or whatever are now going to be censored are full of shit, imo. if it's charter-protected speech, the crtc will almost certainly leave it alone. if they don't, they *will* be challenged and will probably lose. 

if government agencies were so ready to heavy-handedly use their powers, we would be seeing many more prosecutions for \"wilful promotion of hatred,\" which is a criminal offence in canada. shit's everywhere. by your logic, we'd be seeing cops and prosecutors, if not courts, bullying people who just expressed controversial but not necessarily hateful opinions. 

i'm no scc justice, but i don't think this legislation is itself likely to be found unconstitutional. regulatory actions of the crtc could foreseeably be, however. court decisions going forward will presumably refine and make clearer the scope of freedom of expression in canadian constitutional law.

i‚Äôll have to take your word for it. i don‚Äôt recall him spending much time or making much effort to win seats there. 

&gt;he also never showed up in my riding, even though it's a more likely ndp seat, and has been ndp in the past.

what riding? 

&gt; also he lost saskatchewan because of the whole stuff with weir, otherwise he might of held onto their 3 seats.

while the weir debacle didn‚Äôt help the ndp in saskatchewan, it is not why they lost. they lost because the province swung hard to the conservatives due to the other parties support for a carbon tax/perceived lack of support for the oil and gas industry. 

&gt; brampton is unwinnable for him now since the hindus don't like him because of his support of separatism

brampton has a huge sikh population. it also has 3 ndp mpps. like i said before, it may be a long shot but it‚Äôs not unwinnable. 


&gt; also the only close toronto riding last time was because andrew cash was very popular in davenport, otherwise i don't see them picking it up

true, cash‚Äôs name recognition definitely helped in davenport. but to say the ndp can‚Äôt pick up seats in toronto is ridiculous. 

&gt; also northern ontario would requires a more traditional ndp leader to win, like hampton, horwath or layton, not a leader like singh who mostly focuses on social issues, instead of inequality

one of those leaders may get high margins, but there‚Äôs no reason why the party with singh as leader can‚Äôt win those seats. also singh focuses on inequality issues all the time.",conservatives

the scotland issue, in a nutshell.

however, scotland =/= quebec in so many ways. scotland has 59 seats out of 650, there's actually merit to the argument that they are too small to matter.

quebec on the other hand more often than not plays kingmaker. it happens sometimes, but its incredibly difficult to form government without at least *decent* levels of support in quebec. therefore such an eventuality seems kind of unlikely.

some immigrants from might value their own culture's traditions, but feel that their traditions/norms are not the ones that canada's social conservatives or conservative parties are trying to conserve.

for example, many socially conservative christians in the us wish they could bring back prayer in schools, but a muslim or hindu immigrant would not be very likely to support that, and likely prefer the us education system to be secular (even if they might prefer a religious education system in their old country, where their religion is the majority).

sending samples was the foundation for the espionage claims and the subsequent rcmp investigation. 

if the investigation bore any fruit, then the two would be under police custody or detained, instead of simply being fired and let go free. the fact that they were only fired, and they're allowed to leave freely, already implies more of a goose chase than a potential charge of actual espionage. if not, the rcmp would step in and declare it an ongoing investigation and this article would not be able to publish. 

now the problem becomes one of optics. imo this couple are fired to skirt any negative pr. if they were allowed to continue working, then there would be further outcry. the initial outcry against them is that they were chinese people (with pr cards) and ties with research labs in china, and that would persist and cause more issues with the conservatives. meanwhile, hadju's statement has even made it abundantly clear that there is no causal relationship between their firing and their work, which is aligned with what i've said about them being scapegoats.

you could make a utilitarian argument that the banning of firearms would reduce overall gun violence and therefore be good. you could just as easily make an argument with a more libertarian perspective and argue it restricts freedom unnecessarily, that the way to reduce gun violence is not to restrict gun ownership but rather address the root causes of that violence occurring in the first place. 

a criticism of that second position could be that it is utopian, but that could apply just as equally to that first position, partially due to the ubiquity of guns just in general.

in 2016, then health minister jane philpott asked saskatchewan to end the 2-for-1 mri system that it had set-up, as it effectively flew in the face of the canada health act.

by 2017, the feds gave saskatchewan one-year to prove the system worked. before the end of that, philpott got involved in the whole judy raybould-wilson drama at the time and found herself out of the health portfolio; and, at the time, the issue seemed to slip from the forefront of public consciousness, as by 2018, the deadline came and the federal government was strangely quiet on what they were going to do.

by 2020, after saskatchewan had received crickets on this issue and maintained the status quo, then the federal government announced the plan to roll back transfers to the amount of private tests conducted in jurisdictions that had them.

but, what case has saskatchewan made since they were first warned in 2016? the answer, is not a very good one.

in 2020, the provincial auditor found that the private system was not meeting provincial requirements. despite calls from the government that the 1-for-1 system would reduce wait times and backlog, the waiting list actually doubled between 2015 - 2019.

for moe to now act as though this is a blind-siding attack on saskatchewan is demonstrably false. he, and his government, have been in this fight for awhile and it was painfully clear they were losing it. and given the current track record of the program's 'successes' in saskatchewan, it should serve as a cautionary tale that shows this kind of scheme just doesn't work.

no... this cut is coming 2024. the pandemic will be over. 

2) stating that 3 million and growing people have or will have reading disabilities, strongly implying that this services a large group.

3) no reporting on ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it‚Äôs being cut or any measurement of where the funds go. 

fact: many organizations become completely unaccountable for their money. they play to public sympathy and don‚Äôt provide either benefit, or evidence of benefit of that money spent. the ‚Äújournalist‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even bother to ask. ‚Äúhow many books do you translate/transcribe a year?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat % of money goes to administration versus production‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat measure do you have for equitable distribution rather than just giving books to your friends?‚Äù

if you think there have been a bunch more meetings, you're welcome to provide evidence. but, if they've happened, they've been wildly unproductive.

the absolute first step of pharmacare, under the hoskins report, was to set up the canada drug agency. apparently they agreed to do that in december (they still haven't followed through and done it), 20 months after they promised to work with the provinces on this.

i guess we can agree to disagree on whether c213 would have kickstarted this process. but it's pretty clear the process needs a kickstart, and is currently flailing without much direction or accomplishments to its credit. the ndp's done what it can to fix that. hopefully the liberals step up, and use their much more significant powers as the government, to actually make pharmacare happen.",liberals

gyg16p7,2021-05-16T23:54:26.000-07:00,"338canada: the conservatives' great big climate problem so to start; i agree with you that nuclear energy is underutilized, unfairly demonized, and a vital part of the response to climate change. (though i would say nuclear energy *is* green energy rather than some competing third option.) likewise your concern about the pollution caused in the manufacturing of large batteries is well placed and often overlooked in these conversations.

however climate change is not simply a result of electrical power generation. it is also a result of manufacturing and transportation. (also agricultural policy but that's a separate conversation.) a 100% co2 free power grid would still result in tonnes of greenhouse gasses being pumped into the atmosphere from other sources.

as a right-winger i assume you believe in free market economics (of some variety); that economic actors will behave rationally in their own best interest and that this is the best way to organize economic activity (rather than getting the government to direct things). the theoretical foundations of the carbon tax are based in this understanding. prior to the price on carbon pumping co2 into the atmosphere was free and the negative effects of doing so were not directly felt by whomever it was doing the pumping. in economic terms this is referred to as a negative externality.

a price on carbon internalizes that cost so that the actor that is creating the co2 bears a direct financial cost proportional to the amount of co2 they create. this creates an economic incentive to produce less co2 and therefore firms/individuals, being rational agents acting in their own best economic interest, will seek to reduce their costs. people will drive less, manufactories will find less carbon-intensive methods of production, transportation companies will invest in more fuel efficient vehicles/routes etc. the market will innovate, adapt, and create the solutions needed.

if you are a right-winger and are concerned about climate change then you should be in favour of a carbon tax as it is the most conservative, free market oriented, solution available (even milton friedman recommended a carbon tax as a means of fighting pollution).  all other options require more bureaucracy, more government intervention, and higher public expenditure.",conservatives

don‚Äôt get me wrong, i will never vote for the cpc. even if it were a party of identical rempel clones, aside from finding that to be deeply unnerving, i would find their human rights policy is mostly lip service or otherwise sort of short sighted. 

an example that comes to mind is pushing for lgbt refugees which sounds great until you realize refugee programs already screen for minorities and a better approach is to just give them more funding while shielding them as much as possible from politics. 

but i‚Äôd still greatly prefer it if most cpc mps were like her rather than the more extremist elements of her party. and as much as i disagree often on her analysis, in my books i almost always feel like i can agree on the overall sentiment she promotes when it comes to these sorts of issues.

now watch someone pull out something awful she‚Äôs said that i had no idea about because i don‚Äôt follow her that closely, it‚Äôs just been my casual observation over the years.

we also agree on some other stuff too, fwiw, such as the sort of sexism and misogynistic death threats she‚Äôs called out in the hoc if i remember correctly.",conservatives

it is basically learned by virtue of who your family is/caregivers ... it might as well be innate since nearly all families are a single race, and very few will have more than 2 races. so, the vast vast majority of infants in canada will 'learn' this. (at older ages, exposure can still influence this btw. i read a paper showing that black children raised in very white groups would even subconsciously discriminate against their own race)

my point is that racism would spring from nothing if ignored because it is a natural phenomenon. if we executed every racist and all mentions of race from society, the next generation we would still get new racists. racism is pernicious and it is something that needs to be actively fought. you can't defeat it by passively ignoring the problem.

children need to be taught to go against lots of natural behaviors in order to become healthy adults in modern society .... like, patience. monkeys aren't patient, but it is a skill we need. keeping emotions in check is another important trained skill. sharing. and to go along with those, not judging based on appearances. this is a useful tool even when referring to situations, not just the races of people.

i dislike it when people on the left see there being some endpoint for racism where it is defeated. it'd be like saying we could solve greed.",conservatives

its confusing to be told you have an underbelly that doesn't even have a name, a group similar to al qaeda or the kkk who engage in and organize in these activities, and when the intelligence agencies themselves, the people who historically have looked for any excuse to tar the left, say its not leftist extremism its not going to seem genuine.

&gt;the left's big tent includes these people.

yes, it includes people who will for unrelated reasons engage in violence for motivations unrelated to the left's views and beliefs. i mean... how exactly did his attack manifest anything resembling what you've mentioned? he didn't walk into a wall street bank or behead a ceo, he didn't massacre a cop and his family etc. 

like... how do you connect this shooting to a leftist political motive? how are these victims identifiably connected to his political anger? when someone posts islamophobic shit and then goes and kills muslims its a connection. when someone posts about jews and shoots up a mosque its clearly a connection. when someone is a rabid incel and goes out of their way to murder women at a woman's fraternity that's clearly connected.

but a guy who says he's a leftist and then commits a crime that can't conceivably be connected rhetorically to the politics of his alleged political views how do you draw that connection? how does that \"wash\"? 

have you actually read about the guy?

_on august 10, abc news quoted officials as stating that the gunman had misogynistic views which were much more extreme than his political views.[35]_

_two former high school classmates said betts was suspended from bellbrook high school after he made lists of other students he wanted to kill and rape.[38] the \"hit list\" was discovered in early 2012 and resulted in a police investigation.[38] he was previously bullied and had planned to shoot up the school, a classmate said.[30] over the past year, the gunman had performed live vocals for a pornogrind band called menstrual munchies, a genre which vice news described as a \"misogynistic, male-dominated\" music scene, and buzzfeed described as focused on gore, violence, and necrophilia, and known for its dark, satirical themes of sexual violence delivered for shock value.[39] his high school girlfriend said he complained of visual and auditory hallucinations and psychosis, and was afraid of developing schizophrenia.[40]_

his own history shows that his obsession with violence predates any connection left wing politics and his targets and victims, including his own family members, are not discernibly connected to any politics, but he is more obviously a misogynist than anything else. 

violent left wingers do things like throw molotov cocktails into luxury sports cars and smash up the businesses of big companies they see as exploiters. they generally don't murder people but if they did why would they shoot random people on the street?

nothing about it fits with a political attack. it reads exactly like all those angry misanthropic types who just wanna kill a bunch of people and go out in a blaze of enraged glory.",conservatives
