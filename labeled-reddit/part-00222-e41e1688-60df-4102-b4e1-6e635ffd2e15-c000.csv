it isn’t that canadians are not political, it’s that canadians can’t be political. want to vote for your head of state? you can’t. want to vote for your senator? you can’t. supreme court justices? nope. surely you must be able to vote directly for your choice of pm? hahaha, no. perhaps you can vote down ballot than on prop initiatives? direct democracy? in canada? forget about it.

the way the referendum was framed was in order to tackle a common complaint from people who support pr that choosing a single system as the alternative makes it harder to win support. unfortunately, it looks giving people multiple choices comes with some problems too since now people need to try and understand multiple options. i think the fact that pure party list proportional representation was excluded was a mistake too -- it is by far the simplest system to understand. and i think holding the referendum at the same time as municipal elections was a mistake. it needs it's own vote so that it is the exclusive attention of the media.

the part about 1 party in charge being better for lobbyists goes against the usual logic on these things. the us has a much bigger lobbying issue because they have multiple entry ways into government because each congressman and senator is essentially free to do what they want there (look at what's happening now with their budget bill). it's harder here because usually 1 party controls the government and the party leader usually has almost absolute control. yes, if you can influence that leader, that's great but if you can't, then nothing is within your grasp for 4 to 5 years.",liberals
