the answer is: kinda, not really.

i did a paper for school a few years back and found that there is not national study on this, rather, there are several studies done by police agencies in various cities across the country.  i did find one academic study with the aim of policy advice, but being a few years ago i cannot recall if it was published or still going through the peer-evaluation phase. 

from what i remember, a study conducted by the toronto police found that 80% (or so) of guns used in gun crimes were sourced from the us and around 15% were sourced from various other countries, and the majority of gun-violence was carried out with handguns. there were similar findings in montreal as well. 

intuitively, if most gun-violence is committed in our large cities and most of that crime is committed with handguns, it *should* be painfully obvious **if** licensed owners (or their handguns) are an issue. handguns are classified as restricted, meaning there is a registry of ownership. what i'm getting at is, regardless of the information we as the public can find, the federal government definitely has the ability to deduce what percentage of gun crime is committed with illegally obtained handguns, yet, from what i've seen from the investigations of police agencies is that a large majority of gun crime is carried out with illegal (smuggled) handguns. 

the way i see it, both the may 1st oic and this current plan to allow municipalities to 'ban' handguns is a lazy attempt to appear to make an effort of curbing gun violence in canada, yet it is not substantiated with data in any way. most canadians are completely ignorant on our gun laws and licensing process and have never gone to a range or been taken out for a shoot with a buddy. if the only exposure one has to guns and gun violence is through media (movies, tv shows, or the news) or what the liberal party says, then people typically support it. 

the unfortunate truth is that it is only licensed owners who are affected by these policies. as you may gather from the comments, there are those who own guns and are obviously upset that their hobby that they have put tonnes of time and money into is being taken away from them, while those who are 'anti-gun' couldn't care less about licensed (law abiding) gun owners. its easy political points for the liberals that has not been substantiated with data.",liberals

essentially what this means is that only individual creators who do not monetize their content will be exempt. this becomes problematic because youtube does not push content that is not monetized in suggested content as much as it does monetized content, and also means that an uploader who does monetize their content is at risk at having the channel deleted by youtube as they have reserved the right to delete channels that are not considered \"profitable\" eg: too many non monetized or private/unlisted videos.

he1uj6o,2021-09-23T13:54:15.000-07:00,"after $24 million, is the ndp just done? there are 3 fundamentals that they ndp need to learn and apply:

viral campaigning does not identify your vote and does not bring voters to the polls.  it's a gimmick that frankly doesn't work.  you need recognition in a campaign, and you have to sell the leader, but that isn't a replacement for the ground game. 

the base doesn't respond well to a negative campaign.  the ndp represents a vision of what could be.  being negative just motivates cynicism, which also does not work. 

if voters want center, left of center they vote for the liberals.  voters vote for the ndp because they want a party with big ideas, and the political will to actually do it. 

let's be honest with ourselves.  jack layton got christmas miracle in that he had a very unpopular prime minister with a pissed off and highly motivated electorate.  and a weak liberal opponent and a quebec electorate that wasn't concerned about sovereignty so didn't really care about the bloc.  mulcair fucked up 2015 because he ran against the wrong opponent.  had he aimed is campaign at presenting a better option than the liberals and not moving to center he would be referred to as they right honourable.  instead he wasted time going after the center vote, and allowed the liberals to out flank him on the left. 

how do the ndp do better?  we weaken the bloc by making sure that quebecers feel confident in their sovereignty.  in this we just need to make sure that anything we propose doesn't involve going in there and telling them what we are going to do to them.  practically this means we agree not to challenge the ban on regions symbols.  we agree that they deny pipelines through their territory.  and we do not engage the bloc on any debate about being a distinct society.  sure quebec is a distinct society and we'll engage with them as a nation, next question. 

how do we do better overall.  stop wasting time trying to point out the liberals fualts.  the cpc will do that for.  instead we be positive about what we are offering and how we think things could be.  we also are honest and up front with the math.  specifically the cost and benefits of what we are presenting.  sure your taxes will go to pay for all of this.  but that will be far less than what you're paying now buying whatever service privately.  worried about paying a couple hundred for our education plan?  you're paying tens of thousands of dollars for education now, we are saving you a fuck tonne of money.  same for pharmacare and dental care.  and bring the math with you.  so the next time a reporter tries press the cost you have reciets. 

and most importantly we need to rebuild our networks of volunteers.  and that means we have to really energize the base, and super motivate them.  that means reaching out in-between election cycles.  24 million would be better spent building riding associations, sending jagmeet to communities to build support.  get him into youth groups and community associations.  honestly his time is much better spent in the community than parliament at this point.  town halls and party conventions are the way to go here.",liberals

the cpc gain seems to mostly stem from a collapse of the liberal’s red tory support, rather then a gain from the ndp.

as a dipper i agree and understand the concerns that singh’s messaging is more “woke” then defending labour, but i actually think he did a great job focusing on labour in the french interview this eve. the issue was, he also took a fairly hard an unpopular stance on a top down approach to things like ltc which will not go over well in quebec. the ndp are not going to break the ceiling without quebec unless they can simultaneously grow in the atlantic region and the west - and juggling that is going to be very hard.

the party does seem to be making inroads in western canada, but i agree that neither leader truly lives up to layton’s legacy. i actually think turfing mulclair so quickly was also a huge mistake that cost the ndp dearly in 2019. it hurt then, but 2015 was still one of the best results the ndp has had in decades, paling really only to layton’s 2011 campaign, which had a completely collapsing liberal party involved.",liberals

as a way to show they are more serious and can actually be trusted to follow though, would it be feasible for a party to write the full text of a bill that actually implements the campaign promise they are making and release that as part of their platform? for example, the other day trudeau promised to \"hike taxes on canada's big banks and insurance companies to pay for housing program\". i have zero faith that he will actually do it if he wins, but if that promise came along with a bill with all the details like exactly what the tax rates would be, i'd be much more likely to believe it.

this doesn't seem like super out of the box thinking though. i can't be the first person to have thought of this, so does it actually have a lot of issues i haven't considered? obviously a party wouldn't want to do this in a situation where they are intentionally being vague about a promise because they don't want to follow through, and giving more details would allow people to criticize and flaws in the bill, but it seems like it would be a huge boost to actually getting voters to believe and care about campaign promises.",liberals

generally i think the reaction is a little bit overstated. the liberals absolutely have burned people on a few promises like everybody has, but it’s really, really hard for me to blame them on some things from 2019 given the absolute shitshow they had to deal with with the umsca -&gt; blockades -&gt; straight into covid. keep in mind too it’s only been almost 2 years since the last election so it hasn’t been a full term to enact other promises.

the best thing the liberals can do is point to the policies they promised and delivered on. if we’re going to hold 2015 promises against them they can go all the way back to marijuana, the carbon tax, clean fuel standards, etc etc etc. they did reasonably well in their first term according to even critical trackers. yeah they broke the fptp promise, but i didn’t vote for them in 2015 largely because i knew they inevitably would.

on the other hand, they have begun the implementation - with funds and agreements and everything - of 10$ a day childcare across the nation, generally guided us through the pandemic as well as could be reasonably expected and continue to deliver (albeit more slowly then we’d like) on reconciliation issues - for example all of the shallow graves we are finding are largely a result of funding from the federal government due to the reconciliation attempts beginning in 2015. also while they haven’t fixed all boil water advisories, this is only because more have come online since they began with their promise in 2015 - they have solved more boil water advisories then existed at that time, and all the others are at different stages of either construction or active planning despite covid being a helluva wrench.

in general i think it’s safe to say they will attempt to go after many of these promises. with the liberals you can generally tell which ones are campaign bait (electoral reform) and which aren’t. at least imo.

of course, i’d really like them to go for pharmacare, but maybe we need a weaker liberal minority for that to be strongarmed into existence.",liberals

the requirement is that each country must set a new target every five years, starting in 2020, that the country \"intends to achieve\".  there is also a very strong but not quite mandatory expectation that each one of a country's targets will be more ambitious than its previous target, and that any changes to a target are only to strengthen them.

thus if a country genuinely tries to achieve its target but is unable to do so, that would be a failure on their part but not seen as against the letter or spirit of the agreement per se. but if a country reneges on a previously announced target, that would be seen as a breaking a very strong bit not quite mandatory expextation in the paris agreement.  so it is a bit worse.",conservatives

at the very least someone or some group with high levels of coordination is working on this. it *could* be totally grassroots but there's something a little fishy about it.

the most likely scenario is someone has money or power or prestige and is using that to get some loyal folks to coordinate stuff such that the facebook, brainwashed, anti-everything lemmings become easy prey to corral and turn into tools. 

it's not like this is the equivalent of soros paying off every centre/centre left person in the last us election, but there's definitely a handful of people who are able to spend a lot of their time corralling the facebook lemmings to be disruptive. and those handful of people are either really well off with too much time on their hands, or being supported enough that they can spend all their time tracking where the pm is, how he's getting there, and planning to get a lot of people together in very short order. or if they get no money they're working for a higher cause and supporting someone they trust and look up to - and no random facebook person has quite that level of cachet, so the source is obviously someone who is popular or important even if it's just within the canadian antivaxx realm.

but if you mean that platforms should contain more detail, most parties (unless you're the ontario pcs of course) will offer some details up if you read the fine print. if you're talking about the recent liberal promise on bank taxes, the details [have been posted on the liberal party website](https://liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/2021/08/financial-institutions.pdf). you can tell it's a promise-made-on-the-fly: all it says is the federal portion of the corporate tax rate will increase from 15% to 18% on banks and insurance companies with earnings over $1 billion. the rest of it is \"we'll figure this out in consultation with x, y, and z people\".

however, i would say that promises made \"on the fly\" are not necessarily more likely to be broken. the electoral reform promise was announced months before the 2015 election, repeated by trudeau a whole bunch of times, and contained some details about how it was going to take place (a parliamentary committee with representatives from all parties will be formed, it will consider both ranked ballots and proportional systems, and within 18 months the government would introduce a bill based on the recommendations). it didn't come to pass.

meanwhile, trudeau announced an increase to the basic personal exemption on september 22, 2019, which would cut taxes for everyone by a few hundred bucks. it was a policy that had never been announced before even though they had been in office for 4 years, and it clearly looked like a \"here's some money, now please stop thinking about the past\" promise that was cooked up quickly, to move on from the brownface pictures that showed up a few days before. this tax cut, which might never have been announced if it wasn't for the scandal, actually got implemented.",liberals

and although mr. singh is a compassionate dude, and very likeable, “making the rich pay” can’t make a 10% reduction in our deficit, let alone fund pharmacare. the pbo put a wealth tax at funding roughly 30b at best. let’s say it’s twice as good at 60b. we’re still only 1/8th of the way to digging ourselves out of the hole these louts have dug without any additional spending were that fantasy even remotely realistic.

&gt;ford is worried that a failure, for example, to “close loopholes” that allow air travellers to land in the united states and then cross into canada at a land border, skirting rules for air travellers on hotel quarantines and covid-19 testing, will open his province and the country up to a potential fourth wave.

the feds make the rules of who can come into the country. but enforcement of quarantine is handled by provincial and municipal leos. ford doesn't want people sneaking out of pearson? then send the police to man the exits, find out where people are staying/living, preform checkups, etc. you drop the ball on this, have basically zero contact tracing, then no surprise the variants get to spread.

&gt;“we’re a little disappointed with the federal government after [b.c.] premier [john] horgan and i and others led the charge, frankly, on pushing for a national sick leave program for this pandemic,” manitoba premier brian pallister told reporters in winnipeg a few hours before the first ministers’ meeting. “i’m not giving up on the prime minister yet … i know most premiers would like to see a national program.”

&gt;sources close to horgan said he has been frustrated that ottawa appears to be pressuring provinces to quickly design, implement and pay for a sick leave program that he and other premiers believe could and should be done best by the federal government.

again, why is global just letting the provinces abdicate their responsibility on this. frustration that ottawa has been pressuring you to do this quickly? you've had over a year to sort this out! the federal government can't legislate paid sick leave. they were all fine with the fed's benefit when they introduced it, didn't hear any push back then, but now horgan and pallister have been leading the charge!",liberals

the map of canada (many maps exist online and can be found via google, a popular website) will show you that ontario and quebec are not in the centre of the country. the cambridge dictionary defines \"centre\" as \"the middle point\" of an object. the object in this case is canada (see map). it is roughly 5000km from the atlantic ocean to the pacific. those are the two oceans that border our country. fun fact: there is a 3rd ocean to the north! it would stand to reason, then, that the centre of the country would not be in ontario or quebec, as the middle of a 5000km-long line would be at the 2500km point. 

at this point, you could argue that centre has an alternate meaning, as in: the focal point of a group. colloquially, one could say \"/u/pengoyo is clearly the centre of the party\". i would suggest that the centre then becomes subjective and not so clearly defined.

i would suggest that more canadians look at a map, instead of insisting that ontario is the centre of the universe.

h48dgje,2021-07-05T22:53:27.000-07:00,"abacus poll - lpc 37%, cpc 25%, ndp 20%, bq 7%, grn 6% i agree with your second point, at some point voters will sour on trudeau and the lpc and another party will put forth a more appealing proposition. it's exactly how trudeau came to power in 2015 against harper, and, unless he steps down himself for a popular replacement, is likely to be how his term ends someday.

issue is with seeing polling as a driver of outcomes, polling is typically instead an indicator of how other inputs have impacted potential outcomes. pollsters are testing who canadians think would be the best fit for the country at a given moment, an assessment that's based on how they perceive the parties' relative strengths, weaknesses, and potentials. polling can certainly influence outcomes, but it is rarely a major driver. 

in the cpc's case, i'd see this as more a reflection of their poor performance during the pandemic (especially their provincial counterparts in ab), an uninspiring-at-best leader, and a lack of an appealing vision for what they would actually do in power. the strategy i mentioned was one proposed in a few outlets as a means to rebuild a cross-canada coalition by doing exactly what you mentioned, trading votes out west for more elsewhere.",liberals

if you have never read it, or maybe haven't read it since 2011, go read [layton's last letter to canadians](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jack-layton-s-last-letter-to-canadians-1.991992).

i remember when i first read this. i was in the middle of a lot of changes in my life. back then, it helped me get through the remaining years under harper (didn't end up being as bad as we thought thankfully) and inspired who to choose for a new liberal leader, and eventually support justin trudeau. (i voted for deborah coyne in 2013 lol) it seemed like we were on the cusp of a great change, especially after the 2015 election when we were out on the streets talking to people.

it is good reading during the darkest times, whether it is the seemingly 'dark time' of a conservative majority or the actual dark time of a global pandemic killing hundreds of thousands. today, i can't help but agree with layton's pitch for a better country, built by hopeful people:

&gt;canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. we can be a better one – a country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. we can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly.

&gt;  
&gt;men over the age of 55, meanwhile, were most likely to object to the statement “canadian is a racist country.” a mere 21 per cent of males born before the year 1966 backed the notion.

&gt;  
&gt;across the board, it was quebecers who were most likely to bristle at the notion of canada as a haven for racism. only 24 per cent of respondents from la belle province ascribed racism to canada. only 18 per cent of the quebec nationalist bloc quebecois, meanwhile, backed the “racist” canada notion — the lowest of any single canadian political party.

&gt;  
&gt;the poll also revealed a hardcore minority of canadians who expressed openly racist beliefs to pollsters. roughly 12 per cent of canadians endorsed the notion that “some races are naturally superior to others.” that belief was strongest among canadians of visible minorities, 18 per cent of whom endorsed the sentiment.",conservatives

it's actually quite impressive we are only now beginning to see serious levels of inflation in spite of all this. but yeah, i don't envy the position the bank of canada finds itself in now. i don't see how raising rates slowly over the course of a year will do much to reign in inflation expectations, especially since most of the inflation can be explained by a devastated supply chain.

well, it's actually quite a bit different as i mentioned earlier the us had white flight, red lining, mortgage bans in their suburbs, where of course the single dwelling homes are, versus the urban cores.    

&gt;they still have most of the wealth. they are 27% of the pop but own 50% of the wealth in canada. they also had 50 years of influence on the political landscape including shifting the structure of municipalities to allow the say to veto development.   

ah, so you think that 27% of the population owning 50% of the real estate wealth (which is what your npr podcast actually talked about) is somehow profound?  wonder how that could possibly be?  i mean who's more likely to own a multi million dollar property, a boomer, or a millenial?  never heard of the concept of a starter home?  things for the most part easily explained.   the other obvious plot twist is that boomers haven't controlled the real estate scene since they bought their first home.  50 years ago, they were the millenial home owners of the day.  the market would have been dominated by not even the silent generation but the greatest generation, who were in their prime earning years and when suburbs really started to take off.  this would have been way more apparent in the us as the gi bill, and white flight really kicked in (remember i said there were differences, well this is one huge difference).     

&gt;is that fact some of them are immigrants change anything?    

it's to underscore the fact that japan's population is shrinking.

yeah, when was the last time tokyo experienced a one percent growth rate?  1990.  it's grown by 0.19% or less since 2012.  not exactly a tough problem to deal with.  what has the growth rate in cma's in canada?  toronto and montreal cma's have only seen a population shrink starting in 2019/2020.

&gt;as i said, they shifted to building up because a consultation process didn't exist when they had to.   

ahh, you think it's all about consultation?  well let's take a look at when new york was [built.](https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/building-age-and-rents-in-new-york)   rather illuminating that the vast majority of the buildings are over or rapidly approaching 100 years old.  do you honestly think there was any consideration for who was going to build what then?   like i said, if they pivoted, it was 100 years ago, but i doubt they pivoted ever, it was more of an organic evolution, as more people came, houses became scarcer, as space was extremely limited, as was transportation, so literally if you wanted more people to work in nyc, more people had to live in nyc.  that's not the case any longer now is it?  hasn't been for a long time, that's what suburbs solved, that's what technology has solved, certainly for you, correct?    

&gt;i made choices to work from home. i don't commute. i opted for living much further away from the metro core in exchange for affordability and large sqft.    

everybody makes those choices.  that's why i live in a small city, 19k people, but it's growing, not anywhere near as fast as surrounding communities, but that's been because of municipal planning.  

it's not that i disagree with your 2/3 scenario, but the reality of the situation is you don't want it, i don't want it, who do you think wants it?  so if nobody actually wants it, how do you think it will happen?  it's an articulate solution that nobody wants, in other words it's not an actual plan.  a real plan deals with why is home single detached home ownership okay for us, but not okay for someone else, to want?  and why do we get to protect our investment and lay all the blame on boomers?  that's the part you have yet to explain.  i mean i would make a case that the younger the home owner, or more appropriately the new the first time home buyer, the greater the interest in keeping the status quo.  if my house price dropped in half tomorrow, it would still be double what we paid for it 8 years ago.  doubt the same could be said for most home owners 8 years in, especially in downtown metro homes.  if they get a 50% market correction they likely owe way more on the house, than it's worth, which is problematic to say the least.   

what's the answer?  i don't really know, because there are lots of factors involved, but the one thing i do know, this isn't a mess created by boomers, exclusively.  it misses the point, ignores voting apathy of those affected the most, and requires that people die younger, both for inheritance sake and to open up the market.  can you guess why i think it's the lazy and wrong answer?",liberals

as for capital gains tax increases not being good, i will happily get into it. a competitive capital gains tax was designed originally to help encourage people, institutions, and organizations to make investments in the economy, in hopes of garnering a return. these investments help generate tax revenue for the state (province, state, federal government etc.), create jobs (people involved in making whatever investment happen, which pays even more tax, increases consumer spending etc. makes the world go round), it may provide services long-term if it was a public sector investment as well and the list goes on. to specify, i can use more clearer examples to help you understand what i am saying. first example, the government decides to spend billions on infrastructure to build more go lines in the gta. they hire private construction companies who employ a lot of people who help build these go lines. the government collects tax back from the company who made money and as well as the workers who work for the company. on top of all of that, they are left with a service that the public can use - at a cost - which provides revenue for the government to help employ more people to maintain it, run it (etc. etc. etc.). this is one example of an investment, but it is a public investment so capital gains may not be applicable but you see the layers of the process. maybe a better example is building a home, a company hires people, where people work for them, and then they sell it (using a real estate agent who pays tax) and in the end the developer makes a capital gains profit. if the capital gains tax is increased, maybe a lot of these opportunities are no longer opportunities because their venture is no longer profitable. and that is why we need capital gains to remain competitive. this also applies to the stock market, but it is more blurry because of things like the tfsa and rrsp that are designed to help canadians lower their tax burden and grow their investments.

here is a piece from the us senate joint economic committee studying the impacts of capital gains taxation throughout us history. on page 2, in the executive summary they say: \"the historical evidence suggest that capital gains tax reductions tend to increase
tax revenue. when capital gains tax rates were lowered in 1978 and again in 1981, revenue climbed steadily. conversely, when the tax rate was increased in 1987, revenue began declining despite
forecasters predictions it would increase. for instance, capital gains tax revenue in 1985 equaled $36.4billion after adjusting for inflation, yet $36.2 billion was collected in 1994 under a higher tax rate. in
other words, tax revenue in 1994 was slightly less than it was in 1985 even though the economy was larger, the tax rate was higher, and the stock market was stronger in 1994.\" below is the study, you can read all of it if you want, it is pretty insightful. 

https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b3116098-c577-4e64-8b3f-b95263d38c0e/the-economic-effects-of-capital-gains-taxation-june-1997.pdf 

to conclude, investments make the world go round, literally. we want companies, and the public - me and you - to make investments to help drive the economy. capital gains tax increases may reduce the number of opportunities because of profitability - it will reduce the number of profitable opportunities to make investments. when we want to encourage people to invest their money, not sit on it, we incentivize it through the capital gains tax. that is where its power lies.

- nevertheless no human has the moral authority to make the judgement call about who is the weak.
- plague is a natural eugenic force though, and thus should be used as a controlled burn to remove the unworthy without the moral hazard. 
- deviating from this is unnatural; refusing the vaccine shows our confidence in our natural superiority
- cheating this natural order will no doubt create a karmic rebound on those who do accept the vaccine. demanding the strong submit to this to protect the weak is tyranny
