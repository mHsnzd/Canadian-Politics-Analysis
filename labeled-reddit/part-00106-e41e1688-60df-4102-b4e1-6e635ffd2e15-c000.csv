&gt;in 2016, he apologized for canada turning back the komagata maru, a ship carrying mostly sikhs that was then forced to return to india, where 20 of them were killed in a riot. the next year, he apologized to survivors of residential schools in newfoundland and labrador, and to lgbt canadians for discrimination they faced at the hands of the federal government. the next year, jews and members of the tsilhqot’in nation received apologies for historical wrongs inflicted on them. and so on. it was a thing.

&gt;a man who so clearly adores taking a stage to shed a few tears while acknowledging wrongs committed by someone else, long ago, probably can’t avoid wondering who, in a hundred years, will be apologizing to uyghurs for his refusal to clearly state that what is happening to them is a genocide.

&gt;the pm who proudly declared that canada was back was given a chance to put his vote on the right side of history. he didn't show up. and a century from now, someone will probably feel moved to apologize for that. indeed, it might not take that long.

trudeau understands these things and is perfectly willing to apologize for others (apologies that should have been given and i support that), but never for himself. when given a chance to do the right thing now he didn't do it and as a result a future government will be apologizing for him.",liberals

work with me here

for 40 mil over 2 years so let's say 20 mil a year.
first they need a location so we'll say that costs about 1mil-1.5 mil to build from new and that needs to be furnished so we'll throw another 80 grand at that. then i assume witha community of 850 people that at worst there are 100 children max who would need to be in protective care, so let's work with that number. so just to supervise let's say we'd need about 10-15 people there and it would need to be staffed 24/7 basically. so that would probably mean that all in all about 20-25 total employees on a salary  of let's say 50000 (idk how much they would actually make but roll with me) lets say it costs about 4800 a year to feed and clothe each kid and lets but aside 100000 a year for administrative fees or whatever. 

so assuming this was a huge facility taking in a hundred kids with 22 staff at opening, thats this place costs 1.5 million to run per year plus 1.5 million to build a site. plus 100k for admin and let's just again add 200000k a year in running costs for fun. 
so 1.8 mil a year for a massive facility and they're giving them 40 mil... so plus the facility they got 18 years of running it.

where an industry has more people available globally to do the work than work needing to be done, and where the standard of the work and the requirements are not in any way localised, i can see an argument against it. but those high value specialist roles you're talking about are generally not in that place and pretty much every complex sector is desperate to find staff right now, so i can't see any way that the majority of businesses could relocate such roles to avoid something most of the staff members would consider to be a benefit. i think the argument you're making is similar to the one used historically against corporation tax and minimum wage increases - the majority of businesses would be much more negatively impacted by the costs of relocation and/or staff replacement than by absorbing the attendant costs of the legislative change.

not to mention i think that for many staff and organisations the consideration would be moot, as much like working hours legislation salaried staff will have the option to decide whether to enforce it. many people in high value complex roles genuinely love what they do and will be happy to continue working five days a week, others will treat it fairly flexibly (let's be honest, friday afternoons are for many people the start of the weekend anyway), and some will take the four day week as standard knowing that their value to the organisation is such that the company will simply work around it.",liberals

if this happens, and theft to fund addiction continues, then crime will still be down by a lot, because there will be no more crime in using the drugs, and there will be no more crime in selling the drugs.

but aside from that, crime to fund drug habits may in fact be reduced because

* black markets artificially inflate prices, government heroin could be a lot cheaper and less theft would be necessary to fund a habit
* black markets provide irregular supply, so you're more likely to go a long time without a fix and resort to a desperate tactic to get one
* reducing stigma/penalty for drug use lessens that chance that it will cost you your job and family, which leads to antisocial behaviour, hence legalizing won't instantly heal every antisocial addict, but will decrease the pressures that cause function addicts to become antisocial

i feel as though conservatives believe the cbc has a left leaning bias because they are used to getting their information from conservative social media echo chambers. so when they hear cbc radio for example, the reality of non-biased reporting for say, world or domestic news, can seem to be told through a left leaning lens. in reality, as someone who listens to cbc radio regularly, their broadcast is pretty cut and dry. opinions are said sparingly and when they are shared, they tend to show both sides of the issue.

part of the concept in many countries is that it is important that the state, as embodied through its employees with coercive powers, be devoid of religion in action and appearance. that's how you get places like turkey where one cannot wear religious veils in public positions, although that has been waning since erdogan. or tunisia and algeria pre arab spring. or france, belgium and switzerland.  

that said, it's dubious if not unlikely that this law stems from a desire to protect religious minorities from the majority like those of france, tunisia, turkey, etc

i'm personally for laïcité to some extent, although i'd have started by cleaning up the crumbs of catholism left all over our public institutions and i think it was idiotic to include teachers despite them not being part of the liberals' bouchard taylor commission's recommendations. i mean, for lots of hospitals that were forcibly secularized, they had the nuns and priests change their clothes but left crucifixes hanging all over the place -_-",liberals

alberta is very much dominated by the cpc. ideologically motivated cpc voters (as opposed to say fiscal conservatives) are notorious for their antipathy towards islam and muslim majority ethnicities, particularly when they're from the middle east.

that was what i was getting at.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;however. alberta is fucking atrocious when it comes to casual racism leveled against first nations people. people who would chide someone for making a joke about jews or sikhs are absolutely okay with saying the craziest stuff about \"the fucking indians\".

the problem with this is that at this point saying anything that's not glowingly positive of first nations people is deemed racist or systemically racist, at least by some.

many fn reservations have a number of unique social problems that're unaddressed because people are too reluctant to talk about them. would bringing those issues up be anti-fn bigotry to your mind? like we know that all those missing and murdered indigenous women are overwhelmingly murdered by people in their own communities, so why are we pretending that the rcmp is killing them? or blaming it on colonialism when canada is a post-colonial country?

anti-flipping tax will introduce further obstacles into the real estate market and only make things more expensive - same as land transfer tax. every cost gets priced in the sale price, and buyers end up paying for it.

blind bidding is the only positive change, everything else will do absoutely nothing.

the only way to reduce prices is to build more - and not a little more, but open the floodgates more. if canadian public wants to store money in real estate, instead of putting obstacles up, let builders build like in spain, and if market over-supplies, price tanks and whole ghost towns will exist - who cares.

and to open the floodgates, people need land. that means drop restrictions on farmland development and various greenbelts. this is canada, land is one thing that there is a fuckton of. noone cares if pumpkins grow slightly better around vancouver, housing is more important and more profitable and generates more jobs then agriculture; grow them pumpkins elsewhere or buy them from mexico, agriculture is dirt cheap.

the only reason there is scarcity, is because of artificial blocks on development - it takes a century to build a highway, it takes 2 centuries to build a powerplant (and they have to move it twice while mid-construction, because reasons), and it takes 300 archeological excavations of a pit some hunters used for shitting 1000 years ago to begin a subdevelopment. enough with this garbage. 

if a farmer wants to sell his land to the developer - let him, zero questions asked.  if developer wants to start building homes on the land - let him, zero questions asked. if power and roads are needed - build them with no questions asked and bulldoze whatever is in the way with zero fucks given. if some fish and birds are displaced - build them a nice pond 100km away somewhere instead of running environmental asessments for 20 years (i worked as a student for pickering airport in ontario - they are still running environmental assessments, 30 years later. its a fucking airport, not a terraforming project affecting half the damn continent). and the greenbelts? work around them, put highways across them, and keep on building.",liberals

my bad. however, the oringinal poster was questioning the safety of the vaccine. bad faith misinformation like that is what is causing  people to forgo the vaccines.

&gt;studies were not complete ... i’m saying that that is likely a core reason why we see low vaccination rates 

it's not rational to forgo vaccines just because we don;t know how long the resistance will last. the rational thing to do based in this fact is to get the vaccine and expect a booster later on.  if people are detered from taking the vaccine it's because arguments like yours  make them believe incorrectly that the vaccines are uinsafe. 

\\&gt; im pointing out how the “this is all normal, nothing to see here” messaging on covid-19 vaccine development is false. the moment everyone starts screaming that the vaccine was developed under totally standard parameters, a certain number of people are going to be suspicious.

it was developed under standard parameters for a pandemic vaccine.  thpse have been in place since the sars outbreak almost 20 years ago. implying that they pose some sort of risk is wrong. 

\\&gt; guess what! medical treatment is a matter of personal choice and conscience

absolutely. no one shoudlbe held down and forcibly poked with the virus. it;'s always a choice. 

and that choice comes with an enormous risk and responsibility, both to youself and to others.  if an ubnvaccinated person does not t assume the responsibility to social distance,wear masks,  and avoid crowds, they can violate the right to bodily integrity of several people and give them the virus. this will increase the risk of uinvacinated people again overwhelming the medical system, and denynig the right of other people to timely medical service as health system resources are shifted to taking care of covid victims. 

 all vaccine passports and mandates do is assure that unvaccinated assume the responsiblities to take extra social distancing measures  that a responsible person of concience woudl recongize as coming  with the decision to forgo the vaccine. 

the fact is, if unvaccinated people don;t social distance, they are putting themselves, other people, and the entire halth system at risk. that remains a fact whether they choose to deny it or not.",liberals

&gt;generally, inflation is for the bank of canada to handle at arm’s length from the government, through interest rates. but o’toole’s team has repeatedly shown little faith in the bank of canada to keep inflation under control and accuses the central banker of being a pawn to liberal shenanigans.

o'toole isn't wrong. the bank has only so many levers in front of them, they have been going nuts making cheap credit available to those who already have assets. this has predictable results, assets become more expensive, but the ability of the central bank to actually stimulate the economy is lacking. so an aggressive fiscal stimulus with the bank of canada pulling back on its free money for the banks is likely to balance the economy somewhat. wages will increase, we will still have inflation, but it won't be in the same markets and areas as we get if it is purely a monetary stimulus. the counter proposal from the author:

&gt;but the main answer for how a government can help people make ends meet without simply handing out money to them is probably the unsexiest policy ever, and the least conducive to shouting from the hustings: increasing productivity — making more with less.

&gt;that’s a word any experienced political operative will studiously avoid, partly because it’s fraught with implications that people will have to work harder and longer for the same amount of money.

is merely her own attempt to shit on workers and the younger generation. it's not that the younger generation is working insufficiently hard, its that the scales are tipped against them. whats more, simply increasing productivity, as any economist will tell you is something that every economist would love, but if we largely already do it as much as we can.",conservatives

sorry to be clear, new entrants charge market price for the first tenant who is then protected by rent control (in quebec, only after five years). i disagree that this has a significant effect on new construction. new buildings are overwhelmingly concerned with the initial rent, and generally project increases in line with inflation thereafter. a project's financials simply aren't materially changed by the slightly limited upside imposed by rent controls. thus its not surprising that we see no such effect in reality. of canada's three major cities, montreal had the strictest control, vancouver a moderate control and toronto no control. yet montreal boasts the strongest rental construction, vancouver second place and toronto the worst.

the negative effect of rent controls is in the allocation efficiency. because tenants may pay very different rates for similar apartments, the distribution of the rental housing stock is sub-optimal. but this *increases* market rents, the most important thing for rental housing developers.

&gt;ultimately, rent controls are an attempt to transfer value from landlords to incumbent renters

i have to object to the way you've phrased this. rent controls have exemptions for actual improvements to the property, so in the vast majority of cases increases above inflation are unearned (economic) rent by the landlord. preventing landlords from extracting these rents is not taking value that was created by landlords.

&gt; if that transfer is effective, then it by definition reduces returns on housing and therefore the incentive for capital investment;

again, i'm lost. we've already established that the rent control affects incumbent landlords rather than new ones. the supply produced by incumbents already exists.

let me put this another way. we could introduce a land value tax, which would transfer a huge amount of wealth from incumbent landlords to the public. but you this wouldn't affect construction at all. i hope this demonstrates that it is, in principle, possible to take value from incumbent landlords without reducing the supply. these two things are simply not inherently connected the way you imply.",liberals

this is in fact literally what they should be trying to do in order to expand their tent and win government. 

o'toole's issue is not that he tried to be moderate, it's that he tried to be moderate after running his leadership campaign and acting in a different way previously. it was inconsistent and gave other parties something to point to and frame him as untrustworthy. \"he said x a year ago and now he says y so what will he actually do\", essentially. he needed to commit from day one to sell it.

also they need a better platform. why did they spend half the campaign touting their $60b for healthcare when the costing then showed it to be $3.6b for the first five years and the rest later? it just looks deceptive and probably disappointed people who were interested in that promise at the start.",conservatives

for norm di pasquale (who, to my knowledge, is not an alleged rapist) to beat the still-official liberal candidate, he would need to get at least 22% of the vote in total, which would mean picking up 14% in addition to his banked 8.1%. if 69% of the vote is outstanding, then that means getting ~21% of the e day vote. mathematically it is pretty certain that he beats the alleged rapist, under these assumptions.

in fact, if we presuppose the lpc candidate gets 10% of the election day vote, it is mathematically almost impossible for them to win, unless we assume an almost-perfect 5-way vote split, which is unlikely.

higgs shed around 20 points in his approval ratings right after calling the election, and the nb pcs lead shrank as the campaign went on and people remembered that outside of the covid handling, there wasn't much to like about this government. they basically got their razor-thin majority because of advance votes.

the fact is our current government bears a huge responsibility for the fact the afghan interpreters are in their current situation. its been obvious for years the taliban were gaining ground, there were yearly offensives where they grabbed more and more districts. yet when it came to bringing the interpreters who helped our military to canada, there was a lack of political will to expedite things. we saw with the syrian refugees how quickly the goverment could move when it wanted to.

the cynic in me finds it difficult not to believe the reason the afghan interpreter situation wasn't resolved years ago was because treudeau had no photo op opportunity at the airport like he got with the syrian refugees.

the real issue with the carbon reward points program is the complexity of it, and complexity means \"lots of details need to be worked out\", which in turn means \"vulnerable to lobbyist pressure\". even if o'toole sincerely wants the program to work, the likely result here is that the list of qualifying items will depend on whoever is best able to access the corridors of power and persuade his ministers to add to the list. 

and how are we going to handle the privacy issues? o'toole has been resistant to vaccination mandates, at least rhetorically, because some people on the right fear how much information the government is tracking about them ... now imagine if there was a permanent program that would track what you're spending things on, which either the cra or some interac-like consortium has access to.

this is a political document attempting to square the circle that o'toole knows carbon pricing is close to essential to make substantial ghg cuts, with his party's past vehement opposition to carbon taxes.

&gt; it's been said that through chequing account banking fees canadians are being taken to the cleaners annually. in fact, it's more like to the tune of about $185 per year but that's still $185 that could be put to better use arguably.

&gt; so suggests a 2010 study by vision critical commissioned by ing direct canada that finds more than half of canadians (55 per cent) have a fee-based chequing account and on average, they dole out $185 per year in fees for these accounts.

&gt; \"that average includes people that are paying monthly fees and most banks charge monthly fees in the range of $10-$15 per month. in some cases, these accounts are subject to additional fees on top of that,\" explains john davis, head of product management and market research at ing direct canada in toronto. \"you might find other charges such as buying cheques for your account or viewing cheques online, a lot of banks charge for that. these types of things add up.\"

&gt; “now they are back at it, gouging their way to record profits in 2021 and the government should step in and stop the excessive gouging that is clear with so many bank service fees and interest rates,” said conacher.

&gt; conacher said canadians are paying some of the highest fees in the world as well as credit card interest rates. he said banks should be audited to see if they have areas where their profits are excessive so they can be reduced.

&gt; “it's just a clear sign that it's an uncompetitive market that needs to be regulated,\" said conacher.

at least 90% of the transgender stuff in society today is just kids being rebellious.  kids need to rebel, it's a normal part of human nature, and it's not rebellious to do what your parents or grandparents did.  when i was a kid, having long pretty hair and a pierced ear was badass (and really pissed my dad off), and having one tattoo was totally hardcore.  when my pop was growing up, it was sporting slicked hair (instead of the buzzcut) and leaving the top shirt button undone.  when you're a kid and trying to be rebellious, you can't rebel the same way as those old people did, because that's just lame.

what else to today's kids have that holds shock value?  they can't get tattoos and piercings, because mom &amp; dad both have ink sleeves and pierced nipples.  they can't do strange hair, because grandpa still wears a metal mullet and grandma has a purple mohawk.  the only thing left is this gender-identity nonsense, because that has shock value.  instead of saying \"you can't tell me what i can't wear to school\", the kids are saying \"you can't tell me what gender i am\".  

like my generation and others before and after it, these kids will look back and laugh about their transitional years sooner than they think.  and who knows what their kids will come up with when they reach the inevitable rebellion stage.  identify as another species?  claim to be able to time travel?  maybe poodle skirts and letter-sweaters will make a comeback for all i know.",conservatives

the crux of the issue will remain getting people to planes to be evacuated. as noted in the article, all countries running evacuations are dealing with the same difficulty in getting people to their aircraft, likely a function of extremely strict scheduling to keep planes moving orderly.

&gt;“the information that i’m hearing from other lawyers and from people who are contacting me from afghanistan is that getting to the airport is not really the issue,” said immigration lawyer chantal desloges.

i appreciate the concern in communication to individuals that they can leave afghanistan, but **the big fucking lie from just days ago about the pmo stopping evacuations** has left little to no credibility to \"some people are saying\" style reports out of the country.

everyone is having the same problems, so it's more than likely not a function of the immigration/refugee system, unless everybody's system is the same, which we know it isn't.

it's complicated and hard to get people out of the country. all international governments are facing the same struggles. it's going to go on for a while until their is either stabilization of the country and people are free to move and leave, or the taliban backs out of their word and cracks down on everyone, overrunning the airport.",liberals

&gt;however, conservatives challenged her ruling, arguing that the decision to begin preparing the committee report didn’t preclude hearing from more witnesses.

&gt;all opposition members, including the bloc’s andreanne larouche, voted to overturn mccrimmon’s ruling.

in order for us to know that it was impractical, they'd have to have tried aggressive enforcement of the at-home quarantine and failed, but they never tried to begin with, so we can't know that.

&gt; the spread may have already happened when they take public transport from the airport

this describes the current state of transportation from the airport to the quarantine hotels; everyone's packed into the complimentary airport shuttle like it's two years ago.  i'm pretty sure people returning to canada before the quarantine hotels were set up were explicitly instructed not to take public transit; i haven't seen any evidence that this demand was routinely flouted.

&gt; or go out before the end of the 14-day window

i haven't seen any evidence that this demand was routinely flouted, either, and trudeau even said people were almost all complying with it.

not a great argument, but \"special measures\" are still subject to the charter.
