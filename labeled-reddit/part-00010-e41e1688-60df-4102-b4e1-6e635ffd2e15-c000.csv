waiting until clients are travelling to work again to undertake projects would impact more people commuting which would also have impacts on the economy. people spending more money on alternative forms of transit and / or people being less productive because they're forced to spend more time taking an alternate route

&gt;this analysis covers five pre-recession periods under five prime ministers. figure 1 shows the change in quarterly (annualized rates) gross domestic product (gdp), adjusted for inflation, from 1985 to 2020. the recessions of 1990/91, 2008/09, 2015, and 2020 are fairly easy to see in the data. and, while not technically a recession, the last quarter of 2000 through the entirety of 2001 was a period of comparatively weak gdp growth, often referred to as the “2001 slowdown”. indeed, the average quarterly
rate of annualized growth over this period was just 0.3% and the economy actually contracted in the third quarter of 2001.

for those who wonder why, consider this. conservatives namesake is to keep things as they once were. green party by default actually is a partner in politics in this regards; just over different ideals. gp looks to conserve the planet. conservatives look to conserve society.

most of their differences and animosity towards each other mostly stems from their differing opinions on these matters, but the end goals are mostly the same. to conserve.

if they can work out a way to collectively work together, they could do some pretty interesting things in our political playground. but!

they are going to have to get over the differences, most of which stem from the lack of proper understanding of how certain things work; like nuclear energy with the green party being complete nimbys about it.

and for those who really don't agree with their similarities existing; remember that anti-vaxx which is now blamed on conservatives; started with green party members.

here is just one example, but you will be able to find more. [https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/elizabeth-mays-so-called-party-of-science-seems-to-support-a-lot-of-unscientific-public-policies](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/elizabeth-mays-so-called-party-of-science-seems-to-support-a-lot-of-unscientific-public-policies)

of course you'll come across all the stuff about jill stein for example right now. sources like snopes says its false; but snopes has been found to source its own tail, like wikipedia has before as well.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/12/22/the-daily-mail-snopes-story-and-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers/?sh=95f5270227f8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/12/22/the-daily-mail-snopes-story-and-fact-checking-the-fact-checkers/?sh=95f5270227f8)

so i don't give it any credibility without a pile of salt anymore. just like wikipedia and all other internet sources. i wouldn't be surprised if people are trying to cover up the bad press from the past couple decades of green party insanity.

\\*note, i am not saying all green party members are crazy, nor anti-vaxxers. i merely remember quite well the constant arguments with such members, and removing myself from the green party over it all. so, you can hopefully easily imagine my reticence in believing sources like snopes right now. especially when 2016 was one of the worst years of it all.

this huffpo link might actually be more factual than some of the others i have found that just say \"yes she is an anti-vaxxer\" and \"no she isn't\". they at least play both sides on the matter.

\\*final note. if you want real evidence of how loopy some of the green supporters can be, just go talk to some of them. you'll find they agree with conservatives on more than they realize, but never will admit to it; since they are so far apart in the political spectrum when you consider politics to only be a straight line.

so without the ability to permanently support these people such that they don't have to worry, we should be doing our best to focus on the \"be kind to each other\" \"throw no stones\" \"accept differences\" basic things instead. and i say this as a not very practicing catholic so maybe i'm wrong but i'd like to think that i learned from religion as a child to idk, follow the golden rule and think about how my actions impact others and try to help as much as i can and be open minded. i guess i stopped being super religious right at that point where they teach you rulesets that hem you in and make you bigoted.",conservatives

for something like a high end negative income tax for instance, somebody earning $15,000 cad would pay no federal income tax and receive $21,500 in benefits (with monthly cheques of $1,791.67 cad) for people with no income, the nit benefit would be $29,000 cad and be more for retirees than the current cpp maximum.  for something, less comprehensive like a regular ubi, that's a maximum of $10,00-15,000 cad for someone with no income.",liberals

in conjunction with reasonable carbon pricing, it would be a good idea - requiring heavy emitters to set aside some money that can only be spent on environmentally friendly purchases is a clever way to encourage a green transition. it's a bizarre scope creep for the federal government (the flair applies), but at least as a policy scheme it doesn't suck. it's just not a replacement for carbon pricing. at all.

the purpose of a pigouvian tax is to make it more expensive to pollute, and to thereby encourage people to pollute less. the ceiling price is already insultingly low ($50/tn), but the actual \"tax effect\" is much lower than even that, because *you get the money back with strings attached*.

(self reposting an example)

&gt; suppose your average canadian emits 16 tonnes per year at the future peak of $50/tn. they have to set aside $800 in the savings account, but $300 of that they were going to spend on bus tickets anyway. the remaining $500 they use to buy a bike that they only value at $400. the whole tax costs them $100, or $6/tn. the marginal cost is $10/tn (assuming for simplicity that they might buy 0.9 or 1.1 bikes).

$10/tn might as well not be a tax at all. this doesn't even reach the question of secondary markets. if you drive a pickup truck and really like it, what's to stop you from taking your savings account, spending it on bus tickets, and selling them at a tiny discount?",conservatives

in 2018, alberta was going through the pipeline crisis, where albertan oil prices dropped to all time lows (hitting a low of about $6/barrel before notley was forced to take the unprecedented step of capping oil production in a free market economy). yet, [in that same year, the province was one of only three net payers into confederation (bc and ontario being the other two), with alberta having by far the largest net contribution per capita at $3,995 per person](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/publicwebsite/default/en_ca/researchpublications/201701e#show/hide) (bc was second at $2,042 per person). **in a time of economic crisis in alberta, they were still the province with the highest federal government revenue per capita and the lowest federal government expenditures per capita.**

also, just a bit of perspective there, the pipeline crisis in 2018 was caused by trudeau cancelling the northern gateway pipeline in 2015. oil sands production levels are set 5-10 years in advance, so anyone with a calculator who cared to know knew that pipelines would exceed capacity by 2018 if a new pipeline weren't opened (and there is no doubt that trudeau was told this by dozens of oil lobbyists and advisors).

in my opinion, o'toole has no serious plan to implement anything of worth or substance, and knows his party won't back him on it anyway, so he is resorting to the tried and true method of just repeating nonsense and hoping the media stops asking him about it. which i can almost guarantee they will. so it is a fantastic political strategy in that sense although terrible for canadian efforts to mitigate climate change.",conservatives

you can't play chicken with physics - more carbon means more climate change.  the atmosphere doesn't care about geopolitics.  so if you say that china isn't doing its part, my position is that this is all the more reason for us to cut drastically.

there's also little reason why greening our economy has to kneecap it, particularly for a mature economy like canada which doesn't rely on explosive growth for stability.  it's about gradually shifting economic activity to less carbon-intensive sectors, something a carbon tax is exquisitely suited for.",conservatives

*the ndp is the most viable party furthest to the left in canada.*

it's kind of funny that you accuse the conservatives of \"black and white thinking\" while not addressing the point raised and by raising a red herring.

first, conservatives know that china has money.   that's why they're a bigger problem than a poor country with a horrible government.   your  objection is like responding to a comment about the mafia being criminal by saying \"*such black and white thinking, don't you know the mafia are rich!??!?*\".   yes, we know they're rich, that's part of the problem.

second, you didn't address the point raised by /u/flyingduchman997.  that point was that *because* the chinese government is untrustworthy, promises that access will occur are no guarantee that it will actually happen.   what we have right now is a promise... and quite frankly, coming from a trustworthy government, that would be worth something.  coming from china, it's worthless.   they can be believed *after* they follow through.  not before.

third, you didn't respond to the second point raised which is that kowtowing to bullies **always** invites more bullying.  when you do what people want after they bully you, you give them reasons to do it again because you're giving them what they want and showing them how to get more of what they want.

&gt; there needs to be a diplomatic solution to the circumstances of spavor and kovrig. this will take time 

which is simply another way of saying that there won't be a solution.   if i kidnap you and toss you in a dungeon for a five year sentence and then i \"negotiate\" with your family for your release and release you in four years after your family gives me a bunch of things i want, do you conclude that \"negotiations\" with your family were successful?   

well you could and i'm sure some apologists for business as usual with china will eventually make the same claims.   but the truth would be that i successfully extorted your family for a bunch of things i wanted and **i** was successful, not you.    and also your family sent me an important message.  next time i want something, i should put another family member of yours in a dungeon and wait for \"negotiations\".

right now i need a test result within 72h to board the plane. the test i have access to takes 48 hours minimum to give me the result. i was planning to fly back on a saturday, after my last day at work that friday. now i'm wondering if flying back on a non-business day is a bad idea, in case my test results are at all delayed.

but if i wait until the week after, to take the test monday and fly back thursday, i might not be able to report to work at my new job when my 2 weeks quarantine period ends.

what if there's a storm, that delays my plane by 6-12 hours? very possible at that time of the year.

that's before we factor in the \"new restrictions\" trudeau hints at. what if i schedule my plane within 72 hours of my test, but it gets cancelled because not enough travellers? what if it gets rescheduled outside the 72 hours? what if there's new requirements between now and then that i can't forsee, and that make it impossible for me to board?

not by any reasonable definition of ceremonial, no.

\"ceremonial\" duties are symbolic rituals carried out in accordance with law and tradition, and *without* any discretion regarding how they're executed.

the gg's role as chancellor of the order of canada is a ceremonial duty - the gg doesn't personally pick who to invest in the order, but they sign off on the decision (made by an impartial advisory council), and preside over the ceremony.

the gg's role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces is a ceremonial duty (although there are a couple of extreme situations where it wouldn't be). day-to-day they don't actually issue orders, but they preside over remembrance services, sign officers' commissions, and pin (some) medals to chests.

the speech from the throne and royal assent are ceremonial duties - the gg has no constitutional discretion to alter the speech, or refuse assent, but performing it is their responsibility.

*most* of the role's responsibilities are ceremonial. but dissolution of parliament, (sometimes) prorogation of parliament, government formation, and government dismissal are not ceremonial responsibilities. they are *reserve powers* \\- they have a real force and effect, there is no other authority who can reject them, and although their use is guided by convention and precedent, depending on the situation there is always *discretion.*

a good recent example of this is bc in 2017: after losing a confidence vote in the legislature, premier christy clark asked lg judith guichon to dissolve the legislature and call a fresh election, on the grounds that the legislature (where clark's liberals just barely had the most seats) wouldn't be able to govern stably, and would be regularly turning to the speaker to break ties. guichon refused clark's request, dismissed her from office, and invited john horgan to become premier. clark's predictions about the legislature were proven wrong - a liberal ran for speaker, horgan held onto power for three years and then won a majority in an election late last year.

but guichon could have accepted clark's advice. a subsequent election might have gone better for the liberals, and she might've held onto power. there is no law saying she had to refuse that advice - just precedent and good judgement.

&gt; if the gg attempted to use the powers you described to unduly effect our democracy, let’s say because of a bias, then the ggs office would eventually be removed. 

i broadly agree with this, but it's not quite the scenario i'm describing.

i'm not describing a situation where the gg \"circumvents democracy\" (whatever that means), i'm describing a situation where a gg subject to political influence *chooses not to protect constitutional convention.* there are situations where the gg needs to be able to say \"no\" to the pm (usually in order to protect the supremacy of parliament or the structure of responsible government at key flashpoints like the midst of an election), and making sure the gg is financially independent (after leaving office) makes up for the fact that they can otherwise theoretically be removed from office at any time. it means the pm can't react to an undesirable situation by slashing the gg's pension by half, or entrap a gg by promising them a generous golden parachute once they leave office.

&gt; it would of course set off years of lawyers getting paid to figure out the details but the long and short is it would signal the beginning of the end of our current system. 

and decades of political debates as we tried to get all ten provinces on board with a massive constitutional reform, but... yeah. imo, we will never unanimously amend the constitution, so it's moot.

&gt; a gg would not be allowed to circumvent our democracy because of unwritten norms giving that position powers that have never been tested or even attempted. 

the position's powers don't come from \"unwritten norms\" though - the pm's powers do. the gg's powers are explicitly spelled out in the *constitution act, 1867.* the \"unwritten norms\" (or more precisely, constitutional conventions, which are much more than mere norms) are what the crown exists to safeguard.",liberals

guaumbn,2021-04-12T07:26:35.000-07:00,"greens out fundraise ontario liberals in q1, pcs lead fundraising so i feel like the hydro story of ontario gets mistold a lot. here's the full saga:

what killed wynne was the high hydro prices, which all parties shared a hand in but only the liberals moved to fix - and even then only under duress. 

decades ago, a pc government decided to help ordinary folks by capping hydro prices. great right? helps folks by keeping prices affordable, and industry gets a boost. win/win! 

of course, folks don't want to be stuck with big bad tax bills either, so the government declined to backstop the hydro system with tax funds. 

that meant that the hydro system had capped income, but didn't have capped expenses. as expenses creeped up over time, to make ends meet hydro postponed capital expenditure, leaving a hydro system that was rickety, frail and prone to brownouts and blackouts. by the end of harris's disastrous time in office, toronto had suffered several brownouts and a major multiday blackout. not good for folks and disastrous for business. 

neither the ndp nor the liberal governments that immediately preceded harris were keen to fix the problem - nobody wanted to be the one holding the bag on the massive costs. 

meanwhile, toronto was suffering from increasing numbers of smog days a year that put a damper on health and usefulness of canada's financial heart.

that lead to mcguinty promising to spend the money to fix the system. people were immediately on board. no more smog days? reliable electricity? what's not to love!

however, to the utter shock and amazement of ontario voters, repairing an electricity system that had been neglected for decades costs money. many voters still have not recovered from this bizarre twist. since folks don't want to pay more taxes (see above), to cover the cost of moving off of coal plants and of improving reliability, hydro rates went up. a lot. by the amount they should have increased over several decades, but instead basically coming all at once. 

this would have been bad enough, but mcguinty made things so, so much worse in terms of political optics with two big mistakes.

the first was he put his top guy in charge of the green energy portfolio. george smitherman is kind of a boss guy - an old-school, tough, gay rights activist who rose to political prominence the hard way. he also, however, does not have a lot by way of education and his high energy enthusiasm was a poor fit for the delicate work of negotiating green energy contracts. 

ontario got stuck paying top dollar for green energy over the long term as north america prices fell. it was a bad scene, and a bunch of money was lost.

then, mcguinty caved to nimby's who didn't want gas plants in their neighbourhoods, because they were swing ridings. he cancelled mostly completed gas plants at the cost of over a billion dollars.

these were expensive mistakes. they did not come close to accounting for the majority of the price increases ontarians faced, but because they were easy to understand unforced errors that got a lot of media attention. that made it easy to point to them as the reason that prices were rising - instead of the need to fix decades of neglect, a boring, tedious explanation that in any case comes dangerously close to laying blame somewhat at the feet of the voters, and we can't have that.

so, wynne got caught holding the bag. 

privatisation was an attempt to secure badly needed funding while not raising taxes, as the liberals decided that the government needed some separation from operational decisions, as there had been preciously little other than catastrophic stupidity from any government on the hydro file for decades, and the good decisions tended to be politically disastrous. doesn't make it a good idea, but its understandable. unfortunately, it alienated some of her leftist base. 

it didn't help her politically that she started taking on some of the most powerful vested interests in ontario at the same time, including suburban developers.  

the result was predictable. 

but i will always be grateful for the olp's work fixing our provincial hydro system. no more blackouts. no more smog days. less environmentally disastrous footprint. it's a better province for their work on the file.",liberals

my two cents: harper and the mps from the west.

the ghost of harper is still quite scary for the left, even for the centre. the middle-classe suburban electorate really doesn’t want to go back to this kind of leadership, so they vote liberal. they think the party is still too close to those years to jump ship for now. 

o’tool did a decent of changing the facade of the conservatives. but he now needs to work on the anti-vax, anti-abortion and think that climate change is a hoax. the country moved on, the cpc needs to move on too. a lot of the average voters in ontario and québec look at who the pcc mps are in the west and seem like they don’t want any of them to be part of a government. so they vote libs or bloc, depending of where you look at.",conservatives

honestly out of curiosity, can you provide an example of another area with high speed rail with similar population densities both at the destinations and cities in-between between?

also, if you could find location with similar climate as well (build and maintanance cost will be higher in extreme temps such as that corridor.)

&gt;for people traveling downtown toronto to downtown montreal or vice versa, a fast train would be so much better than either air travel (security, outskirts of town, weather)

for now maybe. but as someone who has taken the train, the impact of large snow falls has direct impact on the train.

also. the first time there is a bomb on a high speed train, everything will change world wide for security to get on a train. 

&gt; or car (traffic!), 

for now. with more autonomous driving capability coming, one has to assume self driving cars in 10 years at most. 

&gt; if we did build hsr along the corridor, we would also need to make sure people could get from downtown to the places they need to go for work, but that is actually pretty well covered by existing local transit.

and it sucks. i drive 4 hours to visit family because i need a car when i get where i'm going because public transit just doesn't work and is not practice, and i'm single. if i had a family, not really an option. even if i could do it in 2 hours with a train, if i need to rent a vehicle when i get where i'm going, it's just not worth it.

proposing the investment of billions for a new solution to travel, it has to be better than the current one with the ability to justify the billions in expense above and beyond current. if the impact on the trip is 1 hour in both cases, train doesn't win as the person still needs to wait that one hour.

i miss understood your statement to a degree.  however, hsr will only helps if it gets you into the core of the city which is the case for to and montreal. not applicable to ottawa or quebec city.  also, how often do you travel from montreal and arrive in to during rush hour. so, the challenge is if you get the train station in the core, is you still need to get to the core to get the train. what have we gained with hsr?

also, self driving in theory has the ability to help with congestion. but i suspect that the work from home impact of the pandemic will have a greater impact.

and that's great and i understand that. but honestly, i just don't see how investing billions into hsr on very limit number of routes is going to help your intercity travel. 

investing in rail for 500km or so travel and air travel for beyond that makes the most financial sense to me.

the interest rate banks charge is influenced by these things but it is not \"controlled\" by them. a bank can set whatever interest rate it wants for its mortgage products based on whatever it wants.

a bank uses a variety of factors for the rates it charges including the person applying for the loan in some cases. if the canadian housing market crashed then that would very quickly become a factor.

to presume the housing market doesn't have an impact should it crash is absurd. if there is a broad market crash banks will not be offering mortgages at the rates they are currently doing so.

&gt;it is impossible for a major bank in canada to face a credit crunch because they can always borrow any amount of money from the bank of canada at the overnight rate.

this is not true and also not completely how the overnight rate works. major canadian banks can also face liquidity problems, they did so in 2020 and big time in 2008

the boc sets the overnight rate which is the rate major financial institutions borrow and lend one-day (or overnight) funds **among themselves.** these banks do not and cannot borrow endless sums of money directly from the boc.

canadian banks faced a serious credit crunch in 2008 and the only thing that saved them was the impp that harper put into place to ensure majour banks could continue to lend to canadians. 

if the impp had not been implemented canadian banks would have severely restricted credit to canadians and businesses. in fact in 2020 at the start of the pandemic trudeau copied the impp to stop banks from facing a liquidity crisis.

in a large enough market crash in canada the _exact_ same thing would happen.

&gt;it is possible that banks would be stingier with who they choose to lend to, and maybe interest rates would go up, but assuming they would go up enough to make the overall costs the same seems like a completely baseless statement to me.

a housing market crash large enough to make homes affordable would see a massive liquidity crisis and banks would raise rates and they would heavily restrict lending.

the entire rationale behind free movement/special considerations for canzuk is based on \"they are countries who are very similar to us\" - they're commonwealth nations of a certain status. but you can pick a number of commonwealth nations that should fit those criteria but are excluded because they're not white/anglo enough - singapore, the bahamas, south africa - not to mention that focusing on the commonwealth to begin with excludes the significant francophone founders of canada - not to mention the first nations or other immigrants. they are all former british empire countries where indigenous populations were sufficiently marginalised to now be white-majority, english-speaking countries.  

i have nothing against the individual countries, but canzuk is fundamentally saying that we should focus more on immigrants from the \"right\" countries, either through free movement or reduced requirements. whether or not one is consciously thinking about *why* the uk, australia, and new zealand are the \"right countries\" while others are not, one still buys into the idea that there are \"right\" and \"wrong\" countries for our immigrants to come from.",conservatives

when it comes to actually dealing with the pandemic itself there is not one single thing he has gotten right. from closing down warehouses and throwing out expired ppe gear while not ordering more, to ignoring the warnings about what was developing in china. from telling canadians there was only a low risk, to saying closing the borders was racist. from telling us that masks were not only useless but dangerous, to making a deal with china to help develop a vaccine trudeau has been late and his efforts, when he eventually tried to do something, half-hearted and feeble.

canada has suffered more deaths from covid than all of east asia combined. those countries, from new zealand to vietnam, from australia to south korea, from singapore to thailand, closed their borders, enforced quarantines, and did tight screening at those coming in. they passed out masks to people early on and mass-produced more starting in january.

canada didn't even try to order more ppe gear until mid march. it was late closing its borders, did so in a half-hearted fashion with no screening or quarantines, thus letting all the variants in. it's still letting them in. instead of quickly giving a ton of money to pharmaceutical companies in canada to ramp up production so they could eventually produce a vaccine we decided to put money into a government lab, with predictable results in that it will be a year before it's ready. and while other countries were helping the big pharmaceutical companies fund vaccine development we held back, hoping china would produce one for us.

in canada, unlike new zealand, we share a border with the united states of america and depend on literally millions of essential workers crossing it every year, notably truck drivers. (there are way more of these than vacationers, and they're totally exempt from hotel trudeau.) not to mention that the virus has had a year to become endemic in every corner of society and 13 months' worth of lockdown fatigue mean that lots of people have no intention whatsoever of staying home for weeks on end unless forced at gunpoint. that ship has sailed so long, long ago.

but india is on the continent of asia. it shares borders with other heavily populated developing countries like pakistan, bangladesh, myanmar. and on top of all the same reasons why canada cannot hope ever to eliminate the virus at this point, india is a developing country in which many millions of people live in slums. not like scarborough slum, but *actual* third-world slums. people go out and hustle as best they can get something to eat *for just that one day*, and then they do it all over again if they want to eat the next day, and again and again *all through their lives*. scroll through some pictures of the kind of [housing situation](https://www.google.ca/search?q=calcutta+slum&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=579&amp;ei=ujgmyjv9hisg5nopncs4qau&amp;oq=calcutta+slum&amp;gs_lcp=cgnpbwcqaziccaayaggamgiiadigcaaqcbaemgyiabaieb46bqgaeledoggiabcxaxcdatogcaaqbraeuhzytqxg5a5oahaaeacaaccciahzd5ibbzquni4yljgyaqcgaqgqaqtnd3mtd2l6lwltzw&amp;sclient=img&amp;ved=0ahukewibuztujqfwahueefkfhr0idluq4dudcay&amp;uact=5) we're talking about here... on a massive scale. stay home? zero covid? what? seriously?

how could you possibly expect all 1.3 billion indians *including* those in that situation of desperate poverty realistically to netflix and chill for eight weeks while they hope the virus *completely dies out and literally goes extinct throughout india*? what would people even eat if they can't hustle and buy a little rice every day? where would they even poop, in slums where the river is the toilet? and no one enters india somehow during that whole time? how? what are the odds of that plan actually working out?

i've also noticed that conservatives seem to hold the belief that all tech companies are inherently pro left and silence them disproportionally which time and time again is proven not to be true. from the rate of demonetization which topics experience when they are critical of systemic issues. critiquing wars, institutional racism, inequality, etc seems to be an invitation to have tech companies reduce visibility of your content.

not to say right wing content is not also affected. the issue is going to exist as long as we maintain tech monopolies though. companies like facebook have an incentive to just keep whatever is profitable on their platform. for example on facebook consistently the top performing links are \"silenced\" conservatives https://twitter.com/facebookstop10/status/1303005558501302295, this is not due to quality but to ad spending. ben shapiro for example in 2019 was found to have spent $300,000 on facebook ads, i couldn't find 2020 numbers but if you've seen the quality of the content, it definitely it still extremely high.

solution, tech monopolies need to be broken up, facebook, google, twitter, etc are platforms which are now too large, being deplatformed can be a serious challenge because there is no competition. parler and gab, obviously crazy sites, but i think it's really impressive that they just went and made another platform. they were mocked for how they didn't implement basic security, but is that really all we need to make a functioning competitor?

treating these sites more like utilities, common services which we rely on to communicate is essential, this will remove the ridiculous invasive targeted marketing and make it actually possible to enforce standards of speech that are not rooted in ideology focused on just making as much money as possible and maintaining balance in the centre. 

looking forward to every big tech advocate to respond to push against breaking up and treating as utilities. but i would ask, what service do facebook, google, or twitter offer which could not be made easily free. they are not geniuses, this is relatively simple, the work comes into making the marketing more effective, more addictive, and more profitable. imagine if we had a wikipedia equivalent of these platforms, one where it's not possible to compete with wikipedia because the free service with no ads (they miss out on an estimated $2b in ad revenue each year) is too good.",conservatives
