if i'm interpreting this correctly, [toronto's budge](https://www.toronto.ca/ext/digital_comm/pdfs/finance/2021-budget-public-book.pdf)t has 26% of revenues coming from provincial transfers (page 39). in [the township of wellesley's budget](https://www.wellesley.ca/en/living-here/resources/documents/township-of-wellesley-budget-2021.pdf), only \\~10% of revenues come from provincial grants. wellesley is a pretty low density area (apparently only 40.5/km2), so it seems they're proving that low density can be more sustainable than high.

what about the environmental cost toronto has had on lake ontario, and the economic cost of restoring the lake?

i want to live in a low density area, and i don't want to rely on the city to subsidize the neighbourhood. i think most people who prefer those communities share that sentiment. it just frustrates me when i see people on reddit suggesting that people should just move to the city - that kind of life isn't for everyone. instead, let's talk about how we can make low density sustainable. if it's increasing taxes - fine, let's talk about that. maybe there's an innovative solution that doesn't require raising taxes? i don't know, but surely there's more options than just \"move to the city\".",liberals

it's also been run by the french since the latter half of the 20th century. since trudeau sr., every single prime minister has been from quebec, save for harper. this is because the vast majority of canadians aren't bilingual, and there is really no reason to be unless you want to work in government or you (as an anglophone) live in quebec. 

trudeau sr. alone was also able to morph canada into his vision: he was actually an ndper (ccf) who knew the ndp would never win and so joined the liberals, which he shaped into his image.

this all explains why westerners have felt alienated from the rest of canada. they have a fundamentally different history, with the majority of their ancestors being american settlers who came to the frigid frontier as part of the last best west campaign of the 1890s. they brought their american values with them. their animosity towards the east only increased after they felt like they were being scammed by the big businesses here that owned the railroads and sold their discounted product at a premium internationally, as well as when resource politics came into play.

it's impressive the number of people they've managed to piss off so quickly. i think a lot of people in alberta voted ucp knowing tough decisions had to be made, but so many of their pre-covid policies are unpopular even with their own supporters; kananaskis user fees, closing provincial parks, selling crown land, eastern slopes coal mining... the economics of these decisions are dubious at best and just piss off everyone.  


&gt; since klein's departure, the pc party had morphed into something more resembling the current federal liberal party. big spenders who borrowed to cover the shortage and more than a few scandals.  


100% agree with you there

 

&gt; the first, and fatal, mistake was trying to bring the pcs and wildrose back together.  


i always assumed that the pc element would slowly purge the wildrose elements as they were the larger more well financed party originally, and the remainder would tow the line as long as the party was popular with the electorate. i think it could have worked had it not been for covid and kenny's impressive unpopularity.

the definition of social conservatism i gave here isnt an american mold. america has no relevant social conservatism because their main thing is classical liberalism and libertarianism. that has bled into canada. we dont have a single canadian socially conservative party in canada. the chp is also one of those libertarian parties, with americanized \"conservatism\" in it.

canada was actually extremely socially conservative, and canadian social conservatism was canada's main identity. until american liberalism took over the country. it killed the deepest parts of canada. quebec, a formally catholic region, a people whose main identity was intertwined with the church, has its central identity killed in the quite revolution. that bled into the rest of canada.

the main thing that defines \"conservatism\" is its cultural and social identity. in fact its the only essential part of conservatism. out conservative party in the recent past, hasnt run under a socially conservative platform. it has run under an americanized classical liberal platform. surprisingly o'toole's platform, even with the social liberalism that he brags about, has about been the most socially conservative platform so far in the last 10 to 15 years.

false. o'toole is trying to furiously backtrack after his spokesperson was caught doing an email interview with the rebel that his own press secretary said could be attributed to o'toole and who stated, in writing, that o'toole supports the rebel being recognized by the parliamentary press gallery. 

and no, the article doesn't support your false claim that the cpc has a longstanding policy distancing themselves from the rebel. no such policy exists - o'toole did away with it. for example, o'toole's deputy leader candice bergen gave an exclusive interview to the rebel [back in september](https://twitter.com/therealkeean/status/1308977191657578503), who celebrated \"what a relief it is for the great rebel boycott by the conservative party to be over.\" the article clearly states \"the federal conservatives decided to **no longer** engage with rebel news\" and that o'toole is claiming he'll be reviving the policy going forward, not reaffirming or reiterating a policy. 

&gt; and it's important for this policy to be reiterated because there's no excuse for any cpc mp to associate themselves with rebel after the organization's clear pivot.

false. there was no \"clear pivot.\" the rebel was and has always been a far-right, white supremacist hate outlet. the cpc was happy to court the rebel's subscribers by working with the platform and only pretended to cut ties when it started costing them instead of gaining them votes. that includes scheer, who sat for multiple interviews with faith goldy well after she recited the 14 words and widely promoted her neo-nazi views, and who only cut ties after the rebel’s sympathetic coverage of racist white-nationalist protests in charlottesville, as described in the article. o'toole - who has sat for multiple interviews with the rebel - clearly had no issue with the rebel's white nationalist reporting and quickly moved to restore ties with the rebel upon being elected leader. 

if you truly believe there's no excuse for any cpc mp to associate themselves with the rebel, then you should condemn o'toole and bergen.",conservatives

there are 5,292,403 30-39-year-olds (the highest risk demographic for the side effects) in canada. 0.000072% × 5,292,403 = ~4.

of course, the 30-39 age range had more people with the side effects than other ages, so we may see, what, maybe 6 or 7 if we did every single 30-39-year-old in canada? but it's also worth noting daily cases between march 1st and april 1st went up from a 7-day new case average of 2968 to 5193, and is presently 8520 (and that 8520 is skewing younger than it was in march).",liberals

h6ihrqo,2021-07-25T06:57:05.000-07:00,"why do most people on this sub think the cpc is 'liberalite'? if you ever bothered to compare cpc and liberal policies they're very similar, they only deviate in terms of taxation, or cultural policies. this is the main reason why i initially deviated to the cpc in the first place, it was the cultural issue. canada is *losing* its cultural heritage with all this anti-colonialism rhetoric and critical theory that is militantly hostile to right-wing ideas, classical european culture, and christology (the theology of jesus). we have seen all of this unravel in the past year with blm, the burning of churches, and this movement to replace european cultural influences with those that are non-european. in the usa they call it the *browning of america*, it's this hostility to western culture as derived from europe, rather than reconciliation, and it's framed through racialised politics. 

it's quite uniquely an anglosphere (english-speaking) phenomenon. in the francophonie (french-speaking world) this isn't much of an issue, partly because such ideas are openly debated and discussed nationally, and publicly, and it isn't fuelled by an idealistic world-view that seeks to accommodate differences, rather they take a realistic and rather cynical view of, *gasp*, compatibility. the quebecois and the french figured out this ages ago that's why they're stubborn when it comes to their cultural preservation.

the problem with the cpc is that they've abandoned all hope on cultural issues and their platform is solely based nowadays on tax policies. they are not an ideological opposition to the liberals, they're just liberals who want less taxes.",liberals

i wonder how much the chinese government has to do with who applies for immigration in canada. after all, they own the company which processes the applications. would anyone really suggest they don't select a lot of people to send here to act as their stooges and agents?",conservatives

h6cweym,2021-07-23T22:13:45.000-07:00,"erin o'toole draws fire from party insiders, his own mps over staff member who works for social conservatives &gt; conservative leader erin o’toole is facing questions from within his own party over allowing his deputy chief of staff to help social conservative candidates secure party nominations.    
    
&gt; the star reported thursday that steve outhouse, o’toole’s deputy chief of staff, has been paid by nine people seeking nominations to assist their campaigns. the majority of those candidates are from the social conservative faction of the conservative party, as is outhouse.      
     
&gt; seven party sources — all outside of o’toole’s team but who have experience in conservative governments — told the star that having a senior staffer in the leader’s office moonlighting as a nomination campaign consultant is highly unusual.    
     
\"works for\" makes this sound a lot more legitimate than whatever cash for nominations shenanigans outhouse was running.  
   
the oldest trick in the book is to find \"social conservatives\" (or whatever group you think will support you), fill out a membership form with their name on it, ask them to sign it, throw it in an envelope with enough cash to cover 1 year memberships costs, and then follow up to make sure they vote.

h6cwrfr,2021-07-23T22:17:59.000-07:00,"pierre trudeau ahead of harper as best recent pm for canadians chrétien is seriously underrated in this poll (while the trudeaus are overrated). it is worth considering just how bad things were in 1993 when chrétien took office.

1. canada was coming out of a deep recession, with unemployment [around 11%](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-005-m/75-005-m2016001-eng.htm) (higher than in 2008). at the same time, the deficit was sky-high - interest on the debt took up 25-30% of the budget.
2. the constitution wars of the 1980s saw secessionist sentiments surging in québec - parizeau was about to become premier. 

chrétien navigated canada through a period of twinned economic and constitutional crises. on the economic front, he made tough but necessary cuts, freeing up the central bank to cut rates (weakening the dollar, but helping exports). in time, as growth increased giving canada surpluses, chrétien and martin would be able to raise spending and cut taxes simultaneously (without harper, martin would have been able to deliver on plans for universal child care). further, by rejecting bank liberalization, canada would later enter the 2008 financial crisis with the [most stable banks in the world](https://www.thestar.com/business/2010/09/09/canadas_banks_rated_most_stable_in_the_world.html).

on the constitutional front, he likely saved canada - if kim campbell/preston manning/audrey mclaughlin were pm, the yes side would have won the referendum. and then he passed the clarity act. by the end of chrétien's term in office, separatist support was greatly diminished (adscam would provide a revival, but even then, while the bloc gained, the pq - which could potentially launch a referendum - did not). 

internationally, chrétien also made broadly wise decisions. he kept us out of the iraq war. and his government also launched a global ban on landmines that has saved the lives of thousands. 

oh and he started the process to legalize gay marriage (implemented by martin) and marijuana (which martin was not able to implement). 

chrétien was not perfect. the liberals rightly paid a price for adscam. they had their share of bungled files - e.g. the billion dollar boondoggle on the gun registry, and some wrong moves (hepatitis compensation - they should have done the right thing there). and while chrétien signed kyoto, his government did not manage the climate file well. still, if you think of where we were in 1993 vs. 2004, you've got to hand it to the little guy from shawinigan.",liberals

h6cy3w8,2021-07-23T22:33:38.000-07:00,"does canada have any leadership standards left? this reads more like spencer fernando (who describes himself, hilariously, as \"one of the most popular and prolific political voices in canada\") being shocked to discover that many canadians aren't conservatives, than it does any sort of incisive analysis of the current government.

rather than taking the fact that most canadians are generally okay with how the feds have handled covid as a chance to reasses their own beliefs, they instead decide that canadians must be bamboozled by a \"controlled media\" to be \"okay with repeated incompetence\".
