hcjikwe,2021-09-11T18:46:11.000-07:00,"views on the ndp? well i consider myself to be somewhat of a red tory but im a bit all over the map per say. more libertarian than authoritarian. 

singh has some stuff in his platform i like such as right to repair (pg. 20), protecting the ei account from being a source of revenue (pg. 26), stricter methane regulations (pg. 46), supporting retrofits to indoor air quality (pg. 48), hydrogen fuel cell development and zev incentives (pg. 49), pension protections (pg. 63).

the problem isnt even really singh either. at the english debates he spoke plain...english. he didnt sit there and spew word salads. if anything, it was funny watching him get trudeau all wound up. yeah his woke antics rile up the occasional person, but he has to keep his supporters happy.

the problem lies in the system itself. i would highly doubt if canada could fund a gli without increasing taxes, that you would find opposition to it except in some corners on the right. i would dare say most on this side of the spectrum would be okay with pharmacare, dental, and expanded mental health services. something beyond a pity party hotline. 

thing is to pay for these endeavors, now you are taxing your working class and professional class to the hilt. people will always retort this with \"have you read his platform? he wants to tax the rich.\"

our country is 1 trillion dollars in debt. the other line that then gets brought up is \"yeah but-government debt is different than household debt.\" true. but. if we cant service that debt we open ourselves up to a whole new can of worms: spiking interest rates, bank runs (when people move their money out of national banks- almost like capital flight), devalued currency, trade embargos, and unemployment.

if it was that easy to tax extreme wealth and the rich, it would have been done already. as long as there are countries out there that can be tax havens, and because due to how humans really are, there always will be. now that revenue disappears instantly. when you start raking your trades workers, medical professionals, and first responders over the coals to pick up the tab, it gets to a point where if your skills are needed and you can build a better life elsewhere, well, why not? canadas and north americas standards and qualifications for a lot of jobs are high, and in some cases, are even sought after internationally. thats why we have doctors from other parts of the world delivering your skip order. because their tickets mean nothing here. not that i dont find some disgust in that myself personally. 

so now not only has your high tax bracket payers fled, your working class is pulling up roots too. your hospitals are screwed. nothing gets built unless its to a de-rated standard, and thats if theres even enough people to do it. the ones who are left are the ones that cant afford to leave.

of course-things could get worse from there. but even the scenario ive explained can happen here. not saying that it would either.

so its easy to promise all kinds of free ice cream and puppies for all. especially when you have a 10% chance of forming a minority government. the problem is the system is purely rigged in favour of some, and not very many others. it doesnt help we shoot ourselves in the foot constantly shutting down our resource based economy. so we peasants get to choose every few years-wanna pay more for some more stuff, or wanna dial it back and save a few?",liberals

there are some things you said in this post i would like to chat with you about. i'll be engaging with you in good faith, because there is some stuff i am going to disagree with you on. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;i mean, the fact that he was able to prevent a liberal majority is pretty amazing. 

it's hard to give the credit to him on that. there's a stronger case than can be made to give the credit to yfb and the bq for preventing a liberal majority. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;it seems like this sub is a bit on the extreme right.

what do you believe the 'extreme right' is? i do not genuinely know what you mean, since it's thrown around so often these days. 

&gt;first of all, a carbon tax is necessary if we want to fight climate change, we shouldn't politicize this.

i believe in climate change and i am a supporter of cap &amp; trade, but i disagree with you that carbon taxation is necessary to fight climate change. there are a lot of different approaches to lowering carbon emissions, and carbon-taxing happens to be one of them. others would include incentivization, subsidization of green energy, a regulatory approach, tariffs on big polluting countries, etc, etc. 

anything we do in canada is largely symbolic. canada could cease to exist, and our lack of emissions wouldn't make a dent in climate change. canada's best means of fighting climate change is by exporting our technologies and being ahead of the curve on green tech, among other things. 

...there's also stuff like québec powering the us east coast with green energy. the québec-ny deal on supplying power to ny will do waaaaay more than carbon taxation alone ever would. 

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;second, about the guns, if we want to save many lives then we need to take the may 2020 gun law

if we want to save many lives, we need to go after illegal guns (largely smuggled in from the usa) and actually combat gun crimes. going after law-abiding gun owners won't do diddly squat.

hhxky3l,2021-10-24T11:05:59.000-07:00,"trudeau would have been \"better served\" to listen to party's old guard, says chrétien &gt;chretien basically \"balanced the budget\" using extremely short term thinking, continuing to sell off what was left of publically owned companies after mulroney.

all chretien did is put federal spending closer in line to where it was historically before trudeau and realistically he didn't have much of a choice. between the 1950s to 1960s, canada's federal expenditure was constantly around 14-15% of gdp. there's nothing wrong with raising it above that, but trudeau sr's budgetary policies were incredibly short sighted and raised long term spending 6-8% of gdp above revenues. this left behind massive debt servicing costs for mulroney and chretien to deal with that made up over 90% of all debt incurred between 1984 to 1997 (meaning that less than 10% of all debt between that period was incurred by the incumbent governments) since operating budgets remained constantly balanced between 1987-1996.

between 1985 to 1990, the government response was to incrementally raise revenues while incrementally reducing expenditure. this was initially successful and halved the initial 8.1% of gdp deficit they inherited in 6 years, but it was derailed by the early 90s global recession, which meant that debt servicing costs skyrocketed between then and 1995. this basically left chretien/martin with no choice in 1995 besides the route that they took.  their actions were not short sighted in that regard, they were pragmatic and evidence driven. if debt servicing costs were not curtailed in 1995, they would have taken up 25-30% of all expenditures between the early/mid 2000s and taken a huge chunk out of expenditure that would other wise be going to program spending. (not to mention the issues that would come with a massively downgraded credit rating).

&gt;worse than that, he downloaded a ton of responsibilities to the provinces without granting any additional taxation powers

[provincial expenditure as a percentage of gdp](http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/canadian-fiscal/prov_fiscal.pdf) wasn't radically different in most provinces before 1995. ontario's expenditures ranged from 16 to 20% of gdp between 1990 to 1995 while spending as a percentage of gdp between 2005 to 2019 was around the same.

&gt;and combined that with enforcing free trade.

free trade is objectively a benefit for canada as a whole. you'd honestly struggle to list a single country presently with high living standards that does not have highly liberalized trade.  or to find countries that have objectively raised their citizens incomes or living standards via protectionist measures and were able to sustain that.

&gt;basically all of our problems today are a result of this. housing unaffordability? look at how much is spent on public housing since chretiene.

this has far more to do with zoning and land use regulations from municipal and provincial governments than it does with the federal government. zoning/land use restrictions have dramatically constrained housing supply in the face of rising demand. policies like single-family zoning in particular have also greatly reduced the diversity of the housing stock and combined with nimbyism in general has made it much more difficult to build more unit and multi-family housing, which makes it much harder for lower and middle income people to break into the housing market and live and work in the areas where the highest paying jobs are etc.

planning systems in regards to land use and housing are objectively one of the biggest (if not the biggest) contributors to income inequality across advanced economies. federal governments in canada and the u.s share some blame, but the majority of it lies on municipal governments. the feds themselves can do very little to address the issue. public housing on it's own does not even begin to remedy the larger problem and chretien himself is not more guilty of canada's failure on housing policy than pierre or justin trudeau, mulroney, harper or any of the prime ministers in the past half century are.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;health care? look at the amount of icu units per capita since chretien. public transit? non existent outside of big cities.

those are provincial and municipal issues.

&gt;now we get to deal with an entire generation of impoverished canadians strapped with debt due to sky high rents

there's more household debt (almost entirely due to higher houseing and rental prices) and inequality in present day canada, but [poverty](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/34/canada_low-income_rate.png) (as well as [child poverty](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/d0v3fd_uuaaez0o.png) and [the percentage of low income tax fillers](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/sites/default/files/topics-poverty-indicator-lowincome-entry2021-eng.jpg) ) is lower and [living standards](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/sites/ca.canadian-index-wellbeing/files/uploads/images/c011676-ciw-nationalreport-lvgstds.jpg) and [median incomes](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-at9repe0egy/unl3vipvrxi/aaaaaaaac8w/hgftuyvofxc/s1600/canadian+total+median+income.jpg) are all higher than they were between 1980-1995. there's a lot of things that canada could do better and there's still a lot of issues with poverty and inequality that need to be addressed, but overall we're better off than were 25, 30 or 50 years ago.

&gt;even if you disagree with all this, at the time, chretien really wasn't that popular. him and martin benefited massively from a fractured right wing that split the vote

the conservative vote share between 1993-2011 was actually slightly higher than it is now. the liberals under chretien at least won over 40% of the vote in both 1993 and 2000, which no government has achieved since. (the last before that was mulroney in 1988).",liberals

it's not as simple as that if course, sometimes it's just not appropriate, but do you honestly feel singh is literally praising the authoritarian aspects of castro and the worst of his life choices?  it's specifically about the revolution and doing something about oppression.  pre-revolution cuba was brutally racist, and the difference between the large number of poor and the privileged classes was extraordinary.

i don't care what leader of a country or nation you want to discuss.   if we are holding to the standard praising one thing is praising everything, let's agree to apply that standard universally.  are you prepared to do that?

i don't approve of castro's regime's brutality or authoritarianism.  i respect and agree with this tweet and what it is specific to say.

the christian heritage party of canada is socially conservative, as are its provincial wings like the christian heritage party of british columbia. it has no seats in the legislative assembly.

alberta is the most socially conservative province. the wildrose independence party in alberta used to call for the adoption of a currency to replace the canadian dollar, so how relevant could it have been? it  has merged with the pcs, which became the united conservative party. the ucp is a relevant provincial political party. however, how socially conservative is it? its leader has hinted at positions that are anti lgbt and anti abortion. but nothing solid really. jason kenny is perhaps the most relevant \"socially conservative\" politician at the provincial level.

the people's alliance of new brunswick has two seats and about 8% of the vote, so how relevant is it? and in any case, it is not that obviously socially conservative. 

the ppc is a populist party at the federal level. i'm not sure whether it's active in provincial politics. bernier has expressly stated that this party does not have lgbt and abortion issues on its agenda. in any case, it didn't do well at all in the recent federal election. i would say it's an irrelevant party, although it generates a lot of heat. i am assuming your definition of social conservative does not include a hard-line anti-immigration position or anything related to qanon.

there is no active and relevant socially conservative party in ontario that fits this american-sounding mold. maybe a few tory mps hold these views privately.  there has been a party or two in the past, but they are defunct.

nb clergymen (and women?) have served as mps in every party in canada. canada is not into religion and public morality the way that americans are. religion and politics are not intertwined.

controversial issues like gay marriage, abortion, etc. were not political issues in canada. they were legal battles, not political battles. these issues were decided by the courts, sometimes after protracted litigation. the govt (regardless of its stripe) then implemented or acquiesced to the courts' rulings.

this is also not true. 8 of the last 14 elections during minority parliaments have been called by the government. not because the opposition lost confidence in the government. the truth is that governments call elections during parliaments mostly on their own accord. the most you could claim is that it's roughly 50/50. so again, completely 'usual'.",liberals

i think the rest of canada should help alberta and saskatchewan transition to a less fossil fuel dependent economy, and insofar as oil production continues, find ways for it to be greener. even from an economic standpoint, this isn't sustainable. canadian oil is so co2-intensive to extract, it is going to become a very easy target for other countries seeking to reduce emissions.",liberals

so yeah...
nothing happened like i said.

unless you consider this: 

\"

canadian prime minister justin trudeau has denied any involvement in the affair, saying he had \"entirely and completely been transparent about mine and my family's finances. that is something i learned early on that canadians expect from their leaders.\"[5] canada revenue agency said in a statement that its current tax evasion audits include \"some canadian clients associated with law firm mossack fonseca,\"[6] and added that it would \"communicate\" with its treaty partners to obtain any further information that may not currently be in its possession.\" the cra has tax treaties with 92 different countries and 22 tax information exchange agreements.[5][6] the cra has begun or completed 116 audits and 234 more are planned. these investigations are expected to recoup at least $11 million in taxes and fines. fewer than 10 related criminal investigations are in progress.[7]

the royal bank of canada (rbc) denied any wrongdoing associated with the 370+ clients it had referred to mossack fonseca over the years.\"we have an extensive due diligence process... rbc works within the legal and regulatory framework of every country in which we operate,\" said a bank spokesman.[8] ceo david mckay said the bank will review the four decades of documentation for any problems.[9][10] ceo bill downe of the bank of montreal said \"canadian banks have 'dramatically' beefed up anti-money laundering control over the last seven to 10 years,\"[11] and added that any link between canadian businesses and the panama papers companies would have originated a long time ago, before canadian banks took action to stop money laundering.[9]

some individuals did surface in the leaked documents, according to icij partner in the investigation toronto star.[12]

    john mark wright, a mutual fund broker, had three shell companies in the british virgin islands for handling profits from a mine in the democratic republic of congo.
    eric van nguyen, a montreal resident with registered companies in samoa and another in the british virgin islands. he also faces fraud charges in the new york state in a penny stock scheme.[13]
    brian shamess, a sports physician from sault ste marie, used a mossack fonseca company to buy a condo on panama bay in 2011.
    eric marc levine operates fitness clubs in asia and has registered at least 15 companies in the british virgin islands through mossack fonseca. the thai anti-money laundering office froze some of his business assets following fraud allegations; levine responded with a defamation suit.
    former newfoundland cabinet minister chuck furey incorporated in panama to buy a condo in 2008. he said no longer has overseas holdings.
    mixed martial arts trainer dave feser of vancouver set up a business in british anguilla with an office in switzerland. \"there's nothing even associated with this company,\" feser told the star.

canadians for tax fairness had calculated that legal tax avoidance by corporations alone cost the canadian treasury almost $8 billion canadian a year.[14] when it calculated the 2015 numbers, they found that corporations and individuals combined sent can$40 billion of declared assets to tax havens, and the ten most popular alone now held $270 billion canadian in assets.[15]\"
