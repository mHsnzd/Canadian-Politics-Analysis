on the flip side, though, genuine new ideas are rare, and other than the recent rise of the nb and pei greens / new options for our generation, it's mostly a contest between coke (pcs) and pepsi (libs). with your grandma voting for team pepsi determining your vote for team pepsi.

i mean just because we have beef with the government of china doesn't mean that should bleed over to their citizens. we can take issue with sending ppe to *any* country (that in hindsight we really needed) but we shouldn't take issue with sending it to specifically china. 

vaccine is a total other thing, had it panned out and china was first the deal would have put us at a huge advantage. obviously there are other factors to consider, but to me the country to first see the virus, and a country with massive resources like china seems like a pretty good place to bet. we gambled and lost.

no, absolutely not. try getting anything related to construction, home repair, cars, or major appliances right now. you simply _cannot_ get some of it, and some of it is weeks or months behind. supply lines are completely screwed as covid slowed the entire world down, from manufacturing to shipping to distribution. prices are rising as a result of that. try getting a quote on some home renos. they can only guarantee you the prices for about 2 weeks now, because by the time they get materials it's gone up again.

food has also suffered from [supply chain issues](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-08-31/hunger-is-threatening-to-kill-more-people-than-covid-this-year), with enormous amounts being left to rot as it either couldn't be moved or they could not import workers to pick it.

housing is out of control because people saved money during the pandemic and interest rates were low, but not lower than after the gfc. the pm does not set the rates. the independent bank of canada was raising rates prior to 2020 but cut it during the pandemic. this is kind of the move when you are literally in a disaster. a [quarter of millennials](https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/millennials-bought-home-covid/) bought homes during covid. it was the perfect storm of increased savings and low interest rates. they're finally buying in their mid to late 30s because they saw the opportunity. that had nothing to do with trudeau. the localized housing issues in vancouver, toronto, and a few other cities have municipal and provincial solutions and broad federal solutions would have been unwelcome in much of the country.

you can argue that the spending influenced rates somewhat if you want. but there really was no choice there. cerb was needed. millions would have been homeless without it. resetting millions to zero, interrupting education, increased crime etc is not something that you can recover from easily.

pinning it all on government spending and interest rates has no basis in reality.

what defines him in my eyes is someone who is moderate by nature but swerved right to obtain the cpc nomination. that (a) is cynical and (b) shows a lack of conviction, but it's hardly unheard of. perhaps people didn't have much of an opinion about him at all but defaulted to \"dislike\" because, after harper and scheer, they had just presumed he was more of the same for the cpc.

when people see him, they seem to like him better than they were expecting to. i think this means he's the one to look out for in the debates this year. if he seems moderate, personable and *human*, watch out.

for the life of me, i'll never understand this line of thinking. there are clear differences between the parties, but to lump the bloc in with the others is also so asinine. need i remind o'toole that the bloc québécois and his québec-wing of the cpc have a tremendous amount in common?

he apparently has some uk tory advisors in his ears. one of those advisors should tell him that david cameron ran a successful coalition government with the liberal democrats.

canadians aren't going to suddenly embrace a conservative majority, and in the unlikely event he ends up with a plurality of seats in a hung parliament, he should be looking to work with the other parties, not insulting them.

it could, but thus far it has not shown an appetite for the quasi-coalition arrangement necessary for this kind of concrete policy win.  both the ndp and the plurality party (cpc, lpc) have seemed content to accept bill-by-bill cooperation, losing out on some measures in order to retain undiluted rhetoric.

and even in a coalition arrangement, the ndp would have to accept this in lieu of some other attractive policy platform.  maybe extend federal labour protections, but give up on dental care.  

in the current climate, i don't think that would be an attractive position for the ndp.  its social policies are probably the higher-profile, vote-winning items, so if forced to make a choice it would be rational to sacrifice the pro-labour policy.

worse yet, as far as i know \"pro-labour policy\" isn't even succinctly defined.   based on the collective public-policy statements of various unions, the \"pro-labour\" position seems to involve a wholesale left-social-democratic platform on everything from bargaining rights to social services to foreign policy.  an \"ndp fulcrum\" plan needs to have some focused policy wins in mind, and based on even this article i think a \"narrow win\" would be interpreted as failure to make progress on broader issues.",liberals

they were spooning, after a date night in, after multiple other dates, in bed at night. 

should he have asked before groping her? probably, in retrospect. but is it inherently some nefarious sexual assault where he was being a predator? i don't think so.

it isn't to say he wasn't wrong and didn't make a mistake, but this kind of thing does happen (spooning leading to sexual touching) and it does happen without a lot of verbal discussion often, so it's not like he's some predatorial guy. 

there's a big difference between the boss who pulls up their employees skirt, someone who drugs another person, and someone who misreads the consensual cues up to the point where they try to initiate sexual activity and then ... stop when they get told no.

again he should have asked for some sort of confirmation that she wanted sex first, but for most people until recently the mantra was no means no for ages not enthusiastic yes. and this seems to be a scenario where he respected the boundary and really misunderstood the situation and made a mistake - that yes is big but no, i don't think is criminal and enough to ruin a young life over. 

not unless he had drugged her or acted in any sort of predatorial manner. 

this reads to me like an early relationship where he went too fast and they hadn't appropriately set boundaries yet as a couple. it's not her fault mind you, but it's not like he should be painted a sex offender for it either. what he did wasn't criminal and honestly doesn't point to any sort of seriously problematic thinking or depravity.",liberals

it’s not important in the sense of being a recurring issue, since to my knowledge the class-like compensation ordered in this case is novel for the chrt.

it’s not important in the sense of being precedent-setting, because administrative tribunals like the chrt are not bound by their past decisions in the same manner as courts. and anyway, being a creature of statute, the government is free to amend the chrt’s enabling legislation to clarify the limits of its remedial powers in future cases.

hct9jc0,2021-09-13T22:35:57.000-07:00,"protests at trudeau rallies an evolution of far-right ideology, says expert these generalizations are very concerning!!!

they're basically saying that anyone who seeks out campaign stops to engage with or protest politicians is now worth discounting. you might not even be protesting the same thing as the person who threw rocks, or has a racist dog whistle sign. you might be as dismayed as the rest of us by those things. but the fact that you are protesting in the same space somehow makes your message automatically worth ignoring (and makes you a bad person). 

protesting at campaign stops is a time-honored tradition. it's a way to get visibility for important causes, and often one of the few opportunities to know that your message will be seen by a person in power. that is a valuable thing for people across political spectra. 

i'm not a huge protester, but have been to enough marches and protests to realize that they are awkward and slightly chaotic events at the best of times. in any larger protest, or in any protest that isn't for a very well-defined cause with a very well-defined protocol (and even then!), you may have have a few random people acting inappropriately. some people actually seek out protests for the opportunity to do so, for the joy of chaos-making; some people do the same to act as agents provocateurs and hurt the cause being protested. it's something that organizers plan around, and try to dissuade in various ways, but can't necessarily prevent. this is especially true in situations where movements are less organized - something that is common in nascent movements. if you dismiss anyone participating in a shared protest on the basis of their \"association\" with people doing bad things, you're basically going to dismiss most protests!  

for what it's worth, cbc ignores and/or mischaracterizes leftist protests and issues on a regular basis, too. they talked about blm protests primarily through the lens of the us protests (though many were organized in canada, some by long-time canadian activist organizations!), and used super dismissive language (about \"clashes\" with police, etc.) without contextualizing who was doing the bulk of the violence. they *barely* even covered the climate marches that happened a couple of years ago, even though some of these were enormous. they treat leftist activism with some of the same tactic they are now using to cover anti-vaccine-mandate and related marches: cover the ones that involve violence or reprehensible acts, and ignore the ones that don't, thereby creating a heavily skewed picture. 

for years now, the cbc's coverage of protests has delegitimized them. protests are an important means of expressing dissent. delegitimizing them undermines our democracy.",liberals

that is probably the biggest difference and most important. conservatism (cpc brand or ppc brand) can't grow if every social media account, board, sub-reddit etc are shutdown, and that is precisely what the lpc intend with these laws.

why do we need new or different regulations for social media?

people are allowed to stay stupid things. people are allowed to say mean things, so long as these don't reach thresholds we have defined as unacceptable (such as inciting violence). people are allowed to say things that are not true. people are even allowed to lie!  

these things might seem bad - indeed, they can be. but the alternative is to allow government and/or social media companies to censor speech: to decide what is and isn't true (good luck with that), what is and isn't mean, etc. letting people in positions of power decide what the masses can and cannot say is a recipe for totalitarianism.",liberals

america modelled themselves on the roman republic with its weaknesses in mind and created very strong institutions and a ironclad constitution. this gives the people ability to take back power after a crisis is resolved.

canada does not have particularly strong institutions and while i like to believe that no in parliament has the desire to bound us in a dictatorship,  these things happen very quickly and suddenly. and when they happen, you cannot expect to be dealing with reasonable men.

things are different now. people aren't as afraid of the uncertainty of covid. the \"crisis\" is largely over and if there's a fourth wave it'll be seen as sort of 'botching the response that should have been under control'.  normal campaigning is more possible. people will be less likely to overlook the opportunism.

h1ehwyo,2021-06-10T23:47:12.000-07:00,"the annamie paul train wreck gathers steam &gt; the big issue that's bringing the green party down is that it was largely the elizabeth may party

that is a mis-characterisation common among people who only know about the green party from the outside. some of this mess is in fact, perhaps, may's fault.

the green party pulled ahead of the other also-rans not under may, but her predecessor, jim harris. 

jim was an interesting guy who brought manic energy and focus to the party. he came up with the basic plan for the gpc's strategy for the 2000's and 2010's:

1) the platform should account for everything, but focus only on environmental sustainability. the point of the party is that the world is in peril and immediate action is needed to prevent catastrophe over the next century. by definition, everything else is a distraction. we need to be able to deal with distractions, but must not fixate on them.

2) the perfect is the enemy of the good. emergencies call for concrete steps that are achievable now, not discourses on utopia. the platform should propose the least radical and most achievable steps for the most radical results. this was the basis for him shifting the greens hard to the centre and proposing carbon taxes/shifts as opposed to eco-socialist revolutions.

3) in the political persuasion game, there's no such thing as a wasted vote. if people are more likely to vote for parties that already have support, than every vote anywhere in the country is a step towards persuading someone else to join the campaign. he insisted on running candidates in every riding, no matter how unwinnable, so that election results would show the true extent of nation-wide support. 

he won first 2% and then 4% of the popular vote - a massive surge over the &gt;0.5% the greens routinely got before him - and more importantly, perhaps, won media attention with his energetic, continuous campaigning. 

when elizabeth may took over, she wanted to \"do politics differently\" but, unlike trudeau, didn't understand why that was actually a bad idea. she opened up the platform even more than it had been to \"the grassroots,\" allowing a decentralised process for party policy.

the predictable happened. orphan quixote causes, many of them bizarre and definitely not focused on the environment, swarmed to the greens as a platform from which to scream their message. palestinian liberation activists, anti-divorce activists, men's rights groups and others started filling the platform with mountains of distractions - and the media caught on. suddenly, may found herself defending her party's position on things that had nothing to do with the environment. she got so frustrated she nearly quit. 

now she has stepped down, but her legacy in the form of armies of fringe cause activists and extremists remains. in the quest for openness, the party has become an unfocused and divisive organisation. 

may is a talented leader and politician, and could hold the party together despite this. as their first elected mp, she had stature and respect. ms. paul does not have may's acumen or stature, and now the party is falling apart. but the foundation for this disaster was, i think, laid by may. the problem with paul is that she has not understood or addressed the problem, and has allowed herself to be paralysed by the chaos in a leadership team that cannot, evidently, even agree on what their core purpose or identity is.",liberals

having said all that... this is a test that only non-christians must pass... you can be an extraordinarily devout, super conservative, catholic (or protestant) family judge who will totally side with the abusive husband or allow neglect of the lgbt child, and not be at all bothered by bill 21 since today's christian standards do not call for anything banned in bill 21

however, if you were a nice, loving muslim math teacher who has covered her hair all her life and would chose to continue to do so even if nobody is forcing her to... now has to face leaving a job she loves or changing her custom because somehow numbers don't add right if a teacher's hair is showing

the point i am trying to make is that:

1) in practice, this is a law to beat religious minorities with as it will not affect, in any meaningful way, the vast majority of people in quebec

privatization and neo-liberalism didn't bring us the prosperity it promised, military interventionism/adventurism (more a feature of american/european conservativism than canadian) has created more problems than it's solved, and as women's/lgbt+ rights have increased and society gets more culturally/sexually liberal the sky has not yet caved in.

understandably, not all conservatives in canada want to go down that route. this is a good thing. but the issue is that no real alternative route to the above has been articulated so the moderates are those desperately holding on to a failed orthodoxy because, well, it's orthodoxy. a parallel can be drawn to the brezhnev years in the cpsu except they prevented any alternative from forming in the party at all via suppression.

&gt;  
&gt;in alberta and saskatchewan, premiers jason kenney and scott moe were vowing that the supreme court ruling on thursday was far from the end of their crusade against carbon pricing.  
&gt;  
&gt;“we are not deterred,” kenney said. “while the supreme court has determined that prime minister trudeau has the legal right to impose a carbon tax, it doesn’t mean he should,” moe said.  
&gt;  
&gt;maybe we will actually have to stop the car.

yup, the federal-provincial (and provincial-provincial) bickering has definitely cost us. why the f\\*ck should it be illegal to buy a case of wine or truckload of lumber in one province and not be able to bring it home in another? why are our provincial governments using taxpayer money to wage what is essentially a political campaign (vs the carbon fee) via the courts? why can't construction workers, or engineers, or many professionals, from one province get a job in another? 

most of the blame lies with the provinces. each premier wants to put protectionist rules in place, or beat up ottawa to look tough, like they're \"fighting for their province\" but in reality it's only hurting everyone. 

i am glad the supreme court ruled the way it did, but it is only a small chip off a problematic iceberg. why do we keep rewarding provincial politicians that act like they rule their own little fiefdom? we have to start punishing the politicians that do this. if not, we can't really have nice things...whether that's a cross-canada smart electric grid, robust domestic industries, national daycare program, professional credentials recognized outside your own provide, and 1,000 more things.",liberals

the doublespeak in the corporate world as it relates to the environment is unreal. people love calling something ‘clean’ but the actual truth is that they are still promoting terrible policies to advance ulterior motives. all i see in this report is loose language, zero specific facts, poor comparisons and a result that tells me it will be good for the environment. they don’t show the work because what this plan actually does is help wealthy people more than it helps the environment. instead they just focus on one result. 

an aside, but a good example: i wanted to be an environmental lawyer, then, in law school, that class was taught by someone who worked for husky oil. turns out, about 95% of lawyers who focus on the environment are employed by energy companies. they are experts in how to navigate around environmental regulations, and they do nothing to help the environment in any way.

&gt;now you're saying it's people owning multiple properties, and vacancy rates, yes?

you stated previously that there is a housing supply issue.  i am responding to that by saying there isn't a physical supply issue, it's an issue with at supply being controlled by a smaller portion of the population.  showing the actual vacancy rate at the end of 2020 further supports my statement that there is still significant supply to house people.

&gt;you're wrong on every count here, but this is completely off the topic at hand (housing/construction). so i'm going to skip this.

if i am wrong on every count then please explain why you think that.  

my whole agreement is pretty simple. construction companies/sites have been a fairly significant vector for covid transmission, and if the government was truly interested in stopping the spread than they would be shut down as well.  someone made the comment about 500k/year (actual government plans are just over 400k in 2021) coming into canada as a result of the aggressive immigration policies adding additional strain to the current housing crisis.  https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/trudeau-s-plan-to-ramp-up-immigration-falls-flat-with-canadians-1.1518817

guqvce2,2021-04-16T03:17:50.000-07:00,"conservatives unveil loyalty-card style of carbon pricing the one benefit i can see in this glorified pc optimum card is to help people actually plan out their way of reducing emissions. it's the height of nanny-state intervention of course, but since when did consistent principles matter. the liberal plan does give a carrot and a stick to cut emissions, but it doesn't guarantee that people will spend the rebates on green renovations or hybrid cars. that would be the economically rational thing to do, but people aren't bounded by the laws of econ 101. the tory savings plan, while inherently intrusive and bureaucratic, kind of forces you to spend on emission-reducing products, which is probably not the worst goal.

however, this doesn't make sense when combined with a lower carbon tax rate. the less you pay, the less you get in your carbon savings account, and the tories want you to pay less, the knock-on effect being that you get less in your savings account. so if you're a farmer trying to save up for green tech, you're worse off under the cpc plan. at least with the liberal carbon tax, you get a rebate every year (i believe they're making it every three months next year). you can do whatever you want with that money, and the increased cost of gas is offset to a certain extent. with the tory carbon savings contribution rate (or whatever they call it) set so much lower, you're going to have to contribute for many years before you can cash in on new equipment. if you're a city slicker trying to spend it on a $400 bicycle, sure, you'll get that money quickly. if you're a farmer looking to buy $40,000 worth of low-emission equipment, you're gonna have to wait a loooong time, and in the meanwhile you'll effectively be paying more tax. i'm sure the average wheat farmer in saskatchewan would rather just not have a carbon tax at all, but between a tax that at least gives you a rebate vs one that promises potential returns many years down the line, i don't see why the latter would be preferable (not saying rural sk will start voting liberal, obviously, but with such a low contribution rate the tories are not even helping the people their plan is supposed to help).

i commend o'toole for at least putting something forward, given how half of his party still refuses to even acknowledge man-made climate change (edit: and how scheer refused to put forward something even resembling a serious ghg reduction policy). it's the best climate plan the cpc has put forward to date, and hopefully as time goes on, they keep getting better until climate change ceases to be a partisan issue. but leave it to the conservative party of canada to design the silliest version of a carbon price, and one that betrays their principles (more regulation, more bureaucracy, government telling people how to spend their money, etc)",conservatives

because it's her life and it's her decision.  no right is absolute, you are entirely correct.  but the *only* instance in which they are abridged is when you exercising your right to the full extent infringes on the rights of another.

hell, that isn't even an example of religious freedom so much as  bodily autonomy - how the hell do you rationalize forcing an adult citizen to undergo a medical procedure they have not consented to without a damned compelling argument for a social good?

a grown woman can, in good conscience, refuse a blood transfusion knowing it will lead to her death.  she probably shouldn't be able to say the same for her minor child who is unable to consent.  you do not have the right to force your wife to wear a hijab when she goes out in public, but i can think of no compelling argument for why a  woman should not be free to decide to wear one for herself.

employers that are outside of the previously mentioned industries, should also have the ability to employ this program. everyone _must_ be vaccinated to come into the office, have a real need for exemption or work remotely.

ftfy.

i disagree with the idea that doctors can refused to provide services like abortion, and medical aids in dying, but since not every doctor is qualified on every procedure, i'm not going to fight it, since we have a system in place for when doctors can't provide services their patient needs. the referral system. 

when someone attempts to handicap that system, like o'toole is suggesting, but saying that doctors don't have to refer patients, because they disagree with the treatment, that i will fight. an individuals moral objections, don't give them the right to impose suffering on someone else. a referral is not performing that service, and places no moral obligation on the doctor referring a patient. refusing a referral, is failing to care for a patient, and failing in their professionalism.

o'toole may think this is him not taking a socially conservative position, but he's wrong. it's not as hardline as the social conservative may want, but it still meets their ends more than the mainstream, that believes in bodily autonomy.

&gt; during a 2019 ontario court case, services to which various doctors' groups and individual physicians said they would object included abortion, contraception, tubal ligations, vasectomies, infertility treatment, prescription of erectile dysfunction medication and gender re-assignment surgery, as well as assisted dying.

wow, the regressive nature of social conservatives, is worse than i had thought.

&gt; allowing doctors to refuse to provide referrals for those services would stigmatize already vulnerable patients, leave them to navigate the complex health system on their own and restrict their access to medical services, he said.

forgot to mention that bit in my initial tirade against o'toole.

overall, i don't see much daylight between o'toole and scheer from the social perspective. they're both social conservatives, and want to take rights away.",conservatives

that's probably not correct. we sure aren't going to get there by being \"no name liberal substitute\".  harper 2.0 is exactly what we need to win. 

being just another harper isn't the right course, but taking what people did like about harper and then adding to it is exactly what we need. fiscal responsibility can be a huge selling point if you do it right - people like it. they don't like hacking and slashing eveyrthing, but they do like ideas that increase jobs and wages and business opportunity and help secure their future.  that is absolutely sellable. people are afraid of our overspending. put forward a reasonable and responsible plan to get back to prosperity and people will respond. 

if you sell the idea of letting the provinces manage themselves it's actually quite popular especially in places like quebec. the bloc is basically like the conservative quebec party - it vanished when harper was around because there was no need. you can appeal to quebec (and alberta and bc and sask) by supporting the idea that provinces should have the power to be provinces. 

the problem with o'toole is he made it sound like a cop out instead of a feature. 

then you step up the game, and do some things harper didn't. reach out to the center on some key issues, like daycare and the environment. and you can sell that to conservatives - we need women in the workforce earning money. canadians are demanding an effective climate plan and we aren't going to get to represent all the people as gov't without one. 

the last thing we need is to be the old pc party and we saw just how effective that was in winning over the major urban areas - they'll just say 'oh - so the same as the libs. well, might as well stick with the libs then\".  we lost seats in those key areas.

sounds to me like the problem here isn't that the ndp underperformed, but rather that the electoral system in this country is criminally underrepresenting the people who do vote for the ndp, and grossly overrepresenting liberal votes. it's one thing i wish singh was more vocal about in this campaign because i feel like there is a growing disillusionment with voting that is in part stemming from the fact that any progressive option in this country is muffled out by our grossly inadequate fptp system.",liberals

i think it speaks to a number of issues they have in terms of the urban rural divide. and mind you this urban rural divide issue isn't just a cpc problem, it goes the other way too for the liberals and ndp somewhat. but they at least are able to run diverse candidates because of the urban areas they do well in.

frankly we'd do better as a country if we could figure out the urban/rural divide better. and one small step could be the cpc being more diverse in their areas of traditional support in more rural ridings. even if its running more indigenous or mixed ethnic origin folks.

i know they tend to run a lot of east asian, mostly chinese iirc, folks out west. but they all got decimated in part because of a variety of things that pushed the east asian community away.

&amp;#x200b;

\\- anti-china rhetoric from the cpc (maybe a bit too strong) probably stoked fears of anti-chinese racism (covid did put it on the upswing),

\\- poor covid perspectives (chinese folks are very aware of the collective and so being prudent on covid is important to them)

\\- weak stance on lgbtq issues (aside from the socon population in the chinese diaspora, this wouldn't help, and i question if that being the single issue for socon chinese folks given points a/b previous taking over their concern).

the ndp and singh are not in touch with quebec culture. for example, tweeting \"just watch me\", pierre eliott trudeau's famous words before declaring war measures in quebec, sending in the tanks, and arresting anyone without any charges based on affiliation. the rest of canada might not remember it, but there's a generation in quebec that vividly remembers seeing soldiers in the streets stopping people and searching houses. this will in no way win you votes in quebec, it's incredible that the ndp campaign even let him tweet such a thing.

another losing proposition of the ndp is their penchant for strong centralization. the bloc's purpose is de-centralization, towards a true federation, and it's not a mystery why such a party sprung up in quebec. ignore that sensibility at your own party's peril.

finally let's talk about the elephant in the room, law 21. singh is not in defiance of law 21, law 21 does not apply to elected positions. yes singh's religious symbols may displease people, in quebec as in everywhere else in canada, so that doesn't explain quebec's reluctance to vote ndp (there ain't any ndp seats east of montréal!). but, laicité is popular in quebec as in many western democracies, it's not the human rights violation that so many try to make it out to be. you won't win any votes in quebec by trying to impose your own morals which you hold as righteous, there's a long history of that in quebec, and the population sees it as neo-colonialism.

i have explained my views clearly: statues are meant to invite worship or reverence of their subject matter. they have no other role that can't be filled by pubic art or a garden, which all provide more to the community than a statue of a dead person. hell, a hot dog stand does more for the local community than a statue; it creates economic transactions and feeds hungry people. a statue.... takes up space. so unless that statue contributes to good citizenship or beautifies, it's worthless.

in fact, all three parties have proposed giving the cra more money to increase tax-law enforcement, and all of these policies have been costed by the pbo.

the [ndp](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/en/epc-estimates--estimations-cpe?epc-cmp--eid=44&amp;epc-cmp--cid=171) would give the cra $100m/yr and collect about $2bn over 5 years between direct enforcement and indirect honesty, net of the additional expense.

the [liberals](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/en/epc-estimates--estimations-cpe?epc-cmp--eid=44&amp;epc-cmp--cid=120) would give increasing amounts to the cra, beginning with $250m in 2022-3 and ending with $1bn in 2025-6.  it would improve revenues by a total of $14bn over five years for a net $11bn.  (noting the pbo cautions about whether or not the cra can in fact increase enforcement this quickly with any efficacy).

the [cpc](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/en/epc-estimates--estimations-cpe?epc-cmp--eid=44&amp;epc-cmp--cid=154) would ramp up enforcement at a slightly slower rate, from $100m to $750m, collecting $9.2bn in additional revenue for a net $7.6bn.

perhaps ironically, the ndp budgets the least for pure enforcement.

&gt; i do think the $12b on tax havens though isn't too farfetched when you consider that close to $250b is hidden away on tax havens.

the \"tax haven\" item isn't exactly the panama papers.  instead, the party [proposes](https://www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/en/epc-estimates--estimations-cpe?epc-cmp--eid=44&amp;epc-cmp--cid=162) adding an \"economic substance\" rule for cross-border payments, where a company can only deduct a payment to a foreign corporation if it can prove the payment was for economically meaningful activity.  this is intended to crack down on some corporate tax avoidance by routing revenues throw low-tax jurisdictions in the form of licensing or ip payments.",liberals

but it's becoming very hard to read criticism toward that law coming from english canadians become half the time any valid point is served with a copious amount of unchecked francophobia, and coming from a majority that had no qualms oppressing us for the majority of this country's history is... well, it's gross, and it's sending the message that anglophones don't really care about discriminating if it's against a target they don't personally like. it also makes the job of anti-racists working \\*within\\* québec much, much harder because it gives ammunition to proponents of the law who will claim that everyone else in this country hates us so why should we bother to listen to what they have to say anyway.

and yes i do know that not \\*all\\* ~~men~~ anglophone canadians are like that but a  very vocal section of the roc is and that's a huge problem that's setting back the fight against every form of xenophobia in this country. so if you claim to be against xenophobia and you're a francophobe, you need to realize that you're deliberately setting back anti-racism progress for everyone because we're all interconnected and the more types of people you learn to respect, the easier it makes it to build a kinder society.",liberals

i think people underestimate this group as a key political demographic currently and going forward.

\"normie\" canada used to be a lot more small-c quiet traditionally conservative, i think, even up into the harper years — which is what he built his coalition of voters on to take him into office. but due to generational turn-over, increasing urbanization, the dynamics of social media, climate change and climate denial, the progressive progress and normalization around lgbtq issues and other cultural/social progressive issues, the evident issues with and dangers of conservatism that have been on display and ever-increasing during most of gen x, millennials, and now gen z's lives, etc. has led to a situation where the general default political disposition of much of the country has shifted.

this normie centre of the country is still small-c conservative in a strong way, but it's just what they're conservative for now is mild liberalism.

this situation creates an even greater structural advantage for the liberals than they had before. i think previously a lot more voters in this normie middle could flip conservative depending on the election, but abc voting and people increasingly seeing conservative parties as a fundamentally non-viable option is *very* ingrained now among many. and with a charismatic popular leader who projects an image canadians want to feel about themselves, it's a walk in the park for the liberals to continue to form government.

i think a wealth tax, despite its downsides, is something worth taking a look at. raising resource royalties like u/cyclonesweep might also make sense. capital gains tax is another, we currently only include 50% of capital gains in the tax so increasing the inclusion rate would increase revenue. that said, i don't think most tax increases are a particularly good idea during the midst of an economic recovery.

most of the government's revenues come from three sources: income tax (by far the biggest), corporate tax, and gst. gst increases are politically toxic across the board, no government will do it. corporate tax increases are popular, but usually get passed down to consumers, and raising corporate taxes on restaurants and brick-and-mortar stores right after the pandemic is not something i would support. this leaves income tax - problem is, raising it on the higher brackets doesn't raise much revenue, and lower brackets have the same problem as the gst - politically toxic, hurts working and middle class people.

edit: if the goal is not to raise revenue but to clamp down on the banking oligopoly, a little tax isn't gonna do shit. the government would either need to break the big banks, or establish a public lender. i don't see the liberals doing either of those, so if the goal is to actually reduce the power of the big five, increasing taxes has as much of an effect as pissing in the ocean",liberals

\"take/get the most, perform the worst, bitch the loudest.\" 

heres a well written comment from u/lemmingpractice

in 2018, alberta was going through the pipeline crisis, where albertan oil prices dropped to all time lows (hitting a low of about $6/barrel before notley was forced to take the unprecedented step of capping oil production in a free market economy). yet, in that same year, the province was one of only three net payers into confederation (bc and ontario being the other two), with alberta having by far the largest net contribution per capita at $3,995 per person (bc was second at $2,042 per person). in a time of economic crisis in alberta, they were still the province with the highest federal government revenue per capita and the lowest federal government expenditures per capita.

also, just a bit of perspective there, the pipeline crisis in 2018 was caused by trudeau cancelling the northern gateway pipeline in 2015. oil sands production levels are set 5-10 years in advance, so anyone with a calculator who cared to know knew that pipelines would exceed capacity by 2018 if a new pipeline weren't opened (and there is no doubt that trudeau was told this by dozens of oil lobbyists and advisors).

so, tldr, the federal government, under trudeau, knowingly caused an economic crisis in alberta, and while that crisis was going on, still took the highest taxes per capita from the province while sending back the least expenditures per capita to the province. if you don't think that situation justifies a bit of complaining then i don't know what to tell you.",liberals
