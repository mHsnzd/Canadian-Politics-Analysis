look no further than ontario where a sitting mpp is currently inciting violence against other mpps: https://twitter.com/suzemorrison/status/1444706385246236677?s=21

yet there’s nothing anyone can do until the next election. the pcs have already kicked him out of caucus yet he gets to remain being an independent mpp spewing his anti-vax bs and calling for violence. as far as i can tell, there isn’t even a process provincially for ontario to expel rouge mpps. at least i can’t find anything when searching. funny enough hillier himself proposed a recall system awhile ago which could now be used against him if it was implemented.

as for vuong, i think the best approach would be for the liberals to approach the ndp (who i assume will favor recall legislation) and propose a recall measures. pass it and then let the voters decide if enough of them want to toss vuong. this could also be a good measure to prevent against radical mps from winning with extremely small margins (under 30%) due to vote splitting. imagine if we had a ppc mp come up the middle when 70% of the riding didn’t vote for them. that would be ripe for a recall so they could have someone who actually represents them.",liberals

interesting tidbit - \"a\" vs \"an\" is actually based on pronunciation, and *not* spelling. this means that although you would normally use \"an\" before a vowel like \"o\", in this case you don't. this is because \"one\" is pronounced with a consonant sound at the beginning (\"won\").

this is the same reason you get some weird quirks around abbreviations. for example, you would use \"an lgbtq organization\" rather than \"a\", because the letter \"l\" is *pronounced* by starting with a vowel sound (\"el\"), whereas you could still say \"a little problem\" because the word \"little\" is pronounced beginning with a consonant, even though both words start with the same letter when written.

yeah, neither side will accept a peaceful one-state solution.

a singular state will require it to be a secular state. israelis fought for decades for a jewish state, even moderate israelis wouldn't accept losing that jewish state, let alone the current netanyahu government. if the one state continues to be a jewish state, then palestinians will be even more upset because it will just feel like an israeli takeover. in all reality a one-state solution would just be an israeli takeover because they have more money, a sustainable governmental infrastructure, and far better military.

not to mention, how would you guarantee peace in a one-state solution? hamas has a lot of popular support among palestinians, and they're not just going to stop attacking israelis. israel won't want to accept hamas into their own backyards. the israeli government understands that they're much better off leaving hamas as an idf issue and not a domestic one.

that's why the international community has always aimed for a two-state solution. but historically, palestinians have never supported a two-state solution. israel had in the past, but now that the nationalists are the clear majority in israel, there isn't popular support in israel either. many nationalistic/religious israelis believe that all of judea should be their land, and most palestinians believe that british palestine was stolen from them. it's a matter of leaving both sides unsatisfied.",liberals

as for your second point, being lied to by the government doesn't absolve the voters of their actions.  in a democracy, the people hold the reins to political power.  they are the ones in charge, and so all the shit that happens, whether good or bad, is ultimately on them.  it's just the tough shit rule.  if you're in charge and bad stuff happens, tough shit.

in the 2020 leadership race i ranked o'toole 1st and mackay 2nd (and left #3 and #4 blank). i honestly didn't care who won the leadership, because both were really conservative in my opinion. 

then look at o'toole over a year later, he has abandoned every single key conservative principle. his 'true blue' campaign was bullshit and he should never have done the smear campaign on how \"mackay is liberal-lite.\" in fact, o'toole is the liberal-lite one. i could imagine mackay fuming right now.

people have deep suspicions and doubts about modern industrial society - and they're right to, because at the end of the day, the whole thing is set up to benefit the wealthy few and to feed the worst impulses of human nature. the far right mobilizes these feelings very effectively despite not really offering anything different, for example donald trump's great con game. the liberal consensus mobilizes fear of the far right to encourage conformity. this in turn pushes the anti-conformist (the kind of person who is *less* likely to do something after being told to do it) toward the right, who play into this very cynically. and the game continues, all for the benefit of the owners of capital and those most privileged by the state/capital complex.

i am vaccinated but i can hardly blame anybody for not wanting to be. people fundamentally *do not trust* anything they hear, and they are right to be distrustful. most people don't have the education to know what they should and should not trust - so they distrust it all. would it be better if they just trusted it all instead? well, we could mobilize a pandemic response a lot more effectively, that's for sure, but what else could we mobilize more effectively? could that trust be *mis*-used? i'd argue that for the greater part of industrial civilization, it has been.",conservatives

[npr covered](https://www.npr.org/2021/07/30/1022827659/three-reasons-for-the-housing-shortage) this consulting some economists. it's not pulled out of my ass. it's a common opinion among economists. as well the key issue is the consultation process before projects can go ahead. the boomers brought that in.

&gt;so, you want people to be more engaged, yet you bemoan that boomers show up to vote, slightly more regularly than anyone else. you want them to vote less?

the boomers going to die off within the next 20. the younger people just need to realize their municipal votes matter on this topic.

&gt;it's absolutely not just tangential. have you not been paying attention to the skyrocketing real estate value all over the country, as people flee the big cities for cheaper residences? or do you think everyone who moves to new brunswick is in their 30's?

people aren't fleeing the cities, some of the people who would have bought in the cities compromise by buying nearby but not in the city or those who can work remote move further. the cities are still growing. 

as well other reasons the prices have sky rocketed are also the chronically low interest rates which drive up demand from all demographics.

&gt;you think the problem is that single detached home development is toronto's problem? or are you talking about the suburbs, which obviously are not the downtown core? sorry, you need to clarify that.

i'm saying metro cores should focus on building up and denser. 

&gt;really? you are talking about one of the most populous cities in the world, and in the last 50 years has grown from 11.5 million to 13.5 million people. why don't you find a city that has had tremendous population growth over the last 50 years, also preferably in the west.

what's you point here? you don't agree that tokyo currently has enough housing units and that is due partly to a different development process which doesn't include consultation? new york also got denser before a consultation process was required. 

&gt;also, you want to blame boomers as if they are the ones who are desperately trying to maintain the value of their homes. let me help you out here. i'm not a boomer, i'm gen x. since i have been living in my current home, it's value has increased at least 250%, probably closer to 300%. 

i am also gen x who owns a home with only a little bit of a mortgage to go. i work remote so this topic has no impact on my life aside from being tangentially related to my job.

&gt;you are simply following the internet trend of blaming the boomers, when the reality is everyone is to blame.

they've been doing the nimby for their entire home owning lives; the net effect is cities have under built housing units for longer than both our lives which is major cause of the current problem. it's not the boomers protecting their assets, that's what they believe they're doing. what they are actually doing is keeping neighborhoods in stasis against any change. this has led to sprawl when it was possible and now it drives sky rocketing prices. this is not their motivation but is the effect of their decisions over their lives as home owners.",liberals

$25 co-pay to see your doctor, $50 co-pay to see urgent care and $100 for emergency. i think that will be an incentive to see your doctor first and the user fee can go back into upgrading equipment at the hospital/clinic/doctors office. unclog the emergency room.

hdif8b9,2021-09-19T07:04:27.000-07:00,"erin o’toole or justin trudeau? monday’s loser won’t survive as party leader let me start by saying that i don't entirely believe in loyalty of the party to someone who isn't actively winning. all the things above have been true for as long as trudeau has been improving the standing of the liberals and eventually winning elections. 

but now, there's no upward mobility under trudeau left; those who are loyal to him are already in positions of authority, meaning that new faces finding open places inevitably take them from someone trudeau has previously relied on. and everybody who gets elected wants a position, be it cabinet or otherwise, because they ran in order to govern. the longer trudeau is there, the more internal tension there is and the more people who have asked him for placements and been refused.

in addition, the liberal party members might be who decides whether he stays, but the voters are the ones who decide if he succeeds. with the right backing he could hold the leadership forever, but that would instead be at the cost of dragging down the party. and none of the members will have that, because that drags *them* down. 

in my opinion, if he comes out of this election with fewer seats than he went in with, he'll step down. partially because he would want to go out on his own terms, and partially because he knows that staying would see the \"loyal\" party members slowly start to turn against him. but it's just my opinion, in the end, and we only need to wait a couple more days to find out for ourselves.

though i could very much see him remaining leader for another year or so in a minority situation while laying the groundwork for his replacement, he won't just flip the desk and go of course.",liberals

**secondly you ignored the fact that bc has had a carbon tax since 2008** and their emissions have risen ever since.   don't pretend it was just implemented - its been over a decade.  and yes, bc's emissions rose every year since!

i don't mind a tax at all, but pretending the carbon tax tackles climate change is delusional.  you know who really is behind the push for carbon tax, the 100 companies responsible for 70% of global emissions - they don't want regulation, they want to shift responsibility away from themselves.   they'd rather the populace think ordinary citizens are the problem.

by the way stephen harper passed the first environmental legislation since mulroney's acid rain act, because there was a decade of liberal inaction in between.   but ask yourself what did harper have to pass if provinces are taking the actions themselves?  during his tenure he should have and could have done more but what did he do?  his governments did invest plenty into green technologies, into carbon capture technology and innovation.   did you know that environment minister rona ambrose introduced a law that would use the federal government’s constitutional authority to require all industrial sectors to reduce pollution but it was opposed by the liberals and ndp?   do you not recall that flaherty's 2007 budget included $4.5 billion for reducing greenhouse gases and to combat climate change?   do you not recall baird's proposal to give companies the possibility of meeting their targets by paying a $15 carbon tax per tonne of emissions that would go into a fund supporting the development of new technologies?    all this actually useful stuff was drowned out by those delusional enough to think making a citizen pay a carbon tax to heat their home or fuel their car was better for the environment than actually doing tangible things that impact the real source of pollution and holding the biggest polluters accountable.",liberals

we was a bit more legit in that the sole-source was questionable for sure, but the scandal never really materialized into anything substantial as the arguments were 'well trudeau's mom made some money' when fees for speaking were pretty much on-par with established norms, and then we quietly vanished.  it's more like a 'well it could have been a scandal.'

imho the objective of these 'exposing' these so-called scandals isn't to build a frame that promotes the cpc as virtuous.  it's to build cynicism and apathy in canadian politics.  ie.  the status quo.

though at the same time, the political climate isn't the same in every country. the conservatives in the uk have constantly payed attention to climate issues since thatcher and even with 10 years of conservative rule the uk still implemented a carbon tax and did more to lower emissions than many other advanced economies in the eurozone etc.

in canada's case, think most of our issues with climate policy started after 1993 since the reform party largely sabotaged the conservative movement and talking points federally while it's base also slowly started infiltrating provincial politics over several decades as well. if the reform party only got the same level of the support of the old federal social credit party and the pc's maintained their position, there'd probably less of a voice for denialism in  the mainstream political climate presently.",conservatives

gw55fu7,2021-04-27T15:56:31.000-07:00,"o'toole muses to virtual crowd about mandatory voting, looking to australia i've long been a proponent of mandatory voting, and to see so many people here opposed to the idea is disappointing, and annoying, to say the least. i would've hoped we would have more faith and trust in our fellow canadians.

in light of everyone's hot takes, i decided to go looking for some actual studies on the impact of mandatory voting in australia, and came across [this paper](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/westminster_model_democracy/files/fowler_compulsoryvoting.pdf). i've only skimmed it so far, but it has interesting points. 

&gt; before the implementation of compulsory voting, australia was similar to many advanced democracies today. less than 70 percent of citizens voted in federal or state elections, and wealthy citizens were much more likely to vote than working-class citizens.

...

&gt; when near-universal turnout was achieved, elections and policy shifted in favor of the working-class citizens who had previously failed to participate.

without mandatory voting, turnout tends to favour the wealthy elite, which in turn results in policy decisions that favour those elite, which then further disenfranchises the working class, only amplifying the problem. with mandatory voting, the formerly non-voters must now vote, and political parties adjust their platforms appropriately to cater to those previously underrepresented voters. the result is an overall shift in political policy, mostly in favour labour related issues.

the fact that o'toole is the one suggesting mandatory voting is bizarre, as it would not be likely to favour the cpc. but that the ndp types here are against the idea is even more bizarre, as this is something that would in all likelihood increase ndp voter share, or at the very least shift the overton window a big step to the left, which i would see as a win.

i was already in favour of mandatory voting before reading all this for mostly different reasons, but this research only makes me support it more. remember, mandatory voting doesn't actually mean you must vote, it just forces a greater level of engagement, which can still mean you can decline to vote. it makes not voting an active choice, and not one made out of apathy.",conservatives

why, in a country that is made up entirely of immigrants (unless you are indigenous), do you feel the need to be “patriotic” and “nationalist”? what does “nationalism” mean to you? 
if it means anything other than an embrace of the multiculturalism upon which we were founded, then you don’t understand the history of this country.

i have given you clear reference that “western values” is a known racist dog whistle. you can choose not to believe it, but that does not make it untrue. anyone familiar with the rise of the alt right and white supremacy will be familiar with the phrase. and no, you can’t say people calling out racism are the real racists, that’s not how that works.

if you honestly require more information, it’s a frequently mentioned trope in the anti-semitic conspiracy theory of the [great replacement](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/countering-radical-right/great-replacement-theory-historical-perspective/)

&gt; yet, demographic conspiracies should not be seen as fringe enterprises restricted to gullible extremists – they have an increasingly mainstream appeal. crucially, they feed into wider ‘decline of the west’ narratives promoted by mainstream right-wing and conservative writers who argue that nefarious elites are purposefully undermining the majority’s ‘way of life’. indeed, conspiratorial language has become an important rhetorical style for populists and their supporters more generally.

sound familiar?

&gt; honestly i can’t believe trudeau got re-elected

me neither. i don’t understand why you ppc folks think if we oppose the fascism of the ppc we must be trudeau die-hards. the neo-liberal policies of the liberal and conservative parties are a big part of the reason why so many people are turning to fascism. but that is not a reason to embrace fascism.

4. othered; of color; considered as having a race, as contrasted with white people when considered as not having a race.  - [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/racialized)

i'm not a personal fan of the term either, it feels like an americanism like \"people of color\" (which, intellectually i understand isn't meant to be racist, but it still sounds to me like 1960s america calling everyone non-white [\"colorued people\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colored)) compared to canadian terms i was more familiar with, like \"visible minority\" or \"immigrant communities\". it's also kind of an inherently negative word, as per the third and fourth definition.

personally, when i hear \"racialized\", i get the sense it means \"recognizing and believing oneself to be another race from the default\". in that sense, i actually have a feeling that many \"white\" people are being \"racialized\", in that i would say there is a trend of people who identify as white feeling like there is distinct \"white identity\" which is its own identity, distinct from \"canadian\" (e.g. [\"it's okay to be white\" signs being posted at canadian universities](https://globalnews.ca/news/4623611/its-okay-to-be-white-signs-posted-at-university-of-manitoba-faxed-to-native-studies-office/)).",conservatives

maybe, just maybe, the answer is to stop making everything about race and start looking at the people in those groups as... well, people!

there's as much diversity amongst every ethnic group as there is amongst white people. all black people don't vote the same way. all indian people don't vote the same way, etc. so why are we promoting narratives that dehumanize people and create the impression that they're some mindless monolithic bloc?",conservatives

so below are some general observances, but again, some conservatives differ on these matters. 

poverty by many conservatives in the us seems to be regarded as based on moral failing or work ethic which feeds into policy to eliminate any social support. most conservatives in canada regard a social safety net as a requirement in society regardless of poor work ethics. both still see the idea that it is not the government's job to redistribute wealth.

if it comes to pure unbridled capitalism vs regulation of capitalism, conservatives of canada will lean more towards some sort of regulation than their american counterparts. it will still be asked if regulation is still needed.

currently most canadians would agree that there is not a truly conservative television network. previously newspapers such as the national post would have been regarded as conservative but have for the most part changed direction due to relying on liberal government funding. perhaps the sun or rebel media but many of their presentations are very editorial of previous occurances. 

religion does play a role for both, but it's not to the same degree as the united states. it's not seen as requirement in canada to lead as being christian.

in canada, especially in urban areas, there is a large stigma against conservatives, as simultaneously being uneducated disorganized racist rednecks while at the same time being nefarious scheming centrally planned capitalist nazis. canadians generally want to avoid confrontation in everyday life so most conservatives just don't talk about their views publicly. which seems to be a much different approach to conservative americans would handle this perception. 

conservatives in canada also disagree with their us counterparts on being populists. in canada populism is actually part of left wing approach to get elected. it's really seen as a disgusting as it lacks integrity. 

and it's obviously not true of either conservatives in the us or canada as being widely bigoted. in canada, the conservatives have elected homosexual, muslim, and others that share the conservative views. so when leftists in canada smear conservatives in this matter, their ignorance is quite apparent, and their appeal to liberal populism is just vulgar.",conservatives

because that’s what’s happening. it doesn’t matter how big an effect crb has on labour supply, i think it’s inarguable that it’s had some effect.

i’m not terribly sympathetic to a lot of small business owners. i think many have this entitled attitude to a captive labour pool who should have to put up with whatever bs conditions / wages they offer. i agree that no one has the right to own a restaurant. and i suspect the reason many aren’t raising their wages is because they’re essentially hoping they can wait out crb and avoid establishing a higher de facto minimum wage.

if you start a business you have to take on risk. but it’s not unreasonable to expect that the government won’t intervene in a way that advantages your most powerful multinational competitors, and makes it impossible for you to forecast labour costs.

i get the sense you think the crb is good not only as a tool to respond to covid but as a way to raise wages and improve working conditions? if that’s a desirable goal (and i agree it is) the govt. should increase the minimum wage. it would still advantage bigger companies but at least would create greater certainty for smbs to make decisions and plan for the future.",liberals

indeed. but we're talking about a complete collapse of the cpc, in which case beauce has shown itself open to the ppc with polls favouring bernier multiple times both during the 2019 and the 2021 elections.  beauce has _never_ shown itself open to the bloc even in 1993, which is already the only example needed as the counter to \"those conservative seats will all go bloc\".  and trust me, beaucerons aren't the most immigration happy people in the province.   

bernier isn't seen as a traitor. the bernier name in beauce is an institution, his own father was a beauce mp who became independent after splitting off from the federal conservatives. maxime ended up doing poorly in 2021, but the conclusion you drew from that is simply wrong.  

&gt; has a reputation especially in montreal for being hostile to minorities

no

&gt; there's a reason immigrants and anglophones in quebec don't go there

it's not a big city(tm) and its french.  immigrants and anglophones aren't settling in gatineau for the most part either despite its location and its englishness and, despite having a population twice as big as gatineau's, quebec city is seeing 4x more immigrants as of the second trimester of 2021.  

&gt;  this anti-immigrant vote is likely to go bloc rather than liberal in an election where the bloc cranks up the anti-muslim rhetoric

again, we can draw all kinds of conclusion from our ass, but those ridings simply have not shown a voting pattern going in that direction despite a particularly weak cpc and a particularly strong bq that has hitched its wagon to the caq/bill 21. the bq seems to be capped while we know that the plc and ndp (although they seem shot for now) have a lot of growth potential in there. it's not like i wouldn't like to see the bq pick up more seats, but the quebec region simply isn't the place where its going to happen; chicoutimi is the only riding i can see having a significant cpc -&gt; bloc exode.  

not only that, but anti-immigration sentiments aren't widespread in the province if we go by any metrics. it hasn't been a very important variable in 2019 and 2021 despite bernier's best efforts to bang on the \"mass immigration\" drum and it won't be an important variable come next election bar some sort of unpredictable shift.  

this is /r/canadapolitics, not /r/canada : go by actual polls and measurable trends, not by stereotypes  

&gt;  it's all liberal now. it used to be all seperatist except for chomedey.

i have no clue why you decided to go from a referendum map to a federal election map instead of just taking 2 federal elections map.  it's is incredibly hard to follow what you are trying to say when you pull random subjects from all over the place. if we look at comparable data, that is federal results to federal results, laval has never been a bloc stronghold with 4/8 seats there at their strongest in 1993 vs, say, 1/7 in 1997. so did laval massively diversify in 4 years?

&gt;one would think these are a net positive economically and socially

i don't deny that there's merit there but i'm saying it's not nearly enough to compensate for the entire spending spree right now. especially since the federal government has ignored the pbo and the boc, of which both accounted for spending for the pandemic, and all recommendations were exceeded spectacularly.
would the weed policy even offset the increasingly expensive and baseless policies similar to the proposed handgun bans and oic of assault weapons? the added revenue is unlikely even to cover the cost of running administration expenses not to mention the compensation for taxpayers who responsibly use firearms. 
i understand that politics is about compromise and it's not always perfect but the policies of this government is like riding a roller coaster. 

&gt;new childcare deals

it's not new. it's been in place in the province of quebec for over 20 years and parents are on waitlists due to lack of availability and 

it's a great idea and i agree with the sentiments you have regarding it however as federal spending increases so do taxes and inflation. there's a point when you have to stop spending and start prioritizing where public money should be spent and where it should not. if this federal child care is a priority, then where can the country afford to take cuts? seeing as the ministers took two raises and a bonus since the beginning of the pandemic. let's start with our elected officials. businesses failed, people got laid off across the country, and those on salary took pay cuts. 
the us has had a significant economic growth during the past years and typically, canada sees a lot of that growth as well. this time, it wasn't as much as it usually is compared to the us market. i'm still reading as much as i can about what the finance minister is trying to do but there's a lot of conflicting articles and opinions out there so at least you can assume it's a gamble to spend this much.",liberals
