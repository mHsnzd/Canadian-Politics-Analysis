support for residential schools could have, very, unfortunately and wrongfully been argued from a universalist, paternalist, progressive, or other perspective, and that goes to show you canada has a lot to reflect on when it comes time to this sorta stuff.

i should also correct myself and say that while toryism is the dominant founding ideology of canada, it doesn't fairly give the founding liberals enough credit, as a number of our fathers of confederation were members of the liberal party &amp; parti rouge as well.

i will say this, the paternalism baked into canada's early toryism probably very strongly encouraged the adoption of a residential school system and assimilationist policy. there are obviously toxic and benign manifestations of paternalist policies, which i shall get into when i answer the other questions for you.

if the liberals do reasonably well in eastern canada, they can expect around 80 seats in ontario, 40 ish in quebec and 26-30 in atlantic canada. so about 145-150 seats in eastern canada. 




they‚Äôd need another 20-25 seats ish in western canada (they already have 15).

2. having a bigger presence in parliament is granting bigger legitimacy under an elected democratic system. duh
3. afd currently have the power to be the kingmaker in germany. or at least, one of the two parties that can be kingmaker. that is a lot of power. 
4. nazis were fringe in 1928. they got 2.63% of the votes in 1928 and were awarded 12 seats. as we see, its extremely unlikely and virtually impossible to win 12 seats in a parliament with 2.63% of the vote share in fptp. ie, with fptp that seat count would've been lilkely 1 or zero. therefore, pr is what gave the nazis greater presence
5. giving more seats and greter presence in the parliament to the fringe == inherently more unstable an outcome. we don't want the far right or the far left to have greater slice of the political pie. if they do, then things become unstable and there is plenty of historical precedence of political unstability leading to social unstability created by greater share of power to the fringes. 
6. the germans do have a stable government despite the pr system allowing the modern nazis to have more power. this is because the nazis aren't legitimised yet. they will be, in another 10-20 years as they continue to occupy a sizeable share of power in the reichstag. 
7. snap elections are a facet of the constitution, not what system we have. usa is fptp. they don't have random snap elections. india is the largest and most politically diverse democracy on the planet. also fptp. they don't have snap elections either- they can only do so, if the minority govt falls due to vote of no confidence - the dominant partner in a minority govt can't just call snap elections willy nilly. these are all facets of a more or less robust constitution, nothing more.",liberals

&gt; you‚Äôre assuming small business could survive in those scenarios and that people want businesses near their homes.

this isn't an assumption, it's a current observation. historic neighbourhoods in cities like toronto and london and montreal are built exactly this way because historic shops are grandfathered, thus avoiding the zoning issue. these areas are also extremely popular places to live. we also know it can scale because entire european cities successfully use this design.

what makes this an overnight fix is that it doesn't depend on other systems to change. if you relax zoning in a suburb then someone can open a grocer or barbershop or restaurant out of a home there tomorrow. we also know that they can and will do so, because such businesses in residential areas exist in the sparse areas they are seen as highly popular and desirable, even in canada.

&gt; nothing which relies on human behaviour gets fixed ‚Äúovernight‚Äù.

nothing which relies on *changing* human behaviour gets fixed overnight. but if a lawn is getting destroyed by people cutting across it, adding a gravel path fixes the problem overnight because you are playing into existing behaviour rather than trying to change it.

zoning is similar. people already want to live in mixed use neighbourhoods. people want to go for a walk near their house and stop for coffee and pick up milk/eggs on the way. people want their commute to be a 10 minute stroll in a low traffic area. people want to open shops where other people live. the overnight change happens when you relax zoning because the behaviour already exists, it is simply prohibited by zoning. if people wanted to live in suburbs with no shops allowed, then we wouldn't need zoning laws to force those places to exist, because the market would already sell what they wanted. zoning laws restrict the natural human behaviour. that's why zoning is an overnight fix.

conversely, transit and evs are not overnight fixes. they require systemic changes (building transit and reducing sprawl for transit, and grid improvements, recharge stations, lowering prices for evs). they also require behaviour changes (improving the public perception of transit, being okay with longer and limited refueling options or higher prices for evs).

**edit** note regarding my comment about evs/transit not being overnight fixes. i still see these as important and even essential changes we have to make, i just think they'll be harder and take longer than fixing zoning.",liberals

popular mandates and plebiscites have their place, of course, but i dont see value for society in letting everyone have a say on every topic - i only see detriment. or rather, the negatives outweigh the positives, in my opinion.

now on a moral question - very simple; society giveth, society taketh away. morality is a construct, and it can be changed. today you have a right to vote, tomorrow it was decided to remove that right. the end. 

on tests; a little trickier. at a minimum, a voter should demonstrate the ability and basic knowledge of the causes and effects of actions that will result from the vote. so, if one is asked about a tariff policy, one should know what the ripple effects would be, in economics, in diplomacy, in jobs, etc. one should see the whole picture.

first, thank you so much for posting the factums of the agc and respondents. it's always very refreshing when there is some substance to back up legal discussions that are normally way over the heads of the media in this country.

second, there is some irony in the agc's factum. part of its appeal is that this is properly the subject of a class action and that the complainants to the hrt(c) do not have standing as representatives. 

it then says that one of the consequences is the part you've cited here - that individuals captured by this complaint are prejudiced by, amongst other things, having this issue heard in a venue with a maximum cap on money awards. 

so, the agc says that it is improper for the organisations to make claims on behalf of individuals outside of certification of representative status in a class proceedings. however, the agc is making representations on behalf (in theory) of potential claimants and their rights at law without blinking an eye. 

i am sure survivors are *so* relieved that the agc is here to protect them from the big, bad indigenous rights groups securing tens of thousands of dollars in compensation per person.

&gt;the result was mind-numbing amounts of waste. last year,¬†the fraser institute estimated¬†that $1.6 billion in cesb funds was allocated to students between the ages of 18-24 ‚Äúliving in families with more than $100,000 in household income.‚Äù that amounts to over half of the program‚Äôs¬†final cost of $2.9 billion.

$100,000 for household income can be considered middle class, especially if two parents are working. if a couple makes $60,000 each, that is still $120,000 in gross household income. hardly, \"wealthy\" or \"priveleged\" households as the article seems to suggest.

&gt;why was over a billion dollars given to students living at home with relatively well-off families? their expenses were minimal and likely could have been handled by their parents.

apart from the my previous point, it's because sometimes parents cut their children off? /s full disclosure, i took the cesb and my parents make over $100,000 - but it was necessary since i still have bills to pay that my parents won't. it's the same reason i work every summer in between university. people who think that everyone's familial situation is the same or that their parents will just dish out money for whatever their children want are naive. it is one of my main criticisms of osap too since it assumes parents are willing to pay for your education and so is more restrictive to children who come from higher income households.",liberals

and, if the government thinks that the chrt overstepped its mandate, *it is right to do so*.

even if the chrt issued a morally correct decision, if that decision is based on an error of law the government, in my opinion, is duty-bound to challenge it.  to do otherwise is to denigrate the rule of law.  the rule of law requires that policy ultimately flow from an act of parliament and therefore from the people; when tribunals exceed their legal mandate they are acting without that connection.

again, this operates in a strictly legal sense, not a moral one.  it's _also_ quite possible for the government to challenge this decision while simultaneously putting forward legislation to enact a similar outcome.  that would be a proper use of democracy, for moral ends.

fixating on \"the government should drop the appeal because we like the outcome! is also anti-democratic on another level: it excuses the government for not using its real levers of policy to fix problems like the above.",liberals

at a time where we cant even decrease them at all it seems.  it would cost billions annually to carbon capture that amount of emissions.  the social costs of carbon is pegged at $50usd a tonne.  that means this pipeline will have a social cost of about $1.5 billion annually, as long as it doesn't have a leak or a tanker crash. 

to balance out this cost the pipeline will have to make an additional $1.5 billion in income after paying all expenses just to break even.  given that \"tripling\" capacity would logically increase profit by a factor of three that means it makes $87 million annually,  while costing us $1.5 billion + the original $17 billion to pay it off.  profitability of this pipeline has to increase by almost 20 times.  that is never going to happen, the south sea's company value only increased by 7.8 times.

i just have zero faith in his (and his cabinet's) ability to execute on almost anything. and on the things he executes on, i have almost zero faith in his ability to achieve desired outcomes.

he's also right to challenge this (which makes a frequent appearance on reddit as a reason for canada to do nothing):

&gt;opponents of climate action point out that canada represents just 1.6 per cent of all emissions. 

if the world decides that carbon is important, canada can't afford to snub its nose at that like the us or china could. we depend on exports and foreign investment, and if the other party in those relationships is carbon-conscious then our economy will just enter into a slow-drip decline if we don't take it seriously, not to mention the loss of whatever political capital we have left on the global political stage.

and that's why they're never going to win.

o'toole betrayed his base with outright on:

- the carbon levy is the carbon tax with different words (and will be much less effective). he legitimately promised people he wouldn't put a price on carbon.

- the gun flip-flop was huge, another single-voter issue for his base.

- many people have finally clued in that the cpc isn't anti-immigrant at all, and realized there's only one party that speaks to their single-issue as well.

- vaccine passports were supposed to be a no-go. once again, this is a massive single-issue voter file.

the problem with the right-wing base is that they have been fed a steady diet of things to make them outraged so that they absolutely despise some topics. there's so many single-issue voters out there who want to do one of the following:

- get rid of the carbon tax

- have all the guns

- not be \"oppressed due to covid\"

- no more immigrants

of course, but my point is that it really ought to be about the voting public. the green party and ndp would benefit under pr (although greens seem to have slipped so low now that they'd probably lose their own seats if there's any sort of cut off at 5%), and that's why they promote and insist on it (which frankly just makes it as much of a 'power grab' as ranked ballot systems).

&gt;i also fear that a pure alternative vote/instant runoff voting system would never pass a referendum since the attack ads would basically write themselves. at the end of the day, the liberals would need to prove that it wouldn't disproportionally help them, and that wouldn't be an easy job, especially to the general public.

personally, i don't think any referendum would pass. they never have, and i severely doubt they ever will. worse, such a referendum would be asking the lpc to spend political capital on a system that they don't care for, which means there's likely going to be little to no positive energy for it. the unfortunate truth is that if we want electoral reform, it's probably going to involve a party having the political mandate from a fptp election and making the changes directly.",liberals

that's true. the manufacturer is taking a combat rifle they developed for the military and selling it to ranchers. it's marketing. when they sell it to criminals or the police, they market it as the  combat rifle it actually is. when they market it to sports shooters, they market it as a toy. it' still the same combat rifle they developed as a versatile killing tool for the military decades ago. 

the fact that they even market it as a combat rifle and toy to the public says more about the toxic  nature of gun culture in north america  than anything. what used to be restricted weapons for the military are now being sold to just anyone in the public. more and more deadly weopons are fnding there way onto the legal market, so more and more find their way on to the illegal market. this needs to be curtailed.  

the gun lovers could do them a big, big favor by policing themselves. they should tell the manufacturers to stop making videos showing criminals how to use it as a combat rifle. thta's dangerous in the world of mass shooters.

you're projectnig here. it's a bald faced lie to say the ar-15 and r14 were not developed as combat rifles. any look at the history of these weapons will show that. military power is being put into the hands of the public. hunters did fine without semi-automatic weapons for hundreds of years without using military weapons.

 it's your extreme emotional attachment to your gun that's bringing you and others here and swarming this site  with trolls, multiple accounts, and bots. everytime an article on gun contril comes out, the thread explodes far more than it should given the relative unimportance of the issue. after all, we're just talking about a priveledge here. like horses, guns are really just an expensive hobby, no one really relies on them for food or a livelihood anymore. they are a big toy. if  they are banned it's really no more important than banning lawn darts or horses from our streets.",conservatives

personally as a very new gun owner, i'm all for o'toole's approach here. i don't think we need full auto guns at all in canada, the 70s ban should stay in place, but the may 2020 oic was a reactionary joke that wouldn't have even stoped the shooting it was in reaction to. we need smart regulations not to just arbitrarily ban guns that look like they are more dangerous",conservatives

 under canada‚Äôs parliamentary system, the basic function of the opposition is to oppose the government on a day-to-day basis. in this context, the opposition takes on an adversarial role, criticizing government legislation and actions, as well as providing the public with alternative policies and proposals. in some cases, the opposition may even try to bring down the government by voting against government proposals, such as the annual budget. 

the official opposition also maintains a \"shadow cabinet\" to critique the actions of the cabinet ministers.

and you should know that the prime minister is not and has never been elected by the people. they have no more legitimacy to speak on any subject matter than anyone else does in parliament, except that a majority of the votes happened to agree with them on being pm but the commons can limit or modify that confidence in any way it pleases, and can issue a ruling on a matter on anything more specific if it feels like it just like all boards of directors of associations are inferior to a general meeting of their members or shareholders and the membership or shareholders can issue prescriptions or prohibitions to its executive if it wants to keep some or all of them for itself. it can keep both trudeau and suggest not holding a snap election if it feels like it.

holding a new election comes with massive costs. elections canada said that the 2019 election costed over 500 million dollars. why spend it on that much money just to satisfy one man, just to satisfy an old convention that derives from zero laws or constitutional clauses when so many mps of such variety of political opinions agree to dispense with an election in a year like this? it also makes it much harder for parties themselves to be internally democratic, like holding fair nomination contests with appropriate interest from their membership, so as to minimize the influence of party leadership in these grassroots activities. it opens up the possibility of corruption and pandering to powerful economic and social interests above ordinary people when more money has to be spent on campaign and donations must be solicited. it means that a huge amount of hours, given by thousands of dedicated people on bills and resolutions, committee reports, and attempts to get information for the people to see, has to start over again, making it far less efficient to legislate, especially when you know one man can pull the plug so easily when it is inconvenient to him. why throw it away for his vanity? it would be a political statement and political interference for a governor general to blindly rubber stamp an election like this that interferes with life so much and the work of so many, to be a mere toy of the prime minister to wield like a marionette puppet as he wishes, pretending to be happy about him.

people have an arbitrarily hard time punishing politicians they don¬¥t want with the ballot box because of the electoral system itself creating self-enforcing effects that diminish this power, making it much harder for people to vote for someone they actually want which is the only binding vote you have. you know well how the spoiler effect works in a plurality system, and it denies the right of a majority of people to make a choice in that a person without that majority can win 100% of the representation that one riding can provide. this is not the equal representation we are supposed to have in the charter.

if we should make the prime minister¬¥s advice be so binding, why not establish the office by law and by the constitution and define its functions? the house of commons is established by the constitution and has its functions laid out there. 

and your condescending attitude towards people suggesting a change is not helping your own ideas. imagine if the governor general did decide to side with singh and the other opposition leaders. would you condescend to trudeau that he doesn¬¥t get everything that he wants?",liberals

that's not a reason dude.  parliament has a mechanism to remove trudeau from power if they no longer have confidence in his ability to exercise the authority of his office - including asking for dissolution.  refusing to use that mechanism means that while they may disagree with his decision, they respect his authority to make it.

the gg should listen to the pm over parliament because parliament has no role in this decision, and vesting the authority to make that kind of judgement call in a single, unelected person is far more dangerous than the potential for a majority government - something canada has had for much of its history and done fairly well by.  trudeau is not asking to be crowned emperor, he's requesting an election.  whatever problems our system has the people have had no issue tossing out pm's they disapprove of before, they won't have an issue doing so this time.

your \"solution\" isn't even an actual solution to any of the issues you claim to have, considering all it does is push off the next election until a later date, when trudeau or someone else would once again have the chance to win a majority.  but now with the added benefit of a rogue gg committing to exercising their reserve powers at will.

and again, this all neglects the much more likely possibility that trudeau, upon having his advice to the gg rejected, follows convention and resigns, almost certainly triggering an election anyway (followed swiftly by the dismissal of the novice gg by the monarch and the appointment of someone who actually understands the job).

but, at the time, there were many articles saying the the liberals were as, or more, progressive than the ndp. and moreover, this was essentially the strategy of mulcair's campaign. while trudeau ran around promising everything to everyone, mulcair put forward a measured, balanced-budget, achievable platform led by a seasoned politician. this is effectively the exact strategy that the bc and ab ndp pursue, and you are advocating that the federal ndp pursue. but as the saying goes, if people are given he choice between two liberal parties, they will choose the real one.

mulcair was not a bad politcian and the ndp is not a bad party. his poll numbers were fine, he stood his own in debates. he lost that campaign on his strategic decisions. i'd prefer not to repeat those mistakes.

singh faces a different reality and i'm skeptical that mulcair or notley or horgan would deliver substantially different results. the problems are structural, not personal. for the time being, the ndp is playing for the balance of power, and if there is a criticism i have, it's that they don't lean into that nearly enough. focus on a much narrower slice of winnable ridings, don't worry about the median voter.",liberals
