hpmc4hg,2021-12-22T07:37:03.000-08:00,"opinion | canada has strict gun laws. why is trudeau trying to soften enforcement? the focus on mandatory minimums is a bit stupid, i don't think there is much reason to believe they are really helpful, even if they may feel right.

but as a general look at canadian regulations on firearms, we are way way heavier on the actual restrictions than we are on any meaningful enforcement or follow through action.

 a good example is that you have to provide references(including spousal, doctor, etc depending) when applying for a gun license, but many people report having gotten their license without their references actually being contacted. it is up to the rcmp's discretion, but providing the budget to actually follow through on existing regulations like that would have a much larger effect than adding more regulations on top that also probably wont be enforced.

especially when some of the new requirements (like in c71) will vastly increase the firearms department's workload, you can expect more stuff to fall between the cracks.
________________

the fact that new regulations and bans are even being brought up as a response to the nova scotia shooting is simply absurd, it had nothing to do with the legal firearms ownership system in canada, and the new rules wouldn't have made a difference either. the fact that he wasn't stopped earlier or prevented entirely is also a lack of enforcement problem, not any lack of relevant laws to enforce.",liberals

**share of population living in the 3 biggest cities**

country | top 3 cities | % of population
---|---|----
canada | toronto, montréal, vancouver | 36%
france | paris, lyon, marseille | 25%
uk | london, manchester, birmingham | 22%
germany | frankfurt, berlin, stuttgart | 21%
usa | new york, los angeles, chicago | 12%

second, we have a major region (with one-quarter of the population) which speaks a different language and has a different cultural identity than the rest of the country. this makes it harder for a party running on nationalism or heritage to get support, because which heritage people want to conserve changes from place to place.

the uk has scotland which rarely votes tory, but the scots at least mostly speak english and the population is small enough that the uk tories can win without getting any seats there. the closest european analogue to quebec would be catalonia in spain, and guess what - the centre-left party also dominates politics in spain. or you can look at belgium, which is pretty much always governed by centrist coalitions - even when the prime minister is from a conservative party, the coalition will usually include social democrats or greens or something like that.",conservatives

this is easy: yes.  the time has come to make it a requirement that jps be lawyers, and have criminal law experience.

  
right now, they're not required to be lawyers.  this is a holdover from a previous era where the jp was a part time role that was given to a well known individual in the town, say a high school principle, knew who the good guys and the bad guys in the shire were.  those days are gone, and bail is increasingly procedurally complicated.    


the current arrangement is ripe for abuse, especially when you have a government that wants to put more people in jail and doesn't care about the charter - as shown by how easily they resort to the nwc.  you can't trust these people, hence why it needs to be a written requirement that the jp be a lawyer.  give them an inch, they'll take a mile.

* gun maintenance, repair, and tuning. most competition guns are a bit more finicky and need to be kept in good condition to be reliable
* if i have to go to a competition in another city, i don't want to drive an hour to my range just to get my gun, then turn around and start driving to the other range.

not to mention, my range (like most good ranges) is out in the middle of nowhere. if criminals can get their hands on front end loaders and other equipment just to bust in to jewelry stores or to pull the atms out of banks, they'd be super motivated to bust in to a range where there's central storage and drive away with hundreds of guns. police response time to a range like mine would be 30 minutes at least.

&gt;rumble inc., a toronto-based youtube challenger that has recently become a destination for right-wing content creators, has raised an  undisclosed sum from prominent american conservative investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;the investment was led by narya capital, a cincinnati-based venture capital firm co-founded by hillbilly elegy  author j.d. vance, who has been preparing to seek the republican  nomination for a u.s. senate seat in ohio after reportedly receiving  counsel from former u.s. president donald trump.   
&gt;  
&gt;mr. vance and narya co-founder colin greenspon used to work for silicon  valley billionaire peter thiel’s mithril capital. mr. thiel, a leading  conservative, is also investing in rumble, as is dallas-based darren  blanton, a former adviser to mr. trump, through his family’s colt   
ventures.

...

&gt;rumble, which launched in 2013, has long positioned itself as a  friendlier alternative for small content creators than youtube. it saw a  spike in popularity after prominent u.s. conservatives, including radio  host dan bongino, encouraged followers to use it instead of mainstream  social media giants such as facebook, youtube and twitter after they   
tightened up on allowed content during last fall’s u.s. election and  following the storming of the u.s. capitol in january.   
&gt;  
&gt;the journal recently reported conservative investors were looking to  fund rumble to set up social media alternatives to mainstream giants  they believe restrict free speech, as the tech giants come under  increasing scrutiny for their control over digital channels that reach   
deep into the everyday lives of billions of citizens globally.  
&gt;

whenever i bring up his history with the equalization formula, conservatives love to bring up how he would have had to vote for the party line (rather than in the interest of his constituents) because the votes are whipped. this is normally when i bring up the free vote on abortion, and they usually turn to ad hominem attacks or try to change the topic.

so either the cpc (as o'toole would like us to believe) will not reopen discussion and debate into abortion rights, lgbtq+ rights, and other things like that, or they are \"free to vote\"

if o'toole wants us to believe that his strong \"moderate\" leadership can guide the party to a more progressive future, he needs to show voters that he has the strength and power to whip his party into follow his vision. this is why the issue of unvaccinated mps is an o'toole problem. he either has the force of will and power to bring his mps into line, or he doesn't.  if he doesn't, his leadership (and the cpc) are doomed to second or third place in future elections.",conservatives

&gt; ahead of their re-election last month, canada’s liberals pledged $78 billion in new spending over five years, about four per cent of gross domestic product, partially offset by $25.5 billion in new tax revenues over the same period, mostly targeting tax evasion, wealthy individuals, big banks and insurers.

&gt; the idea is to tap those who best weathered the pandemic to pay for new spending on everything from mental healthcare to school lunch programs. but those taxes won’t help pay down canada’s record $1 trillion national debt, nor will they be sufficient to balance the budget.

the premise of the argument is that the liberals’ new “tax the rich” strategy is meant to support new spending, rather than pay down existing debt. the concern is that if the debt isn’t dealt with, our fiscal flexibility going forward may be hamstrung. so rather than increasing revenue to buy new goodies for voters, the government should make sure that any increased revenues (whether through new taxes or otherwise) first go towards paying for the things we bought but haven’t yet paid for.",liberals

that being said child care is getting to the point that it is almost out of reach for the average canadian. i don't think taxing the shit out of the nation is a rational way to ago about fixing that problem, i don't think that throwing money at it is a way to fix any problem. but, there is an issue with childcare. it's price point is getting higher and higher, and realistically on the average canadian family income it is starting to become unsustainable.  
and really, i don't know how the issue can be solved. 
but, i do know that it is a problem, and is a symptom of a larger one. it is becoming ever harder for canadain's to continue having a middle class. for the majority of people if you are not born into wealth it is becoming and increasingly uphill battle to become financially stable. 
if you claw back government that allow people to 1) better themselves, 2) then get educated, 3) then actually obtain a well paying job, (something trades or otherwise that would allow them to save some a small amount of money, so they aren't living paycheck to paycheck and completely fucked when anything external happens. all while buying a house, vehicle, and food and being able to then raise a family.) their needs to be clear paths from turning yourself from someone with nothing to a skilled hard-working person in the middle class. i am not saying it needs to be easy, but it does need to be achievable. and, if trade schools continue to rise their prices and go down the same road as universities, well the future will be educated in why they are unemployable.
canadians are in a spot right now where we really decide do we want a country dependent on the state or a state that depends on canadians.but, yeah i do not know if the throwing tax money at child care will help everything, but i could be one way to curb the ever looming shrink of the canadian middle class.

when people say \"racialized\" in the way that people refer to \"over-policing racialized communities\", it's talking about certain demographics, but the term treats the collective experience of non-european canadians as monolithic. east asians, southeast asians, and indians (people from india) have very different interests and issues.

in the end, i would say people most likely aren't going to be offended by the term (it's not quite over-euphemizing like how people with disabilities feel condescended to to when someone tries to use a term like \"differently abled\"). but it's a term that hasn't really been questioned in academic discourse, and i don't think anyone knows whether if the people it's attempting to politely refer to actually prefer the term, or if the issues with the term that have been pointed out in this thread are widespread and unspoken (and not brought up out of respect).",conservatives

not really.

the bq went from maybe 29-30% to 32-33% with kurl's question. they were doing fine before the english debate. in fact, blanchet was deemed the winner of the first french debate and tied with trudeau for the second.

the theory that the bq was on the brink of failure and that kurl's question was their lifeline is disproved by literally all polls taken before and after the english debate.

i would wager $100 the bq would have ended with the same seat count even if kurl hadn't asked the question on bill 21 and bill 96.

edit: i've read many commenters reiterating the same lie on reddit over the last couple of weeks: that somehow the bq's campaign was shaky and was \"resuscitated\" by kurl's question. tellingly, those people usually don't live in québec.

no one in québec believes that the bq was headed towards electoral disaster. on the contrary, it was obvious after blanchet's performance during the first debate that the bq would do well on election night. all kurl's question did was cement the bq's electoral success.

if those people had bothered to look at even one poll during the electoral campaign, they would have seen that the bq pretty much hovered around 30% during the whole electoral campaign - they only got a tiny 2-3% surge after the english debate - wow, talk about a game-changer!

anyone who promotes this garbage theory is  \"telling me they know nothing about québec's politics without telling me they know nothing about québec.\" and i suspect they like it because it reinforces their prejudiced views against \"separatists\" and \"francophones\".

the liberals have to be careful just focusing attacks on ford because the ndp is the opposition party which is traditionally viewed as the ‘government in waiting’. i know the ndp has a lot going against them so that might not be true this time around but the liberals aren’t in the position to be assumed to be the alternative. if they just tear down ford they could risk helping the ndp. similar to what happened in 2018 when the pcs had zero plans and just focused on attacking wynne. then people were like ‘wait… the liberals are bad so why don’t why just elect the ndp’ and then the pcs had the spend the last few weeks of the campaign improving their image and contrast themselves to the ndp.

improving del duca’s image who is mostly unknown could be beneficial to capturing the 60-70% of the province who don’t like ford. it’s a battle between the ndp and liberals to show who is the best replacement. if one of them does a good enough job they’ll have enough to overtake the pcs. if not then they’ll split the vote and we get 4 more years of ford.",liberals

i think you make a generally salient point, but this is a significant misrepresentation and minimization of that situation and why people thought it was inappropriate. there's a lot of context. trudeau himself said it was wrong and people need to stop defending and minimizing this. it was an extremely bad choice and had negative impacts on the government's credibility on reconciliation and even further hurt and damaged the pm and the government's relationship with indigenous peoples.

even if you think what he did was not \"wrong\", the impact from a public perception perspective was extremely damaging and at the end of the day the impact is what matters and the impact was bad. the pm and the people around him should have realized that him doing that (after his schedule listed him as being in private meetings in ottawa, in the context of not going to events he was invited to on that day, and with him and his government already having poor credibility on the file, etc.) would be damaging to themselves and to reconciliation as a whole.

there was only one quote from someone else mentioning it was a long time. the rest of it is speculation as to why he chose to not go back to work. 

but as mentioned it is factual that after calling a fairly useless election and wasting all that time he has now chosen to waste another 5 weeks before going back to work. it is also factual that he himself has not offered any reason for this. so it's pretty fair to comment on those facts and have an opinion about them.

and we are not even getting into the fact that these public loans that are being taken out are generating a return on investment. if the public sector can't borrow at 0.25%, 0.5% and grow the economy by at least that much, then that's an argument that no public sector organization can provide any value in any situation whatsoever.",liberals

&gt;the appearance of the omicron variant, coupled with o’toole’s leadership troubles, has exposed deep fault lines within the tories’ tenuous coalition. there are different cliques of mps: those opposed to lockdowns, those upset with o’toole’s reversal on carbon pricing, those upset with his hands-off approach to bill 21, those upset over the rush to pass c-4, those who support c-4, those angry over sen. denise batters’s expulsion from caucus, those upset by what they see as the public hanging of alberta mp shannon stubbs.

forget splintering back into reform and pcs, it looks like the cpc is currently on the verge of splitting into 7

on the stubbs story:

&gt;the star spoke to several conservative mps and other party sources, granting them anonymity to discuss internal party matters.  
&gt;  
&gt;every mp i spoke to believes o’toole’s office leaked the information itself to send a message to other dissidents.

o'toole really isn't holding back any punches

&gt;some in caucus think o’toole’s main preoccupation is fighting to keep his job.  
&gt;  
&gt;perhaps his non-interference stance on bill 21 can help him secure the support of quebec delegates for his leadership review and help him survive.

what a weaselly move on the part of o'toole, this even makes the other party leaders' spinless stands look herculean efforts",conservatives

sure, but there are tons of factors that influenced their outcomes. however, interventionism, as with covid and spanish flu seems to have been way more effective than the non-interventionalism of the black plague and aida.

this is already untrue. i was unmasked in public spaces both home in alberta and over the pond. hell, until omicron most people were unmasked most place and things were more or less humming. now it's really bad and bringing masks back is really important but once we either all catch omicron or cases start to go down due to masking and restrictions/intervention and we get boosters and the medications in flow, we'll probably start to ease up again.

hard to say  

if we're considering a total breakdown of cpc support in québec, then those votes will go ppc in beauce and will mainly go towards the plc in the other cpc ridings around quebec city.  

québécois cpc voters are already leaning federalism + non-nationalism which fits the plc much more than the bq. we only have to look at the voting history of those ridings to get the idea since their first/second choice was either the ndp or the lpc in 2011 and 2015. the bq is polling at a stable ~20% there with very little room for growth.  

the bq would have to make an historical breakthrough à la 1993 to even have a shot.

&gt; he needs the support of his very nationalsit quebec caucus 

i don't think he has harper's savviness that would allow him to win with only 5 seats in quebec. i feel like he's positioning himself as to pick up some seats around montreal. to do that, he'll indeed need to present a more socially liberal position or, at least, reign in the social conservatives hard. this won't be an easy fight considering that all the federal conservative breakthroughs in quebec were once in a lifetime events (duplessis + diefenbaker, le beau risque)",conservatives

it's not tying someone down and physically injecting them, but it's still coercion, which is a form of force.

other countries are at the point of literally making it a criminal offense to not be vaccinated. ie. prison sentences and/or heavy fines for not being vaccinated.

&gt;  
&gt;the money sent to workers (as defined as working 333 hours (roughly 2 months) a year at minimum wage) doesn't count because it wasn't sent to everyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;that seams like a pretty big goalpost move right there.

there would only be a goalpost move if my position was something like \"leftism is when you spend a lot of money\". i've been very clear from the beginning that how money is spent and sitributed and on what is far ore important. i'm not sure one could construct a better summation of neoliberal ideology then \"let's give billions to corporations no strings attached but make the working class jump through hoops to get it and tell people who we don't view as productive enough to go fuck themselves.\" 

&gt;the government buys the only liquids pipeline between alberta and the pacific coast...that is the definition of nationalizing that industry.

you really need to review your definitions lol. saying a government buying a pipeline is nationalizing an industry is like claiming if a government owns a building it's nationalized the real estate industry. trudeau bought a pipeline because the private fossil fuel corporations wanted the government to do so in order to boost their profits. public investment to boost private profits is textbook neoliberalism, and does not come remotely close to nationalizing an industry. 

&gt;provinces reject money from the feds all the time. look at how many provinces made a big fuss before signing on to $10/day child care...heck ontario still hasn't taken the money yet.

negotiating a potential deal is not at all the same as rejecting money. not one province has rejected the canada health act funds. ontario is trying to spend less of its own money and have the feds cover more, that's very different than just having a plan in place that says \"if a province does x, they get y money\" - this type of plan has never been rejected by provinces. 

&gt;it would probably be easier to just admit you don't like him and don't want to give him credit for anything then argue he doesn't spend money progressively.

are you being being deliberately obtuse? the ppc ran candidates in nearly every riding - 95%+ of them. that requires some degree of support besides bernier himself. they ran 315/338. liberterian party ran 25/338 - what kind of a joke of a comparison is that?

&gt; you mean the green party that's in the middle of complete de-cohesion and is tearing itself apart? the party everyone's looking at like a complete joke? 

very recently - yes - they've been contestants and had impacts in the past.

&gt; yeah - not the ruler i'd use. when lizzie was at her peak she was still somewhat comical but she put seats on the board and at least won her own riding. she'd get 7 percent of the vote or better (or at least be polling that high aggregate). the aggregate for the ppc is about 2.5. you can't really even call it a party at this point. we'll see what happens.

yeah we will see what happens - there's certainly a reason why the cpc sicked kinsella on a smear campaign of bernier and the ppc - as they were worried about them stealing votes from them.

&gt; quite the opposite. they will push the cpc closer to the center to pick up any lost vote. there's lots of room there with trudeau leaning to the left like that. so - if anything the ppc will help reduce conservatism in the canadian political landscape. oh the irony. 

yeah the cpc aren't going to out liberal the liberals. trying to push further left is going to be a losing game for them - they can try to become liberal lite but why not just vote for the liberals at that point.

&gt; bernier is no different that the libertarian party. they show up at election time long enough to beg for enough money to keep going and syphon off a few votes. they run a full slate or close to and have (or did, don't know what their current status is) for many elections. but they never achieved a damn thing.

i don't think the liberterian party has come close to running a full slate of candiadates in all the years they've been in operation in canada - bernier ran essentially a full slate last go around within a year and a half or so of an election - that's pretty good. you can downplay that - but it is an accomplishment - i'm thinking with the cpc pushing further left the ppc will have their niche and will stick around.",liberals

they give us numbers and the simple math on it is 5 in a million is in fact 25% more frequent than 4 in a million.  extremely rare but not something experts can just dismiss.

could you elaborate on that? i quickly skimmed the text of the statute and didn't see anything that seemed to apply to governors general or the powers of the crown. checked the balfour declaration of 1926 as well and all it says about the gg is that they would no longer be the representative of the british government.

i don't understand how the redefinition of the gg as personal representative of the crown, as opposed to representative of his/her majesty's government in britain changes whether they can refuse the advice of the pm to dissolve parliament.

also, obviously this is a different situation to the gg randomly saying no to a dissolution over a year into the term, and lieutenant governors don't necessarily operate under the *exact* same conventions as the gg, but bc saw a request for dissolution denied in 2017. clark requested fresh elections after she failed to pass her first speech from the throne  after the election and the lg refused and invited horgan to form government.

for what it's worth, the brits had an explicitly laid out [convention](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lascelles_principles) on when the monarch could refuse dissolution (until 2011 when they removed the ability of the pm to request elections willy nilly) and the when wasn't \"never\".",liberals

no party had won a majority of seats. the incumbent liberals won 43 and the ndp won 41. 44 were needed for a majority.

the ndp and greens arranged a supply-and-confidence agreement. the combined seats of the ndp and greens gave them a majority position in the legislature.

as is her right as incumbent, clark decided to seek the confidence of the legislature. she lost the vote on throne speech and then advised the lieutenant governor to dissolve the legislature (despite publicly saying earlier that she would let the opposition seek the legislature's confidence). the lieutenant governor ignored clark's advice and let weaver try.

regardless of how well it worked out for arthur meighen (poorly) or weaver (arguably pretty well), there doesn't seem to be a precedent to defer to the pm/premiere in these cases.

i would agree, though, that it would be unusual and precedent breaking to allow the opposition to seek the house's confidence this long after an election. for meighen the delay was a bit more than eight months since the election and for weaver it was about two months. i think we're about 19 months since the last election at this point.",liberals
