honestly, the only way it works out that way is if covid goes away and things get back to normal very, very quickly.  voters here have short memories, but covid is giving a lot of people strong memories that won't fade quickly.

the typical conservative lifecycle in alberta involves doing the unpopular stuff (think education and health cuts) in years 1 and 2, softening up in year 3, then outright bribing voters (think infrastructure projects in key ridings, funding announcements that appeal to key demographics, etc) begins in year 4, after the re-election the cycle repeats.  i know i'm grossly oversimplifying, but in broad strokes this is roughly how it plays out.

covid is throwing a real wrench into that lifecycle.  we're now about a year and a half away from the next election - kenney should be softening up and getting ready to start bribing voters.  unfortunately, dealing with covid requires tough decisions that will anger his base, but a conservative shouldn't anger the base during the softening up and bribery years of the lifecycle because they might remember and not vote (or worse, vote for a different conservative party).

of course, i give myself better-than-even odds of being completely wrong.  kenney may be doing everything wrong when it comes to governing, but he's a master at winning elections.  if anybody can manage a win after these polling numbers it's kenney.",conservatives

if we adopt more decentralized energy storage along with ev's, the power grids can already handle the full adoption of electric vehicles, 

the critical thing most people miss is that the mass adoption of evs also comes with the drastic drop in energy storage prices.

stationary batteries deployed at large destination charging locations can drastically offset grid loads during peak times. 

off-peak charging done at homes and businesses can already be handled by grids, now or with minor updates.

power production overall needs to increase drastically, but the grid is not woefully unequipped for the coming ev boom if we deploy batteries along with charging stations.

the cost difference in energy between peak and off-peak has been proven to pay for the batteries in some places place already. canada has relatively cheap electricity and energy prices so the economic incentive isn't quite here yet, but as demand rises and storage prices fall we will adopt storage quickly.

add in the fact that solar and wind energy prices are falling faster than even the most optimistic estimates from a few years. the cost difference between on-peak and off-peak will just get bigger as these low-cost but variable power sources come online.

the mass adoption of ev's will feed the adoption of stationary battery storage which will enable the wider adoption of solar and wind. at current prices, these technologies are prime adoption.",liberals

the result is that alberta got a pitiful share of resource rent during the bitumen booms - a very large share of the value of each barrel went to private capital. because the resource is so capital intensive, this meant that a very small share of the resource value went to either labor or taxpayers. it looked like a good deal because in a record high price environment with constantly rising production, absolute value of income, employment, tax revenue, etc. grew. but this financial illusion required constantly increasing production to keep the whole show humming along, at the same time that climate change made it obvious that the province would need to maximize long term revenue before winding down the industry.

this was, simply put, extremely stupid and short sighted. it created a situation where the province had to essentially rubber stamp as much new production as possible to keep wages high, jobs growing, and government coffers full, without any serious consideration of long term demand, north american refinery capacity, or future climate policy. and, unlike a country like norway, when the price crashed (and in a raw resource economy, the price always crashes eventually), the province had nothing to show for it. it had stopped making payments into the heritage fund, it had no savings, its workers had gained only a pittance of the value of the resource. it was extremely poor financial planning, and as far as i can tell it was largely ideologically driven.

alberta gave the resource away for free and broke every rule of sensible financial planning for a resource export economy. and now they are truly screwed, and the only thing the conservatives can do is wind people up about us foundations or leo dicaprio or whatever the dog and pony show is this week, and hope no one comes to their senses and blames them for the mess they created. it's an absolute catastrophe.",conservatives

hedlill,2021-09-26T04:34:15.000-07:00,"opinion: is this the end of majority governments in canada – or the beginning? paywalled article so i can't respond to the \"or just the beginning\" claims but i would say the advent of the bloc québécois is what killed the majority government in canada, or at least made it the exception rather than the rule.

since the creation of the bloc we've had 5 majorities:

- 1993
- 1997
- 2000
- 2011
- 2015

'93,'97, and 2000 had the right divided between the pcs and reform/alliance  which allowed the liberals to sweep ontario and most of the atlantic, as well as pick up a smattering seats by coming up the pc/reform split. with that advantage losing half of their seats in québec wasn't that big of a deal.

2011 saw not only a collapsed bloc but a collapsed liberal party as well. admittedly the latter was more important to the cpc getting their majority than the former as it allowed them to make substantive gains in the gta and greater vancouver. 

in 2015 you still had a weakened bloc and a concerted \"anyone but conservative\" movement led the grits to sweep the atlantic and pick up seats in western metros.

the problem the bloc presents is that when a party that has zero intention of forming government can take half the seats in the country's second most populous province, it becomes nigh impossible to make up for that unless one of the other parties collapses.

as the liberals solidify their hold on fortress torontograd, the opportunities for a tory majority become fewer and further in between. likewise, as the bloc block any potential liberal gains in québec then the only real options they have are to try to sweep the atlantic again or hope the extra seats calgary, edmonton, and the other western metros will get in redistricting will make them more friendly to liberal gains. the ndp, of course, is the ndp. 

basically, if the \"big 4\" all show up with their pants on then there really isn't really an opportunity for anything other than a minority. majorities now are more predicated on somebody else screwing up than doing anything right yourself.",liberals

this is not true of the turban. clear difference in that regard.

i'm saying what makes one symbol acceptable is the acceptability of what it stands for, and we do not accept political advocacy during work hours. therefore symbols of political advocacy should be frowned upon in the workplace, but even that shouldn't be a hard rule, better left to cultural norms. 

again, a sikhs turban, or a kippah, or a hijab, are not that. they are not political advocacy. it's clearly different but you're trying very hard to conflate the two types of things. you want reality to match your convictions. 

there is similarity no doubt. both a turban and swastika are worn because of the values of the wearer. but that is not the relevant part. values shouldn't be banned, inappropriate political advocacy should be. 

if a woman teacher wants to shave her head and donate her hair to cancer patients due to her personal/religious convictions, she should not be banned from teaching while her baldness shows. her baldness is not political advocacy. she should not be forced into conformity any more than a turban wearing sikh.

but this was universally renounced by indigenous people. it actually contributed to the rise of indigenous activism (the red wave) which resulted in the formation of many indigenous organizations across the country. prior to this there was very few, and this was still a period when the bands had very little control over their programs and resources. the funny thing is that chretien and that white paper (which was under a papa trudeau government) is probably the closest thing in the 20th century to an 'indigenous awakening'.

i used to be on an ndp eda, yet i left to join the liberal party. i am the perfect example of someone who they need to win back. if they can't win back someone who is a progressive activist that voted for guy caron in the ndp leadership race, who can they win?

i deeply want the ndp to be a successful party. i think it would be good for the country to have the ndp as a strong opposition. they just waste their time on the most pointless shit. 

that is without even mentioning some of the blatant anti-semitism that was further down the prioritization in this section. abolishing the internationally recognized definition of anti-semitism doesn't hurt israel, it hurts jews. amnesty for someone accused of bombing a synagogue (yes, this was a real policy that didn't make it to a vote because time ran out), is not a good look for the party. 

i think the israel policy is fundamentally flawed for a variety of reasons, but it is a symptom of how the ndp base seems to not want to be successful. i mean, just look at the resolutions passed at the liberal convention compared to the ndp and tell me which ones look more appealing. https://2021.liberal.ca/policy/",liberals

- the switch from the more western canadian roots with a broad socialism brush, to one that often only focused on the urban subset.

- the \"he pushed me incident\" in the house of commons.

- a non definitive answer on bill 20 in the 2019 election.

- stating the 2019 election was \"amazing\" after losing half their caucus. aka the ndp \"everything is great\" when the house is burning down in flames.

- jagmeet whole image. he's a well educated lawyer in tailored suits, and flashed them extensively in a magnize when he became party leader. it's polished, and every picture just reeks of posing, often with expensive props. layton had roots in socialism which were more apparent, but also more charisma: while jagmeet just comes across as.. fake.

- the general \"hey it's my idea and the liberals/greens stole it\" . as long as the idea is good and goes forward, that's what i care about. just because you thought about it, doesn't mean it's your exclusive right to it.

and that's kind of where the federal ndp stops for me. they have policies i like, but they just aren't genuine. i grew up in rural sask and the ndp i knew and supported was based off of collective principals. they are there, but there not flashy. it's subtle socialism.

 jagmeet is just, brash and not genuine. its harder and harder to support a party who is more flash then action, and then is constantly suprised they don't get more support. he's not the face of centre left policies in this country that we need. as someone who is centre left, it is difficult to vote for them each and every time since 2011. i'm stuck with the libs; and i'm a miserable voter.",liberals

no offence intended, but this statement is kind of a misunderstanding of energy production policy at it's core. 

to simplify the needs of a society (in terms of electricity), you need 2 things: 

1. available power generation. that is, the availability to flip a switch and have additional power available during peak periods as needed (wind, tidal, solar, hydro, and even fossil fuel). this is something that you can't necessarily control the output from due to environmental, supply, or literally just it being nighttime. wind, solar, tidal, etc, are not reliable constant sources of power. they just aren't. 

2. available \"base load\" (as it's called). this is what the power grid of a society/area requires as a baseline. as in, anything lower, and things start to fail or die. *this* is where nuclear power is so incredibly important. because nuclear power is completely separated from the environmental, supply, or daylight factors that all other current sources of renewable energy require to operate. this also supplements as a sort of 'battery' when needed, because the power is always there. some countries use lake-based hydroelectric 'batteries' (uk), but we don't have that luxury in most of our nation due to, well, flatness. 

tldr: nuclear (and possibly hydro in some areas) power should be what everything relies on, with wind, solar, tidal, etc, being the boosters to the system. 

this is also aside from the technological advances that could be made in the field (canada is already arguably a leader in the nuclear energy field with our reactor designs, as well as the rapidly progressing modular reactor tech), but also for spaceflight (which we don't do ourselves, but which is a sellable technology). also, modern nuclear reactors produce minimal waste compared to the past, and we're already discovering ways to re-use waste for further energy production. and even after it's depleted, we have something literally called the \"great canadian shield\" to burrow into and safely store any waste without environmental issues (a la yucca in the usa). 

_______________

it's basically a massive benefit to the nation, relies on already established canadian industry, and would provide cleaner power sources than any other options. but hey fuck it. because nukes are bad, m'kay! 

that's why i won't vote for the greens till they change their ass-backwards policy towards nuclear power. *they are the ones who have based policy on a buzzword.* if they actually followed the science they claim they do, they'd be championing nuclear power. but they don't, because they apparently view it as a wedge issue they can toy with. i don't respect that, and frankly, nor should any voter. frankly, i'd like the liberals, ndp, dpc, etc, hell even the goddamn bloq start pining for nuclear power. we need it, but no one wants to admit it.",liberals

inflation like we're experiencing is what happens when you dump hundreds of billions in unearned dollars into an economy, especially when there's other inflationary pressures at play. that's why canada (and the us who did the same thing under biden. lets go brandon) have significantly higher inflation rates than many other countries. even for things that we produce ourselves! 

trudeau keeps making the problems worse constantly. get rid of him an the healing can begin. as long as he's in power this will keep getting worse, until we hit  a hard recession an the economy collapses consierably to the point where people can't afford to pay for anything anymore. then inflation gets a little better as the rich buy everything up and the middle class and poor starve. 

the very people the left say they want to 'help' with all this spending are the very people who will suffer the most in the long run. but as long as you get to virtue signal today and pretend you're doing the right thing when you're not.... what the hell, it's all worth it right?",liberals

we need to heat our homes through the winter without burning any fossil fuels and it needs to happen very soon, by infrastructure construction standards. our greatest demand for energy will be when the sun shines least, months before peak spring hydro flows. there is no viable grid-scale, seasonal energy storage option, let’s be real. we need nuclear power in canada or we will suffer from terrible drop in economic productivity. nuclear works, it’s here and we can even “invent” new capacity by just not turning off pickering. 

people say we don’t need nuclear, we have “heat pumps”. unfortunately no. heat pumps don’t work through the ontario winter. i have an oversized cold-weather heat pump and it just will not heat my smallish, tightly-insulated built-in-2019 passive home through the coldest part of winter on its own. it runs forever and gives you just a tiny amount of heat.  i’m right on lake ontario not up north at all. 

even if we could build heat pumps we can‘t install new windows and reinsulate every house in time. we aren’t even building new houses to tight enough standards. we’re still expanding the home natural gas network.
