it should have been obvious even to a child that the bare minimum that a party executive would expect from a leader is to support her own caucus.

the obvious thing to do would be to anticipate this bare minimum requirement and come out with a full throated statement of support for the (now two) mp's in the caucus, to meet with them directly in a well-publicised \"doing politics differently\" -esque conference and otherwise make a big show of disproving the central claim of atwin's complaint. we all know the refrain. \"we're learning, we're growing\" etc. etc. you can get some protection and recoup some political capital from that, and use it as an opportunity to define your image with the canadian public as a hard-working, sympathetic figure.

instead, paul waited to be told what the bare minimum of her job is by her party executive in the form of an ultimatum. 

now, even if she follows through and releases a statement saying she supports her own caucus, it will have been done grudgingly under threat and will ooze insincerity and self-interest.

if he were advising the french public about the maginot line between the world wars, he'd have said that the party that wanted to only build it along the german border had the most effective plan, and that any party that wanted to extend it along the belgian border was \"insincere\".",liberals

i really doubt the cpc is that far ahead in projected seats that can be reasonably marked down via the aggregators when the spread is still +/-30 for each party. 

there was another aggregator that excluded too close to call seats from the seat projections based on regional aggregates today, and it noted a little over 90 too close to call seats.

to my mind that means there's no way to know. 

and even if the lpc do slide a bit in seat count, the ndp seem to have been picking up seats compared to 2019, so it's somewhat of a wash when you think about vote efficiency.

we might end up with a weaker lpc minority, a stronger ndp in third and the cpc making some small gains with the bloc losing ground in qc.

in that scenario the lpc might get to form government if they have just enough seats with the ndp to support them if they try. or if they have just a couple seats less of the cpc they might joe clark them. let them try to manage for a year or so, confidence vote them down after the pandemic (or if the mismanaged any fifth wave or whatever)  and then do the return to government. 

whether that's led by trudeau or someone else is anyone's guess but there are a lot of possibilities. and if the ekos regionals hold, it may actually be a sort of hung parliament situation where no one can credibly hold power because you'll have two parties in the 130ish seat weak minority range.",liberals

my take based on polling of secondary choices for the greens and ndp being 5%, that the eco-socialist wing has already collapsed and thrown their weight behind the ndp. there is only the tories on bikes left in the party.

they had a window from 2019. they had the ipcc report. they had the highest level of funding and the most grassroots they had ever had and its all completely been shattered by, frankly, an issue which should have been *tertiary* at best to the gpc, and an awful leader is paul. the party may well be wounded more then it can possibly recover within a decade.

this government has routinely just failed to be good at the core competency of efficiently running a huge bureaucracy. they routinely appear checked out on issues that they have not themselves put into the agenda.

take covid. as late as a few days before the nba/nhl shutdowns really signalled the start of lockdowns here, we had the health minister out telling the media the risk to canada was extremely low. experts at that time were trying to sound the alarm.

of course, part of the government's unpreparedness may have been caused by the multi-month delay in forming a new government after the 2019 election. for whatever reason, trudeau and the brain trust decided the best approach to a minority parliament was just to do nothing, appoint no ministers, issue no mandate letters, and take forever to introduce a throne speech.

gvy1dm6,2021-04-26T02:23:23.000-07:00,"question period — période de questions — april 26, 2021 a 2013 poll from [yougov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2013/01/08/understanding-how-marginal-taxes-work-its-all-part) found that misunderstanding of marginal tax rates is shockingly high. respondents were asked:

&gt;“suppose that your income put you at the very top of the 28% tax  bracket and you earned one more dollar such that you were now in the 33%  tax bracket.”

and then asked how much more tax they would pay. [fully half](https://i.imgur.com/8rixkhs.png) of them answered it wrong. the poll in american, but i think we can be confident that canadians are little better (if there are any canadian polls, would be very interested).

this incredibly widespread confusion about marginal tax rates must have significant effects on our politics. it seems likely that people are substantially overestimating how much tax they actually pay and even more so, it makes political debates about tax rates severely distorted.

the more subtle implication of marginal rates can be even more difficult to grasp. this naturally makes me think of the 2015 liberal campaign, which featured a tax cut for the \"middle class\". specifically, they promised to (and did) lower the tax rate for income between $44,701 and $89,401. roughly speaking that's the 60% to 90%, which is an interesting definition of 'middle class', but fair enough. **however**, that's the marginal rate on income between that range, when we look at who actually benefits the answer is [shocking](https://i.imgur.com/r2equar.png). in fact, a cut in the 'middle' marginal rate primarily benefits people who earn more than $90,000 (the top 10% of earners). this wasn't a tax cut for the middle class, it was a tax cut for high-earning professionals!

so the question is why did the liberals do this? one theory is that they were just trying to hand a tax cut to their base of high-income professionals and sell it as 'middle class'. but perhaps a more disturbing possibility is that the *liberals themselves* were confused about this. the average liberal mp may well have believed that they were passing a tax cut for the middle class and probably doesn't really look at actual income tables. furthermore, since marginal rates are so widely misunderstood in the population, one can imagine that it would be very difficult to even campaign on a true 'middle class' tax cut promise. the liberals, perhaps realizing their 2015 mistake, spent 2019 campaigning on an increase of the basic exemption which was far [better targeted](https://monitormag.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/updated-mctc-deciles-2.jpg) towards the middle class, but even so, delivered disproportionate benefits to high earners. indeed, the marginal tax rate paradigm makes it virtually impossible to target tax cuts to lower earners without benefitting the rich. one would need to include tax increases in the higher brackets, which generate opposition. moreover, given the widespread confusion, many that actually benefit from cuts to the lower brackets probably think they don't.

so hopefully that this is a persuasive case that misunderstanding of tax rates is pervasive and that it has serious implications for politics.

my question is: **why on earth do we do this?** it would be trivial to present tax rates as *average rates*, rather than marginal rates (which could still be listed for the curious). public understanding and democratic discourse would be vastly improved and it wouldn't cost a dime. has any government ever considered this?",liberals

the pcs have bled a lot of support from red tories, business types, and suburbanites to the libs. the child care benefit was a massive win for them in this regard.

i agree with all your points but a lot of what you said doesn't push the needle. most canadians remember harper and just shrug and say \"well his party is better than the alternative (tories by default)\". the electoral reform issue is a great example of this: tons of people online up in arms at this betrayal, but ultimately an issue only relevant to people who vote 3rd parties that voted lpc in 2015.

the cpc could win this back but are falling into bloc alberta territory. the big tent they built in the early 2000s is being stretched thin - most of their former supporters are cool with lgbtq issues, believe in climate change, and are turned off by some of the bad rhetoric and behaviour during the harper years.

i've seen this issue with a lot of my friends. i have a close friend who is an out and proud socialist, but he voted lpc in 2020 because he lives in a competitive riding. the ndp are far behind so he votes to block the cpc. wouldn't be surprised if many others do the same.",liberals

these conversations are very hard to have here, and they would also have been a lot easier without the pressure coming from the rest of canada using it to single out québec as 'the worst' every single time. it absolutely blocks conversations, because you can't rationally differenciate it from just plain francophobia attack, which have historically tried to make a bridge between québec desire to protect their culture and language from assimilation, and racism (see, bill 101).

&gt;maybe the cbc should attempt to provide unbiased broadcasting, and that includes not launching slapp suits to silence political opponents they don't like?

the case you mention was absolutely not a “slapp suit to silence political opponents they don't like”. “slapp” refers to [“strategic lawsuit against public participation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation). as per the wiki, in a typical slapp, the plaintiff does not normally expect to win, and engages in tactics such as forum shopping and spurious or bad-faith claims. none of that was present in this case. [here is the full decision.](https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/496993/index.do) in it, justice phelan states that it was entirely reasonable for the cbc to bring the lawsuit:

&gt;\\[55\\] the cbc, as a state owned enterprise, is being reasonable in its concern to neither be nor appear to be politically partisan. it is unfair to allege, as the \\[conservative party does\\], that the adverse impacts arise from its commencing this litigation. there is no evidence to support the accusation that cbc is acting irrationally in protecting its rights. to do otherwise is to open it to a catch 22 situation of being accused of favouring a party if it did not exert its rights against them and criticized as partisan when it does assert its rights.

if the court felt that this was a slapp lawsuit, it was entirely open to it to say so, and/or to strike pleadings or dismiss the case on summary judgment. it did none of those things. on the contrary, the court said the suit was a reasonable one to bring.

&gt;posting a clip of andrew scheer speaking at the leadership debates in 2019

another blatant misrepresentation. the federal court decision lists five cbc clips and four tweets. the five clips include clips of andrew coyne, john paul tasker, and rex murphy, all of whom were a cbc employee, a cbc freelance commentator, or a regular cbc panelist. the cbc’s concerns were clear: the conservative party of canada was not presenting andrew scheer’s comments as his own, but was utilizing cbc’s brand and associated personalities to make it seem like the cbc was or could have been making statements that the cpc itself was making. and while the court ultimate found those to be fair dealing, again, it recognized the cbc’s concerns as being reasonable ones.

i also found this part of the decision interesting:

&gt;\\[17\\] the political parties agreed not to edit the leaders’ debate themselves, but rather to use only the full-length video or the 63 cbc-approved clips from the debate available from the cdpp youtube channel (cdpp clips).

so the cpc agreed to that and then broke its word? and you think it’s the cbc that comes out looking bad in all of this?",conservatives

also:

&gt; **trudeau entered the 2015 campaign having made a lot of “transformative” promises**, he said, in part because the liberals wrote their more ambitious pledges while they were a third-place party.

&gt; **in contrast, harper made a lot of “transactional” promises**, which petry described as those targeted at sub-populations like parents, for instance.

harper's minor little promises would therefore be easy to do. and some of his major promises like reducing the gst were actually bad policy that even right-wing analysts said was bad for the economy.

plus, the liberals had been in power for less than 4 years up to that point, and then covid happened not long after the last election, which caused the world to go haywire.

there are some excellent candidates for emission reduction if that's an actual concern (carbon taxes don't reduce emissions significantly unless they're so high they seriously damage the economy).  remember that transportation and power generation represents something close to 40 percent of our emissions. so that's where you'd likely start, but there's lots of choices. they would include (but not be limited to)

funding nuclear power to replace coal and oil plants in canada - will also help canadian companies sell abroad. that can make a massive difference.the new micro cluster reactors are unbelievably safe and clean. 

putting real resources into ev's and infrastructure (and possibly funding some of the battery development going on in canada, hoping for quantum battery systems!! :) ) 

massive tree planting campaign and, y'know,  actually planting trees not just saying you will like justin. bc for example has had almost a quarter of it's wood trashed by pine beetles, cleaning up all that deadwood (which is currently releasing all it's carbon into the air as it decomposes) and planting new trees would consume an absolute craptonne of carbon. helps with youth employment as well - tree planting is a traditional job for university students and the like over the summer. a moderately mature tree can store about 133 lbs of carbon each year (depending on the size and age, it can be much more) so if you actually planted a million trees you'd be taking 133 million lbs of carbon out of the atmosphere every year. there are forestry companies who would chip in towards that. 

here's a popular one right now - give tax breaks and or other incentives to businesses to keep as much of their workforce working from home as possible. that's a hell of a lot of cars that don't have to be on the road driving to work every day - a hell of a lot. that makes a huge difference - from the globe and mail:

light-duty vehicles (read: cars) produce more than four times the ghg emissions of all domestic aviation, according to canada’s 2019 national greenhouse gas inventory.

if you include light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks – so, cars, pickups, suvs and smaller vans – they account for nearly half of all ghg emissions from the transportation category

so - if you pull even a quarter of the cars off the road weekdays, and you're pushing to change the remainder to ev's and electric delivery trucks and such then you would exceed our paris climate change commitment right there. there's also less traffic so less idling, you're making it easier to live in the suburbs or small towns so you're easing the cost of buying a home for many,  and you don't need to build as much road way infrastructure.

though the best gun control bill would be one that says anyone who has had any history of domestic violence of any kind even unconvicted, towards children or spouses etc. (because they often don't ever get convicted or even charged) should have a lifetime ban on guns. a large chunk of gun related violence is done by people who have it in them to commit domestic violence. usually not with black market guns either lmfao.",conservatives

if the cpc or any of the federal parties want a good federal strategy on housing, it would be better to:

* eliminate federal mortgage subsidization programs and programs targeted at boosting home ownership and idolizing sfhs.
* provide more direct assistance to lower income individuals and households to make housing more accessible towards them (good options for this would be things like a guaranteed/basic income scheme, housing choice vouchers or  housing/rental tax credits  for low income people/households etc.)
* a federal land value tax. it would translate to more density &amp; less sprawl, boost housing supply and encourage a wider variety of homes to be built. a federal lvt would also be a very effective revenue tool and could replace or lower several other taxes. for example, a federal lvt that collected the equivalent of 3-5% of the total value of land in canada (around $4.2 trillion in 2017, probably somewhere above $4.3 trillion now) would generate around $129-215 billion annually for the federal government.

so we need government intervention in order to provide more affordable housing. the government should build housing and rent it out at reasonable below market rates. to be blunt, your need to profit from a stock is not an essential human right, but access to affordable and stable housing is.

and to note, it's a zoning and lands problem as well, but the free market on its own will not solve the affordability crisis in housing. both our history of housing and housing in other countries shows this. government intervention and provision of housing is necessary for the housing market to not completely leave behind working people. the government previously built and provided housing right up until the 90s, and having some degree of government provided housing is the norm in comparable developed countries. and we do have government provided housing here in canada, just not nearly enough of it to match demand — in alberta alone we have literally thousands of people on the waitlists for subsidized housing and rental subsidies.",liberals

limits to sfhs is absurd. people want houses, and grew up in houses. self-evidently, building more and limiting purchases on the behalf of corporations and foreign entities would cool the rate of prices. this race to the bottom of coercing people to do away with home ownership doesn't address the problem. those at the mercy of rent-seekers are seeing rapidly rising rents as well. if the answer is \"build more\", then build more houses. 

obviously, we're not for lack of space. if the concern is for land-encroachment, we should remind ourselves that perpetually increasing the population level in itself is bad for the environment. we all have an environmental footprint. we all use electricity, infrastructure, transportation, buy gadgets, and want a nice place to live. everyone consumes. lack of sustainability lies with scaling population, not consumer choices, at the heart of it. notwithstanding the short-run structural shift required to renewables, which primarily requires an effort on behalf of the financial and private sectors to change electrical, manufacturing and transportation pipelines.",liberals

this pretty much explains it if you go to the 2008 elections tab. basically, the pc premier of newfoundland started a feud with harper over equalization payments. 

basically, the premier danny williams wanted to have their cake and eat it too: while newfoundland was a have-not province for the longest time, they started to engage in offshore oil drilling which brought in a lot of revenue for the province. they wanted to keep both equalization and oil revenue, which would have required a change to the formula.

the paul martin government agreed to this demand under the atlantic accord, but it was extremely unpopular in the rest of canada. ontario went against the liberals as a result. then, during the 2006 election, stephen harper sent a letter to williams saying he would remove non-renewable natural resource revenue from the equalization calculation.

after the election however, harper broke his promise (kinda). while the 2007 budget did meet this promise by introducing the option of a new equalization formula allowing each province to exclude its natural resources, it imposed a cap on the amount of equalization each province could receive, effectively negating the accord. 

the budget also gave each province the option of retaining the original equalization formula, meaning that no province would lose revenue due to the new formula. however, williams thought this new formula still shafted newfoundland and he began the abc campaign.

on top of that, newfoundland has historically been a have-not province (meaning they rely on welfare from the feds) and atlantic canadians have always been more red tory than blue. hopefully that adequately explains everything.",liberals

more importantly though, home ownership is high risk and has a lot of hidden costs. i've seen people have their condo fees shoot way up because the elevator broke in their building, if an appliance breaks that can be $1000s in additional expenses. you have to replace the roof on a house every so often. changes in property taxes.

i didn't read it that way, but that might be what they meant. i think the liberals are concerned about losing seats to the ndp, and housing would be a major reason why. halifax is a good example of that. that doesn't mean they will get wiped out, if people like their housing platform (which they should), they won't bleed that many votes as most of the people that don't trust them to implement it wouldn't have voted for them anyway.",liberals

factually they have kept less than 40% of their promises from 2015 onwards, and effectively none of their campaign defining promises, with the notable exception of marijuana legalization.  
  
their problem is that the lpc promises the moon... and the sun, the  stars, some of the planets, various asteroids, etc. but only manage to come up with some of the smaller, less well known asteroids, and none of the big ticket items.  
  
with a track record of failing on vast majority their major promises, making a bold and grandiose promise like \"no foreign ownership\" just rings completely hollow. *especially* coming after the other parties announced their platforms. it looks more like one-ups-man-ship than a real policy. if this was part of their platform... why not release the platform day one, or release it with the rest of the platform in september as they stated they would?

denying any citizen from living and working in any province of their choosing would indeed be a violation of charter rights... but those rights do not actually give anyone a right to own property. in fact, property rights were specifically excluded from the charter rights and only still apply as a bill of rights...which does not carry the same standing or protections in canada.

they do have the right to enjoyment of property, if they own it, and not be denied enjoyment of property they own.
but, even that right must adhere to fundamental justice and not restrict other rights or other's rights.

so, the state taking away their current property would indeed be scary, but denying anyone in the future from purchasing multiple properties not for their personal enjoyment would not actually violate any freedoms. 

there are still lots of other options including changing how multi-home owners are taxed. secondary homes could be taxed as a business if a rental (since generating income) but some would argue it raises rent. except, it would lower interest and margins of landlords and more would exit and less enter that landlord market and would skew rent/mortgage balance in favour to owning own home.

the difference though is that i still don't think that means that people who can't afford 20,000 a year for 3-4 years shouldn't be allowed to have kids, as the guy i was replying to said. 

instead, i'm saying that 20,000 a year isn't easy or practical for the average or median canadian, and so government has a role to help people. investing in childcare, whether that's subsidies or directly creating public spots, has a net benefit for society as a whole (and ideologically, since women often end up having to stay home with children, there's also a gendered impact to not getting involved).",liberals

and here is the thing, you pretend there is another option: no, there wasn't.  this was a thought that hadn't entered any minds at the time; if it did, this was so rare and in-between that you could laugh it off; it would never have any form of public support; it was not only not thought of, but it would never be viable even if it had been.  we are not living in a nice world; 200 years earlier, starving kids were executed for stealing bread, for stealing bread, chop of their head!  this was a brutal time, full of war, death, destruction; it was not a time of love one another as you love yourself.  to that world, this was a radical policy, and most countries would not pursue it; they would laugh it off, asking why they would ever help any conquered natives.

&amp;#x200b;

to put in in perspective, what you say, that the good-slave owner and bad-slave owner, well, why don't i tell you what most liberals have told me about modern examples.

example: an environmentalist knows that buying food from such and such store, and it has a lot of plastic packing; they don't like this, but buy it anyways; they do try to buy items that have less of an environmental impact, however, but these items still have a massive impact.     at the same time, someone who doesn't believe in any environmentalist stance just buys twice the amount, not caring at all for any impact.  is it clear that it is better to be the environmentalist than the other guy; definitely.  is ti still morally reprehensible, still leading to the destruction of the earth, and known by many at the time to be so; without a doubt.  is there any chance that any process can change if the environmentalist denies the only way to advance in society, and pretty much the only way for them to be able to live well and be able to even think about the environment: without a doubt, yes.

the same thing went for slavery; that only way they could have any political influence was if they had slaves; they knew it was wrong, therefore they would treat them kindly, but if they rejected the slaves, well, someone would just be sadistic to them, and slavery would not be ended as soon as it was.  so your thought is flawed.

why don't we apply this to residential schools:

there is the person who wants the indians to be educated (yes, i use that term for historical reasons here), in the european way, of course, and they want some assimilation to happen, and then there is the person who wants the indian dead, in poverty, or as a slave, etc etc.  is it better to be a residential school person than the other option: yes!  is it morally reprehensible: yes; was it well known at the time: no, no it was not.  

for 3000 years, for as long as the indo--europeans existed, the thought had always been assimilation; indo--europeans assimilated to the culture they conquered to prevent uprisings, but the conquered people always were assimilated to their religion and language.  for all of colonization, and even a bit further back, the european policy was to take what they considered the good aspects of the culture (usually technological progress, but as we see with japan, sometimes bits of culture), and assimilate what they saw as their good bits of the culture on the other group, or of course kill them off.

there was no better way; it hadn't been thought of.  canada is the father of multiculturalism, and that concept has only bee around for as long as pierre trudeau has been prime minister.  before that, it was not a thing.  canadians take that for granted today.  

so no, your argument does not meet; in the era, that was the moral way of doing things; all other options were much worse.",liberals

kill them all;

assimilate them.

assimilation had been a technique for more than 2000 years, first used by the indo--europeans, than by almost every other culture with an empire.

let is not forget that it was pierre trudeau who make multiculturalism a thing in the entire world; it did not exist before that.

people didn't know cultural genocide was a terrible, terrible thing.  and ya know what, the guy who planned this out, who never lived to oversee it, wanted them to live in humane, healthy conditions.

you got to understand that everyone thought that the problem was their culture, and everyone had told him his entire life that their culture was inferior, for that is what all of europe believed, and the settlers as well.  that is what europeans always believed, for 2000, if not 4000 years.  

&amp;#x200b;

he wanted them to live a good life; the only way the government thought it were possible was if they became europeans.  that is not racism, it is just massive arrogance.  racism would be saying that because of their skin, or their race, they can never learn our ways, and even if they did, they are always inferior to us because god made them inferior.  that is real racism; it still goes on in more than half of the world today, by the way; 70%, even.

you can read a bunch of my other comments, because i have already talked about this issue a tonne, and i don't want to spend hours retying it to lots of other people.

but what i am telling you, is that by your standards, 90% of all people living before pierre trudeau was made pm were racist.  that is people all the way back to the roman empire, and long before it as well.  that is every culture to exist on this earth, including the first nations of canada, for they as well assimilated their culture on other conquered tribes.  why don't we tear down almost every monument in canada; every one of them is on the back of racism.  in fact, most of our parliament building as as well.  kill off the queen, in fact, because her family was made through the oppression of other people, off of mass assimilation, not to mention the killing of many women.    
the thing that must be known, is by our standards, the entirety of history is racism, because people are flawed; that is how it is.  why don't we just remove all of history from our sight?  

&amp;#x200b;

the point of celebrating history, of having statues, is to realize that man is and always will be flawed.  we must ask the painter to paint us \"warts and all\"; we need to remember our fallacies, but we also need to remember our chiselled jawlines.  we need to remember the good that was done, and to do the good, yet be reminded that such people that did mass good also did some evil stuff as well, and thus we must strive to be good, but to try and never do evil.

so ya, you are unreasonable; you are taking standards into their lives that did not exist back them, that could have never existed.  you are akin to putting words in their mouths, in fact, that were never spoken.    
you have lost appreciation of all progress that they helped to make; i dare say, without individuals like ryerson, perhaps one of the least racist people of the entire era, we would all be more racist today than ryerson ever was.",liberals

i agree, with you, if a private provider can operate in canada they should be able to operate within the public system. but here's the thing, when governments spend tax payer money they are under scrutiny from the public and it is painfully slow process. if this process wasn't so slow there would be no market for private health care option.

i think that the conservatives *are* seeing a lot cbc content about racism, because people are constantly taking screenshots of anything related to race on the cbc and then sharing it out-of-context with commentary about how the cbc is virtue signalling.  when they think about the cbc, they don't think about shows like schitt's creek or most of their local and national news reporting - their frame of reference is only the screenshots they've seen recently about islamophobia on the rise or a non-profit that gives free clothes to trans clients or indigenous leaders calling for climate change action, and all the mocking comments their group members made about how \"woke\", racist, trying to brainwash the people the cbc is, and they all agree that obviously it should be defunded.

it's based on the policies put forward, as stated in the article.

details from jaccard's full analysis are [here](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/septembe-2021/assessing-climate-sincerity-in-the-canadian-2021-election/).

the highlights of the ndp portion are:

\\- carbon budgeting vs. broad base carbon taxation, the former being the ndp's proposed solution, while having a much larger economic impact for the same emissions reductions as the latter.

\\- the ndp policies not meeting the stated goals, and the necessary increases in policy impact to achieve the ndp's reductions

jaccard states that the policy itself is difficult to model due to lack of fundamental details, but even an extremely charitable interpretation results in highly inefficient emissions reductions relative to other options.

the conclusion:

&gt;an ambitious target combined with economically inefficient policies is devastating to the economy.

in summary, the policy proposals from the ndp would have enormous negative consequences for the livelihoods of canadians, and it is more than likely that they would not follow through with those policies if in power (as seen in bc and alberta ndp governance), therefore their sincerity is exceptionally low.",liberals

now, most of these scandals/issues are minor and wouldn’t sink trudeau on their own, but they add up over time. all it takes is a catalyst (which appears to have been forcing this election) for it all to just be too much and make the voters want change.",liberals

in summary:

* need a business licence to transfer firearms more than 3 times a year (straw purchasing)
* add aggravating factors to sentencing for firearms offenses
* increase enforcement against cross-border firearms smuggling
* repeal bill c-71 and the may 1st oic
* \"conduct a review\" of the firearms act and implement a simplified classification system
   * codifying that system into law (ending rcmp arbitrary decision making)
* defining \"variant\"
* make it so that, if firearms are surrendered to the rcmp, they must be returned if charges are dismissed
* ensuring firearms are not confiscated because of an expired licence",conservatives
