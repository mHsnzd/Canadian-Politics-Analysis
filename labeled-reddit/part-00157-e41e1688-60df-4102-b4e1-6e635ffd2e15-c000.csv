no one is paying over half their income in taxes, don't lie.

what?

&gt;and that i should be taxed more to pay for things i have no benefit from directly?

you're going to benefit more from the current daycare plan than the conservative plan, to say nothing of dental, and pharmacy plans. my kids are going to be out of daycare before the 10/day plan is in full effect, guess what, i'm fine with that, it's going to help more people who need help than the conservatives plan. no one who's making 30k can afford daycare, o'toole's plan is a joke.

haha now i have a bridge to sell you! 

but more seriously, i think it depends on what you think \"fucking insane\" is. between 5-15 years from now we'll likely see the end of trudeau's liberal and a new conservative government. either way, we aren't seeing any major renovations on that front. hopefully i can be wrong here, but i think singh has already reached the ceiling of his political career.


people have been tired of \"the grind\" since prehistory. it's really nothing new, and to be honest, the internet has a way of magnifying something's (un)popularity to disproportionate levels (see: popularity of electoral reform). 

other than wfh becoming more of a norm, which only really affects office workers, i think in the coming years you'll see salaries rise a bit to match rising cost of goods. the latter will be more uniformly applied to workers than the former, but will be slower reaching the bottom earners who's wages are already largely dependent upon legislated minimums.

either way, as salaries seemingly look like they better compete with the american variants, i suspect we'll see a whole lot of nothing in the next 5-15 years. maybe a ubi pilot somewhere in there, if the cpc stays out.",liberals

hepwrav,2021-09-28T23:22:18.000-07:00,"u.s and them — september 29, 2021 &gt; i can sorta understand the idea of having a debt ceiling, to impress on legislators what new spending means to the nations debt load

no, that's what the budget is for.  debt ceilings appear to be an archaic piece of history from the days where each individual bond issue was specifically authorized by a separate bill.

the idea that the debt ceiling is a time to reflect is a modern rationalization for a broken process.

&gt; the fact that the us separates authorising expenditures, and authorising increases in borrowing to pay for those expenditures, is yet another example of how that country seems to be designed to not work.

it's not the separation that's the problem, really.  we here in canada have a [notionally separate debt ceiling](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-freeland-conservatives-spar-over-proposed-new-18-trillion-debt-limit/), but we know it's never an issue because we almost never hear about it.

the problem is that the united states lacks the convention of confidence, so it has no way to resolve internal deadlock.

the fiction of our westminster government is that the queen proposes a governing agenda and parliament authorizes it, granting appropriations or changing the law as necessary.  that fiction separates the agenda from the approval, and when the approval is lacking (i.e. when parliament no longer has confidence in the queen's ministry), then we end up with a new government (with after new elections) to propose a different agenda.

in the united states, however, congress is an inchoate mass tasked with both creating and approving the agenda^(&amp;dagger;).  if (when) it stalls, there's no way to force a change of direction.  the debt ceiling is just one manifestation of this problem with particularly dire consequences; we see the issue even more often with the routine use of emergency (continuation) appropriations and not-irregular shutdowns because congress can't approve a budget.

unfortunately, the political structure of the us emphasizes minority veto points, so the party out of power seems to only gain from making the party in power waste its time, effort, and political capital on having the country not shoot itself in the foot.

i have many core issues with the liberals as how they deem to \"regulate firearms\". much of their information they release or poll to people frames \"assault style weapons of war\" no one can own such a device. much of the bans are due to looks vs actual functionality and this can be directly quoted by members of the liberal party.

the former to police chief whom expressed little concern and openly supports carding citizens is our current safety minister. bill blair, said(while still police chief) vetting gun owners is a waste of time - go after criminals - it's a waste of tax money that could help border/gang units. funny how his tune changes when he's a politician. also in a 2018 tweet trudeau said because of their laws (as it currently stands) you need a license to purchase ammo/guns. this is a lie as we've needed pals for decades.

they want municipalities to determine handgun regulations. leaving a potential litigation nightmare we see in the us where different states/municipalities etc. all have their different views on firearms regulations. yet liberals say the cfo/rcmp has final say on regulation? this is a direct contradiction. municipal leaders know more about firearms than trained cfo/rcmp armories? they've also motioned ideas to have firearms stored at gun ranges or armories? this is baffling as where do we find the money, resources and infrastructure to support this? 26% of the population in canada own some kind of firearm.

i feel like i'm reading fiction when i hear some of these purposed laws.

then i remember it's trudeau and blair who are directing this play.

**buybacks:**

estimated 90,000 ar15 style target rifles in canada (now expensive paper weights).

that's just one of the models they banned others include sg550 green rifle and the vz.58 and so on. also 50cal. rifles (they're 5-6gs retail). so an average rifle of these models (50cal aside) are 1500 - 2000 dollars easily.

i don't meant to be crass but....do the liberals know how to do math?

now they also want to ban airsoft and paintball, so they've buried it in a gun bill aimed at banning \"assault style guns\" again a contradiction as no such firearms are available to legal citizens. *\"ban this thing that's already illegal since the 60s/70s and unobtainable legally - but - frame it as licensed citizens are breaking the law\"*

**other contradictions:**

**liberals:** bill c-22. removing minimum sentences for violent crimes with guns.

**liberals:** voted against, and defeated c-238, a conservative bill to combat illicit smuggling of firearms across the border by criminals.

**liberals:** spend an estimated 1billion plus on just buybacks and not support for gang/smuggling police units.

and i'm sorry, but singling a non-white country out for denouncement for doing the exact thing a bunch of white countries are doing (including what's actually a **milder version** of what the nation leading the charge - amerika - is doing) is racist. like, if someone questioned why a court only ever sent black people to prison for assault when just as many white people showed up there for it, only a racist would jump on them and claim they're condoning assault (and only a racist would say \"well at least it's good that some people are held accountable for assault, so i support that court's actions\"). so fuck right off with that shit, you're being racist right now and somehow don't even see it...except y'all are dming cowards, so clearly you know you're being racist or you'd say this shit in public. 

jesus christ, it's like everyone just had a bee in their fucking bonnets for it to be socially acceptable to hate on asians again.

----

the recent spike is likely due to the canadian government's recent denouncement of china...for something actually very shitty (edit: bear with me, this is relevant, not whataboutism), but also just a milder version of something we've repeatedly refused to denounce america or any western country for doing. and america's version is objectively more severe, since 1 million murders is worse than 1 million kidnappings, and openly stated torture camps (\"black sites\") are worse than \"reeducation\" camps (likely prison camps in reality).

so that means the canadian government just selectively chose who the rules apply to effectively on the basis of race. people learn from that shit, and \"it's only genocide if asians are doing it\" is a pretty fucking racist message, especially when the group being supposedly protected is the exact group the drivers of this motion have repeatedly fought against protecting for decades now (since conservatives consistently block laws against islamophobia). but suddenly they care about muslims if it's asians mistreating them? nobody is fooled by that, which makes the whole thing racist messaging, because selectively enforcing laws (even just laws) against minorities is racist.

and there's a direct correlation between racist messaging from government, and the rate of hate crimes and hate rhetoric against the targeted minority groups. for example, [the rate went up \\~50%](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3102652) after trump was elected largely on the basis of his constant racist statements. i'm guessing that's what's happening here, since the timing matches so closely.

edit: note that i'm aware it was a joint ndp-conservative measure. the ndp's support for it isn't racist, because they're also willing to denounce majority-white countries for similar crimes, and have supported anti-islamophobia laws from day 1. but that's not who's driving this, and while \"china and america are __*both*__ genocidal\" is the ndp's position, it's not the public messaging around this, nor how the conservatives presented it, which makes the whole scenario racist and thus likely a driver of the recent spike in anti-asian hate.",conservatives

according to stats can, in 2018 43% of toronto's homeowners owned multiple homes.¹ so even before the current real estate madness, almost half of people buying houses were investors looking for rent payments. so when housing prices exploded, the big winners were a lot of people who already owned multiple properties. 

the housing crisis is definitely pushing me to the left, but the crazy thing is that neither the liberals or the ndp seem to care. somehow wealth inequality isn't even a subject. so where do you turn if you want the government to do something? 

is it partisanship keeping liberal voters quiet about the housing crisis, or do they really not care? it's just mind boggling that most people can agree the housing bubble is bad for canada, but there's zero political will to do anything about it.

i'm genuinely curious here, did people think pre-government trudeau was a left-wing guy? he always seemed pretty centrist to me. for example:

**pipelines**

justin trudeau speech, [october 2013](https://liberal.ca/liberal-party-canada-leader-justin-trudeaus-speech-calgary-petroleum-club/), supporting a \"social license\" position where canada should do more to reduce emissions and thereby gain the credibility to ask for a pipeline here or there. this is pretty much the actual position of the government after entering office (and of ndper notley as well).

&gt; let me be clear: i support keystone xl because, having examined the facts, and accepting the judgment of the national energy board, i believe it is in the national interest. it will not eliminate all of our economic problems, as its most ardent supporters suggest, nor will it precipitate the end of the world as we know it, as its most vocal opponents contend.

**terrorism**

trudeau, [in the first debate in 2015](https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/tale-of-the-tape-read-a-full-transcript-of-macleans-debate/), explaining why he supported harper's widely-criticized anti-terrorism bill but was also promising to amend parts of it (as opposed to mulcair who wanted to repeal it altogether):

&gt; mr. harper wants everyone to be scared that there are terrorists hiding behind every leaf and rock; mr. mulcair wants us to be scared for our charter and our basic rights and freedoms. the fact is any canadian government needs to do them both together. 

**taxes**

trudeau, in the same debate, taking the usual neoliberal line on corporate taxes being counter-productive, and instead preferring to raise income taxes on high incomes.

&gt; [mulcair's] plan to hike corporate taxes is simply pandering to the people who like to hate corporations, but we need that growth. we need that job creation.

&gt; but you’re right, the money has to come from somewhere if we’re going to invest in strengthening the middle class ... which is asking the wealthiest one percent in this country to pay more tax, so we can give a big tax break to the middle class.

trudeau absolutely deserves every ounce of criticism for doing a u-turn on electoral reform and banishing pharmacare to the back burner. but on the whole, i think his ideological positioning on the campaign trail is pretty close to the actual performance of the government in office.",liberals

the truth we have to face is that there were never really a lot of ideological conservatives in the united states. these intellectual folks may have been able to turn a blind eye to the dog whistles and the crowd reactions all those years, but the warning signs were there. today's gop is largely the cult of trump.

- the cpc caucus doesn't seem to be in any hurry to turf o'toole, even though they have the power to do it any time. 

- the party seems to have taken the hint after january 6th and said \"let's stay away from that\". conservative mps already expelled sloan from their ranks, and o'toole snubbed mps making anti-vax comments/spouting conspiracy theories from his shadow cabinet.

i think we’d also have a solid chance at reclaiming seats in quebec. the reality is quebec was not ready for a sikh leader of the ndp and the contrast between even mulclair and singh shows. granted some of that might be singh’s policies as well, but i think that singh’s ethnicity/religion definitely has not helped he ndp in quebec.",liberals

see below:

\"we have not considered the benefits from zoning which could certainly outweigh these costs. **however, if policy advocates are interested in reducing housing costs, they would do well to start with zoning reform**. building small numbers of subsidized on housing units is likely to have a trivial impact on average housing prices (given any reasonable demand elasticity), even if well targeted towards deserving poor households. however, reducing the implied zoning tax on new construction could well have a massive impact on housing prices.

of course, it may well be that the positive impact of zoning on housing prices is zoning’s strongest appeal. **if we move to a regime with weaker zoning rules, then current homeowners in high cost areas are likely to lose substantially**\\*. to make this politically feasible, it is crucial that any political reform also try to compensate the losers for this change.\"",liberals

it is important to understand how something works if you wish to comment on it. confidence is expressed at an instant in time by the house as a whole. trudeau never lost the confidence of the house, and the electoral prospects of the ndp ensured he was in no danger of losing that confidence.

&gt;it's also super unfair to only allow the opposition to call for an election because they can also use that to their political advantage.

i never said he shouldn't be allowed. he was, is and should be allowed. with some minor constraints in extreme situations, calling an election is the unquestionable prerogative of the pm.

you seem to have forgotten the context of this thread: the commenter to whom i originally replied was arguing that trudeau's government was about to fall regardless of whether he called an election. i was and am pointing out that it is nonsense to argue the government was about to fall. that's it.

i think the much more interesting question is whether it makes sense to go all the way to full legalization. at that point the crime problems go away, but we run up against the fact that some of these drugs are incredibly dangerous and maybe you don't want them sold in pharmacies or at a government-run heroin shop. or maybe you do! maybe that's exactly what we should have.

i think the problem for this thread is exactly that: the policy is relatively uncontroversial among the kinds of voters the ndp are trying to take from the liberals. it's obviously a good idea, so the only way to be nasty about the party you don't support is to make some other, tangential critique of the reporting.",liberals

otools finally seen the light, that the best thing is a the carbon pricing . unfortunately for him , he shacked his cart to the crazies and the cpc has spent years screaming about how carbon pricing would kill canada as we know it.  


i'll give him a tiny bit of credit for seeing the writing on the wall.   


1) its admitting the carbon levy is good and it shows me to he's taking it somewhat serious.  the plan may suck, but i mean he just took the party forward knowing how upset like 50% or more of the voting base would be.   it also signals that perhaps they might listen and be like \" well the lpc carbon tax is decent, we may tweak it alittle but stay on its current schedule\" maybe.  governments love to change things for the sake of changing things, rather then just adopting a good idea.   


the cpc was the only  (series) party to not want the c-tax and he(otoole just said \" fuck it i am going to yeet us forward\"

2) this might be the rallying cry that sees a mass exodus over to ppc aka. vote splitting the right.   
normally i'd love this idea of the vote splitting right, however i do believe we need a strong opposition party to keep the lpc in line, jt has basically got his majority now.

so i need to describe waste a bit. the uranium we use is radioactive when we pull it out of the ground. that's why we use it. the time we have for the spent fuel, where we wait 10,000 years is the time it takes for that fuel to return to that original radioactivity level. after it goes through the moltex reactor that 10,000 years becomes 300-500.  they explain that a bit in the video. as it burns up a lot of the fuel that have longer half lives.

it's very easy to offer people money to vote for you the way trudeau does. it's more complicated to explain to them how conservative policies will benefit the whole country, and thus ordinary people as well. especially when you have a hostile press which only gives you 30 second soundbites to explain yourself. when you add in a leader who isn't a great speaker or particularly charismatic it becomes impossible. he winds up spending his time apologizing for this or that slight or offense rather than explaining policy.  
  
what this party needs is a leader who is going to explain how they're going to grow the economy in very simple and specific terms, and thus create more wealth for everyone. it needs a leader which will make canadians proud again of being canadian. yet this party has avoided anything which even remotely smacks of nationalism for years. nationalism has worked well for the caq in québec. and they are arguably the most left-wing province in canada. it would work well for us to if we had a leader capable of inspiring people.",liberals

they are already working (and, in the vast majority of cases, have completed the process) to provide water.  so absent them developing a magic wand that means construction times become instantaneous, what do you think they should be doing differently?  (and presumably, in that scenario, you'd blame them for not developing the wand fast enough).  

you said we need results, i pointed out that *we have had results*.",liberals

* a constituency association no longer gets 100 points automatically. if it has fewer than 100 votes, they are awarded one point per voter. accordingly, this would dramatically alter the final points as quebec and atlantic canada will see their influence plummet - almost all of their riding associations had less than 100 voters iirc",conservatives

you still haven't answered my question, i don't think i'm the one with partisan blinders here, what do you want the government to do differently?
