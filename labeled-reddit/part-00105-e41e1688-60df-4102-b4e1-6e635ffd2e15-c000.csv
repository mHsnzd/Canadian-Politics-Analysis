that isn't true, and it doesn't work that way in practice. the united states still has the highest numbers of skilled immigrants coming in (per capita, and in overall numbers), and they also have a *very* restrictive policy toward admitting parents/retirees. the world is beating down the door to enter the united states, notwithstanding that the united states does not readily admit \"net tax burdens\" to their country.

it's also pretty clear that each party has things that it cares more about than the environment, so when the environment is up for consideration it tends to get the bare minimum of acknowledgement from each of the parties. 

the libs are happy to make a nod to the environment, so long as it doesn't conflict with their primary priority - currying favor towards the next election. that's why they paid over the odds for a pipeline we should have cancelled.

the conservatives flatly don't care about the environment, as demonstrated handily when o'toole tried to get them to acknowledge climate change.

&gt;we are writing to inform you that the green party of canada and the green party of canada fund have filed an application in the superior court of justice for ontario. the application relates to certain internal proceedings of the federal council and the executive director related to the leader of the party.    
  
we understand that the leader is of the view that the party is bound by certain rules of confidentiality, which we dispute. as such, we will not be providing you with further details regarding the nature of the proceedings at this time. having said that, the application is a public document. if you would like to review it, it can be found in the toronto superior court registry by searching for court file no. cv-21-00665916.

in the relevant court file, it essentially says that the federal council was prevented from pursuing actions like the membership review and confidence vote until the election of a new federal council via arbitration. which certainly tracks with what was speculated about. 

on the one hand, i am fairly certain that this will effectively kill the gpc, or at least revert it to where it was 15 years ago, which is, even in its current state, regrettable. on the other hand, i don't see how the gpc can grow with annamie paul as its leader, considering how, according to b.c. members, at least, [68% of members wanted their federal council representative to vote for no confidence](https://scontent.fyto1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/218746499_10158553584969141_6479837398027151645_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=825194&amp;_nc_ohc=lvt8uf-hmxuax_l1cwm&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fyto1-2.fna&amp;oh=7e7c67812baf84409e92e1d555322b11&amp;oe=60fccffa). i just hope this doesn't end with ms. paul transforming the gpc into her own personal party, which she seems to want to be just the liberals on earth day.",liberals

this is because legislation on matter like this requires evidence and science, which cannot be pulled out of thin air - exactly why no deadline was given. research takes time - funnily enough, the schedule was to have it ready in early 2020 - right when this whole covid-19 thing happened. 

&gt;devine said cbs believes there should be a way to distinguish \"risky sexually-active gay men from not risky sexually-active gay men.

&gt;\"that's the premise that we're operating on for trying to be more inclusive for people who should be eligible to donate blood,\" she said.

&gt;**much of the cbs's current research is focused on how to ensure maximum clarity in the screening process, so that questions are carefully worded and properly understood by prospective donors**.

&gt;\"we have to be able to show that if we stand up a set of questions that are behaviour-based, that they actually get the right information,\" devine said.

&gt;**she said it likely will take cbs until early 2020 to wrap up the research and issue a proposal to government**.

they also made him a star candidate because the media is comprised mostly of mediocre white men who are threatened by chrystia freeland and would prefer to ignore that she exists.

i still remember john ivison getting a nuclear ratio when he pooh-poohed her historic appointment as being another clumsy mistake by trudeau for appointing a mere journalist to handle the nation's finances. jokes and cartoons about her holding the country's \"purse strings\" abounded online and in print. that they reduced her to little more than a fashion blogger fresh out of grad school as they fawned over all of carney's \"eminent qualifications\" is about as blatantly sexist of an insult as anyone could get.

but ever since, they've gone and added insult to injury. they didn't even bother giving much oxygen to the budget, and are continuing to ignore all the childcare announcements. singh's stunt around the gg got more airtime than repeated childcare agreements in the maritimes. granted, the national media in this country ignores the maritimes to begin with, but this seems to be more than that. this was the capstone of freeland's budget and could be the legacy of trudeau's career. but it's a girl thing, so it's not worth their ink and pixels.

beyond the horse race, anyone who genuinely supports the ndp should want them to do better. structurally speaking, they're the green party with more money who've been around awhile longer. a cadre of activists with pet issues who don't really have any actual idea of how to get what they want implemented, or simply don't like the answer and try to find ways around or even through it. failing that, they just get angry and claim that the system is rigged because the inexperienced leaders the \"grassroots\" has put in charge don't actually want to do the hard work.

what jagmeet needs to do instead is to encourage voters to elect ndp governments at the provincial level so that the things they want to see happen, can happen once the federal government secures provincial buy-in. by simply ignoring that and pretending like anyone who points this out is a meanie, a racist, or a stickler for the rule books, the ndp are doing a disservice to themselves, to their supporters and to canadians writ large.

jagmeet is saying pretty words, and the federal ndp aren't behaving like a serious adult party. constructive criticism isn't \"trashing the left\". it's pointing out reality. the liberals understand that, which is why they get things done. the ndp doesn't, so they either copycat the liberals or complain out of *jealousy* that they're not the ones who are getting things done. thus making it more difficult for *anyone* to actually get things done.",liberals

i don't think the ndp serves a purpose at the federal level. not with this iteration of the federal grits anymore anyway. what ought to happen instead is that they either defederalize or only run candidates in places where the liberals have no chance, and pour resources more so into the provincial level so that the necessary intergovernmental partnerships can be realized that would advance progressive causes. he campaigned for horgan but prefers to ignore notley and horwath, instead blaming trudeau for things that are in kenney and ford's purview. gee, makes you wonder if there's something else going on among the ndp backrooms that makes the brass so reluctant to acknowledge them.",liberals

why is the life of the parliament a different amendment to you than protecting canada from arbitrary dissolution? there was no minimum number of sessions or a maximum length of a parliament before the triennial act of the english parliament, but it was taken from the king´s prerogative by mere legislation. it is clear that things that were once fundamental powers of even kings can be restricted by statute. a court would have limited incentive to declare it unconstitutional anyway given their bias towards upholding the will of elected parliaments unless it is blatantly unconstitutional to do so, infringes on the rights of provinces (what do provinces have to do with limiting the power of the governor general to dissolve the parliament? where is their standing to appeal?), or infringes on the rights of citizens. 

a citation from a scholar is useful but binds 0 people. only a court can do that with interpretation. 

i should add that the text of 1982 act says that the parliament makes laws that amend the constitution, the verbatim text saying: subject to sections 41 and 42, parliament may exclusively make laws amending the constitution of canada in relation to the executive government of canada or the senate and house of commons.

that would suggest that they don´t need to be enacted specifically invoking the constitution to amend that constitution, and as the canada elections act is a law, adopting laws such that it modifies an effect of the constitution on a topic that the parliament alone is competent to amend would imply that section 56.1 is constitutional.",liberals

i agree with you here. the issue is that she specifically said she was indigenous and only indigenous people should serve in the position she resigned from. surely there is some proof of her claim to at least meet her own standard?

edit: i'd take literally any band chief or tribe that would come forward and claim her at this point. that this isn't happening is telling.

&gt; of voters who said they were open to voting conservative but ultimately chose not to, the poll found eight per cent were less likely to vote conservative because of the carbon pricing policy. meanwhile, 17 per cent were somewhat more likely to, four per cent were much more likely to, and 44 per cent said it didn’t change their vote.

if anything, i found the carbon plan toothless and pointless. it was a weak policy intended to avoid moving the needle on climate change, but to appear as though there was intent to do so. but it's not the _only reason_ why i chose not to vote tory.

i'm among those who began to have serious doubts when o'toole flipped on firearms. although the grit pundits would have us believe that his firearm flip cost him votes because it drew attention to his pro-firearm position, it cost him _my vote_ because it revealed that he wasn't serious about undoing the oic and depoliticizing firearm classification.

it was the final straw, for me; i already believed he was duplicitous about climate change, and other issues, and firearms were the last major policy of importance to me that attracted my vote to them.

hery8qo,2021-09-29T07:49:57.000-07:00,"conservatives must solve their suburban conundrum ah, see, here's where the fundamental flaws of your position come out. i \\*wasn't\\* comparing the fetus to the corpse, in my analogy the corpse to be respected was the \\*woman\\*, the fact that you missed that adds credence to the idea that pro-lifers dismiss the inherent value of women. and here's the other thing, there is no consensus for when a fetus becomes a human life. none. because it's a fairly arbitrary delineation, this doesn't mean it's not an \\*important\\* distinction, but rather we have to use our better judgement. that's the point of laws that limit when you can get an abortion, unless they're crazy restrictive like those in texas, as it's hard to know you're even pregnant at six weeks.   


and no, it's not a false equivalence, you just value the fetus more than you value the woman bearing it. everyone has a right to bodily autonomy, but the fetus is not conscious, aware, or in many cases recognizably human. pregnancy wreaks all sorts of havoc upon a woman's body, from hormones to fatal complications, to the frankly terrifying prospect of childbirth itself. then there's the awful economy that shackles many young couples into a lifetime of living paycheck to paycheck due to the horrific costs of raising children. or the fact that some people just don't want children and it is absolutely wrong to force a child into a home that doesn't want it.

as for your alternatives:

abstinence - code for \"i want to punish women for having sex\". promoting abstinence is a direct contravention of human nature. people like sex. women like sex. human s have a biological drive to have sex. stopping people from doing so to preserve \\*your\\* comfort is as ignorant as it is selfish.  
adoption - doesn't deal with the bodily autonomy issue. you're still forcing someone who \\*doesn't want a child\\* to bear and birth one for \\*your\\* comfort.   
keep the child - grow up, not everyone views children as a blessing, making someone suffer for nine month in the hope they change their mind is utterly ridiculous.   


and then we get to the climate whataboutism. tell me, when you were growing up and in school, if there was another student being a disruption and general hellion, was their behaviour an excuse in the eyes of your parents? probably not, right? well, our government is beholden to us, and we want to see some action done. the choices of china and india are utterly irrelevant to our actions at home. it's not even a \\*good\\* excuse not to engage with the problem. also, china and india \\*are\\* doing what they can to fight climate change. the problem is that they're very populous countries and the standard of living within them is rapidly advancing to meet western norms. it is not going to work, asking them to cripple themselves before the wealthiest and most powerful nations on earth do their part.

yes that is a fair characterization.  the thing is that doctors can generally define their own role and decide that they are comfortable doing certain things and not others.  and then they just won't do the things they aren't comfortable with whether that is on a clinical comfort or moral belief ground.  so i can definitely find common ground that a doctor shouldn't come to work somewhere that abortion is clearly listed as a clinical role they have to be ok with, take a job there, and then refuse to do it.  but realistically the doctor would most likely just say ahead of time \"i don't want to do that specific thing\" and the employer or group would say \"oh ok we really need people, we will just have other group members do that thing you don't like\"

considering abortion is a non-urgent elective procedure there is basically no scenario where this would actually become an issue.  

there are some kinds of objections that would be much much harder to be compatible with working in medicine - like if you wanted to be an er doc but refused blood transfusions.  then it is an emergent and time limited life saving intervention and you are the doctor who needs to provide immediate stabilization.  you can't really say you are referring that to a colleague.

for example, on the federal level, 91 mps voted against the anti-islamaphobia bill recently; all 91 of these votes came from the cpc and the bq. included in this 91 was mp karen vecchio, someone i have met and genuinely like on a personal level. 

based on my conversations with her and members of her family, i can easily say she is a genuinely decent person and definitely isn’t islamophobic... but it doesn’t matter. 

this is why i can’t support any individual conservatives, because once they get elected, their free-will as an elected official is stripped of them, and they must follow the party line.

note: i know it’s basically the same with all parties, but i don’t have extreme moral issues with some of the other parties.

part a of section i specifies that, as well as it could be religious or idealogical.

e is of part ii. so when e says clauses a-c it is talking about part ii a-c. everything has to follow part i anyways.

e is saying you can't block services unless you're a protest, but that only exempts you from e not the other things. so non-protests aren't exempt from e. 

&gt;so we have a political act that is not a protest/advocacy/dissent? i struggle to think of actions that couldn't be characterized as that that are solely section e and not a-c.

you can't think of any protest that only blocks access to services without causing other harm? how about picket lines or any other blockades or non-violent protests? e is specifically saying those types of non-violent and non-destructive protests are exempt. of course they still have to follow other laws. 

&gt;but...that's basically everything? what political act couldn't be deemed a protest or advocacy?

anything that isn't argued that way by the perpetrators or meets the definitions. if someone blocks access to an essential service because they're protesting the working conditions there it isn't terrorism - that doesn't necessarily make it legal still, just not terrorism. if someone blocks the same service just because they want to, or they hate the family that owns it, or to cause a blow to the country/organization to further the agenda of another country/organization, etc then it is terrorism.

[§2 of the *criminal code*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-1.html#h-115011) further defines a *terrorism offence* as:

&gt; (b) an indictable offence under this or any other act of parliament committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a terrorist group,

those targets were set in 2018.

anyway transport canada's statement last fall that we're not on track for 10% by 2025 seems pretty surprising tbh, they must use extremely conservative modeling...

government projections tend to underestimate the uptake of new energy technologies, but the idea that canada's ev sales will go from 3.5% in 2020 to only 4-6% in 2025 seems totally bizarre.

then, in a completely separate meeting, the members meet again to choose a candidate.  the candidate is not necessarily part of the 20-person board of directors; the candidate can be anyone.

but the two groups (board and candidate) have to work together regardless because the candidate is powerless and penniless until the writ drops.  sometimes that leads to awkward situations of clashing personalities, like this one, where the board (which holds the purse strings) is full of old experienced party veterans and the candidate is relatively new and ambitious.

these are old canadians that can't be cared for adequately in their homes anymore and some died from being abandoned and not getting food, water or their meds.  far too many suffocated to death in part due to inadequate facilities and staff.  it's going to cost to fix this but we need to make it better.

&gt; 10 years ago, the lpc looked like they were going the way of the british liberals 

yeah, that's only what the cpc supporters were wishing.  it wasn't reality then, as the cpc frankly didn't attract many liberal supporters in any of their campaigns.  it's not like there was a rise of another party that took in disaffected liberal voters.   so when they felt confidence in a new leader, they returned to voting.  

 &gt;point is, circumstances can change rapidly in unforeseeable ways.   

yes, it can.  i'm thinking at this point though trudeau would have to be caught diddling little kids, while in blackface, and stealing money from the country in order to see most liberals abandon the party/stay at home, even temporarily like they did during the harper years.   the social conservative movement is just that toxic to most canadians.

as things stand i can't see the cpc appealing to liberal voters very well, although the \"change\" vote tends to benefit one of the two big parties. there are a lot of apolitical centrists who will switch at ease between liberals and tories depending on their approval of the government. we saw this in ontario too, where ford largely won his majority due to \"ford liberals\" in the gta. it wasn't just a vote split, the pc vote and vote share increased dramatically in a lot of flipped seats.

the cpc's best case scenario might actually be a liberal majority because that might convince the base that they need to shut up and accept moderation in order to win. they'll also need to find a leader with an ounce of charisma (maybe ambrose jumps back into politics?) but if the cpc doesn't improve its image in the 2020s, liberal dissatisfaction will likely help the ndp more. we could get a weird scenario where all three major parties are around 30% in the popular vote. who benefits from this kind of split is anyone's guess, but history suggests the cpc will get at least a few points of support from liberal voters, enough to win a minority.",liberals

in many cases results are kept confidential, even from other medical staff (doctors, specialists, etc) and patients. it has been frustrating. my prefecture did not allow me access to my positive covid test which i need to come home. i was lucky that the team of doctors and nurses who helped me in my recovery circumvented the issue by creating an entirely new document for me to use to get back home. even they were denied access to my original test results. 

there have been 2 government sanctioned relief packages. the first was a set of 2 cotton masks per household that were too small. the second was a one time ¥100,000 (~$1100 cad) back in april of 2020. 

furthermore with japan's incredibly high debt to gdp/capita ratio, they could not afford to install nationwide measures, citing their constitution as what limited them from acting federally. in reality, japan thrives on tourism and since covid-19 they have held 2 major travel campaigns during peak months. it's also part of the reason i believe in their push for the olympics. they hope to generate the revenue that most other countries get from tourism in order to pay down a large chunk of their debt. i doubt they'll break even now with their original bid tbh.

i would say that old pandemic has, and anyone who is being honest with themselves would agree. 

the very stark reality is, the pandemic greatly impacted two things. the operation of parliament was changed in a way that benefits the incumbent, hence why the cpc tried to resist it to an extent and the lpc (with weirdly ndp support) fought that. people here complain about things like question period, but like it or lump it, the media loves the pageantry and its just not the same the way it was being done.  eot just did not get a real shot at proving himself in the hoc in the way we are used to. this is not necessarily to say the changes to parliament were bad or ought not to have bern done, but even if it ought to have, it short changes eot to a great deal, especially since he became leader *during* the pandemic.

second, for about a year and a half no one outside of political junkies and pundits paid attention to anything news related that wasn't covid 19 (and to some extent trump, but that would have happened anyway). for the average voter, you see trudeau with daily pressers with a friendly media, along with health authorities and premiers. same thing as above, eot didn't have a fair shot for non-politicos to learn even what he looks like really, let alone his stance on anything.   could they have done better? maybe, but you're kidding yourself if you think this was in any way usual.",liberals

i don't think that i have voted liberal / ndp because i desire change for the sake of change. i think that there are things that could be fixed or improved - rising income inequality (although thankfully not nearly as bad here in canada as in the usa) alarms me; i think that climate change is real and needs to be addressed; i think that our public healthcare system needs to be protected and funded (i am in alberta, where the ucp has recently proposed cutting the pay of nurses, and in the middle of the pandemic broke its contract with doctors). 

i think that conservative politics tend to favour big businesses over citizens. one example: it bothers me that canada has among the most expensive cell service in the developed world, enabled by a complicit crtc and the big three providers colluding to keep prices artificially high. australia has a similar land mass, population spread and geography, and yet their cell service prices are _much_ cheaper than ours. as taxpayers, we subsidized that infrastructure, and now we are paying through the nose to use it.

however, i do not agree with, for instance, the lpc's repeated attempts to restrict responsible gun ownership. i am vehemently against bill c-10, and the way the liberals pushed it through absolutely destroyed any remaining faith i have in trudeau's leadership (plus snc-lavalin, we charity, etc). i am glad the senate declined to pass it for the summer.

the issue isn't the existence of online learning, but the desire and push to save money by making it mandatory.  there is a subset of youth who have thrived in online. but for most youth, the outcomes are abysmal.  teachers lack the resources to teach online and engage most (though not all) students effectively.  there is no classroom oversight because there are few-to-no tools to manage a classroom online.  that's not even accounting for access issues that still exist.  

though some of these factors would be mitigated by returning to mostly-in-person school, it remains true that most teenagers do not do well in a such a self-directed learning environment.  i'm all for offering courses online. but requiring students to take them undermines those who have spent their entire educational lives up to that point in a class environment by shifting the entire way their education works.  considering most, will continue afterwards offline, the online modality just serves as a needless risk when mandatory and offers little in its current form.  i think it's one of the worst choices the ford government has pushed in their entire term.  one among many.",liberals

[one issue is that 68.5% of canadians own one or more homes](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/11f0019m/11f0019m2010325-eng.pdf?st=nx3xxfqa). it's unlikely dramatic legislation will be passed to favor the percent of the 31.5% who don't own but are ready to purchase at the expense of the 68.5% that do own. it may be notable that the current rate of home ownership is at a 60 year high. the higher percent of home owners is one reason why prices have risen.

&gt;a year ago, if someone was planning their life and assumed a house was in their future, now it's a condo. if their plan was a condo, now it's renting forever. meanwhile, existing homeowners gained hundreds of thousands in wealth.

it depends on where, the price inflation is not uniform and 2 major markets spiked much harder. what people may have to plan to do is live a life outside toronto and vancouver. a lot of major cities around the world are driving the same type of choices. living in nyc means either a long train ride or a tiny apartment. same with most major cities and especially san francisco, london, tokyo, beijing etc...

&gt;the federal liberals only begrudgingly included housing in their platform after all other parties made it a priority.

as others have pointed out a million times to you; because the feds are the least able to address it. the majority of the tools the feds have can only make it worse. the tools that could adjust it more are extreme and have profound implications to the economy. things like the first time buyers program directly inflates the price of homes. doing less at this level may be beneficial.

by jurisdiction it is a municipal issue and that jurisdiction is granted by the provinces. one way to fix the lack of supply is to dismantle the consultation process but that would be controversial. as would steam rolling the nimby lobbies but it would be less dramatic than something like eliminating the primary residence tax exemption.

&gt;so what's the endgame here? continuing to gaslight young people will lead to dangerous populism.

one thing you might want to consider; is that you have to adjust your expectations. no good solutions to this will be fast. every fast solution is extremely risky. and based on the pattern of real estate prices, any solution will take 10-30 years not 10-30 months to bring affordability. 

that affordability may also include much reduced square footage of homes. this is because real estate prices are sticky. you won't be able to force prices down. only stagnate them and then it's about how long inflation takes to make them reasonable. even drastic action won't change this. it's in the predictable behavior of sellers, if they would take a loss on a sale or if they are leveraged, they will never sell at reduced prices. you get reduced volume for sale instead.

if you can't accept a fix would take 10-30 years then you're setting yourself up for profound disappointment. there is no magic policy which will re-align prices immediately.",liberals

as for getting nothing in return, to use covid as an example, we've been offered billions by the federal government but kenney has refused most of it, or accepted it and just shoved it deep into his pockets never to be seen again, becasuse it doesn't fit his narrative of the \"federal liberals\" being anti-alberta.",liberals
