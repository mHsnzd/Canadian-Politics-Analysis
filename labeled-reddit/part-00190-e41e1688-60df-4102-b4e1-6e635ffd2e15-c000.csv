it's not a parliamentary committee, and therefore doesn't benefit from parliamentary privilege.

it is an executive panel that can view documents that the executive chooses to give them.

parliamentary privilege requires access to unredacted documents when requested. since it's not a parliamentary committee, there is exactly zero requirement to provide the people on that panel with complete documents or all relevant documents.

for all intents and purposes, it's the same as a dinner party that reads what they're given by the host.

second, parliamentary privilege cannot be circumvented or curtailed without unanimous consent from all parliamentarians. 

the executive cannot tell parliament \"we unilaterally imposed our own panel made up of people we picked that we don't have to show everything to. you're constitutionally guarunteed privilege is now satisfied.\" that's not how that works.

look back to the afghan detainee issue, where stephen harper's government was illegal withholding secret documents from parliament and trudeau was the one voting for motions demanding unredacted documents.

you say that catholics do not wear crosses, and that may be true, but do you think it would be appropriate for an immigration judge to decide to wear a cross? what about a police officer on patrol in jewish neighbourhoods? bill 21 effectively prevents religion from being used for the purpose of intimidation and as a tool to alienate and marginalize minorities.

here, we have a rule that most people can follow without effort, but some people in particular can't without significant personal sacrifice. it just so happens that the people harmed by the law happen to be mostly brown. the point of the law is to require that sacrifice or to prevent the hiring of people who aren't willing to make it.

your understanding of canadian conservatism is a caricature. canadian conservatism has not always stood for minimal-state intervention and neoliberalism. early conservative leaders like macdonald, diefenbaker had a much different view as to the role and responsibilities of the state in relation to private actors.

in fact, you seem to take for granted the chimera that was the merger of both the canadian alliance and progressive conservatives. this ignorance is curious, and i’d advise you to do some much needed research on the recurring formation and dissolution of conservative parties in canada. it was roughly around the 70’s and 80’s when canadian conservatism began more closely resembling american conservatives, particularly in regards to economic policies like cuts to social spending and lower taxes.

many of your positions seem more based upon rhetorical scarecrows of what you think opposing arguments are contending, rather than based on what the models and debates actually are within empirical research. the ban on conversion therapy also has nothing to do with gender-affirming surgeries. 

moderation isn’t necessarily done merely out of charisma. in fact moderation in one’s approach is often about trying to account for the gaps in one’s thinking, though admittedly, some people are just so ignorant that they can’t see the contradictions and assumptions within their own models and views, and therefore fail to think critically.",conservatives

if you're going to start making a numbers argument to get rid of official bilingualism, we're going to just fuck off and leave.  because in practice what that will mean that there is simply no reason for anyone to learn french, and the province will be assimilated into broader anglo-canadian culture.

you may think that if quebec leaves then that's a good thing, but canada's leaders currently disagree (and have historically disagreed) with you.

and why wouldn't it be? ohhhh i get it - you can't refute it so discredit the source. you're a genius, 

&gt;like why do you seek to be so proud and condescending. 

i'm hardly proud. there's no 'pride' to be had being smarter or more educated than you are at this point.  and condescending isn't quite right either - more i have a healthy level of amused contempt - but i'm still hopeful someday you'll actually learn a little bit more. 

&gt; it says ayn rand is a conservative. 

ann rand was a modern conservative for the most part. in the us they try to claim anyone who's not a social conservative isn't a conservative on occasion but that is, of course, insane. she believed in smaller gov't, less gov't interference in personal choice, free markets, all the good stuff. 

which brings us to a point. you seem to feel that every conservative ever born believes exactly the same thing from this list you've got and more importantly anyone who believes anything on that list is a conservative. that is not how it works. people are people. and two people can be conservatives and not believe exactly the same things. they're not robots. 

&gt;conservatism is an ideology. it doesnt matter which country you are in, you are either a conservative or not. 

wow. that is in the running for the stupidest comment so far. lets break that down. 

first off, conservative is a political ideology. it's not a religion. and politics always - always has to have the context of the political world around it. 

so no. not the same everywhere by any stretch. in fact, it's often not the same in two different parts of a country, never mind different countries. 

that was just dumb. of course it requires the context of the political reality in the area. 

second - it is idiotic to say 'you're a conservative or your not'. people are not robots. a person can believe the majority of a thing and still hold different opinions on some issues. that is normal and healthy. being conservative does not mean that you have sworn absolute loyalty to some sort of quasi-religious dogma. it never has. 

sorry jr.  you failed again. conservatism isn't a religion and you can't just announce that there's a checklist like that. i guess that's what you get for getting your education on facebook.",conservatives

hhtl3ek,2021-10-23T13:37:30.000-07:00,"conservatives, just get your shots already &gt; who is unavailable for the vaccine in canada?

children, mostly. i'd also include people with an adverse response to their first dose, and fully vaccinated people who don't get the full benefit of the vaccine because they're immunocompromised or just unlucky. that's millions of people who, unlike the unvaccinated, behaved responsibly. they might not all be at high risk of death, but long covid is horrendous and the long term effects of a childhood infection aren't well understood yet.

it's worth saying at this point, that a virus mutates faster with more hosts, as well. so a large group of unvaccinated hosts makes it more likely that a more deadly or vaccine-resistant strain might emerge, taking us back to square one.

&gt; scientists quoted saying we need at least 70% vaccination to reach herd immunity.

operative words being \"at least\". those estimations were before the delta variant emerged, and bear in mind that they're based on the *total* population, not the *eligible* population. we're barely into the 70s now, and that's only thanks to people conforming to vaccination mandates. i'm not sure where you're getting 80 or 90% from.

&gt; most of the covid deaths were due to comorbidity with another illness

i see a difference between maybe dying of a heart attack in the next few years, and suffering a gasping, lingering death in pain and delerium right away. 

i think you also need to carefully define your terms, there. i'm healthy and young, with a normal life expecy, but if i died of covid tomorrow, you could probably associate it with another (well managed) illness.

&gt; most patients requiring icu care are people with heart disease that require around the clock monitoring and acute care.

i'm not sure we connected on this point. i'm saying that unvaccinated covid patients are filling icus making them unavailable for everyone. 

more broadly, they're making urgent care less accessible for everyone. i've been to the er with a family member in the last few weeks and it was an utter shitshow because of the number of covid patients there. separately, i sprained my ankle and couldn't have it assessed because no walk-in clinic is actually taking walk-ins. the numbers released by healthcare sources suggest that this is happening all over alberta and saskatchewan right now.

&gt; like a transplant will reduce the load in hospitals? i'm not sure. if you could clarify that for me that would be great. 

i understood your point to be that we don't impose consequences on diabetics who contribute to their own illness with a bad lifestyle. i don't think that's true. it just manifests differently because the costs and risks work differently. a prime example is that active alcoholics are generally ineligible for liver transplantation, because it's a terrible use of limited medical resources.

&gt; people cannot participate in social activities such as restaurants, gyms, theaters

doesn't this seem pretty focused to you? people who might transmit a virus are restricted from certain spaces where that sort of thing happens. i see that there might be a bit of coercion there, but that seems to be incidental to the fact that unvaccinated people shouldn't be gathering in large numbers for obvious reasons.

and maybe more to the point, things have gotten bad enough in alberta and saskatchewan that the choice is really between shutdowns for everyone or just the unvaccinated. isn't it more respectful of civil liberties to restrict only the people you have to, and who choose (again for empty principle) to be restricted?",conservatives

if i were the boss of the teen staffer who made this, i'd say, *\"hey, kid, i appreciate the effort, but we can't put this out. it's more of a meme than a political ad. but feel free to do what you want with it, as long as it doesn't have any party branding on it.\"* let the kid post it to /r/cpc (which curiously is [still touting all things #scheer](https://web.archive.org/web/20210814191625/https://old.reddit.com/r/cpc/))  or his own twitter account. maybe it goes viral on conservative message boards and facebook feeds; maybe he gets some good feedback... but then it's just a joke made by some kid and that limits the risk. 

it's like trying to have o'toole sending out two sets of messages: a hardline message to cpc supporters and a softer message aimed at everyday canadians. the two signals end up being at odds. typical memes behave the same way: they can only be a message to supporters. and as such, in a democracy where you need more than just your hardcore supporters to vote for you, you can't have those supporter-focused memes come from the top.",conservatives

american leftists (i mean the real left, not the democratic party) in general are *far* more critical of american empire and america's behaviour on the world stage than their canadian counterparts. following their lead a little too much, canadian leftists are quick to decry america's bad behaviour, but either have nothing to say about canada's, or else are champions of it. we overwhelmingly subscribe to the national mythology.

i'm reminded of a story chomsky once told, about how canadians loved to hear him talk about american crimes (because contrasting ourselves positively against the united states is part of this country's national mythology), we eat that shit up, but he found this a little too convenient, so in an interview with peter gzowski he started talking about some of lester pearson's imperialist actions and undermining the national mythology, and gzowski was offended and immediately started behaving exactly as any american mainstream media journalist would if they were listening to chomsky detail american crimes.",liberals
