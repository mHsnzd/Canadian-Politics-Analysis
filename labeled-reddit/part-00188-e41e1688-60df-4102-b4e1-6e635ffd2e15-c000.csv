2. those same services are disinclined to engage in onerous and expensive review and enforcement for tiny markets (see also: facebook's response to australian legislation)

let's be real: canada isn't going to be able to stop wrongthink on parler or gab. it's not going to be able to censure misinformation on mastodon. and canada certainly won't ever cause facebook or reddit to meaningfully enforce canada's rules; at most, they'll do the bare minimum to appear to be cooperating, at worst they'll simply block canadian access.

not at all. i'm describing the cold facts of a gun massacre that was meticulously  recorded on security cameras. i can't help it if it makes you emotional or hurts your feelings. you should know the cold, hard facts about what these guns were designed to do  and not be surprised at the facts. i understand your extreme enmotonal attachemnt to your gun though, and why this would disturb you.

&gt;\"the mini-14 rifle, designed and developed by sturm ruger, is in widespread use as a ranch rifle, defensive weapon, and even a hunting arm\" - no where does it list it not as hunting or ranch rifle

it is used that way, but that's not what it was designed for. it was designed as a tactical weapon for the military for killing people, which is why mass klillers like it. it is also used to huint small game. it turnout that the same features that make it useful for shooting people on a battle field make it good for killing gophers in the field.

go to the first line on wikipedia:

&gt;the mini-14 is a lightweight semiautomatic rifle manufactured by sturm, ruger &amp; co. used by military personnel, law-enforcement personnel, and civilians.

it's a tactical combat weaponm also sold for hunting. simple truth. gun owners liek to be bad-ass. again, the retired general  in this video says as much about the ar-15, that it will rip out the inside of someone's body. nothng to be emotional about, just a fact that we should deal with.

hfoxs4b,2021-10-06T14:25:09.000-07:00,"controversial senator attended pro-beijing ceremony in vancouver none of the people you've cited call it a genocide. you're attributing claims to historians that they haven't made. yes, dikutter says mao was terrible, murderous etc. but he never calls it a genocide. that is your attribution. give me a quote where dikutter says \"the great leap forward was a genocide.\"  

\\&gt; “it ranks alongside the gulags and the holocaust as one of the three grimmest events of the 20th century. … it was like \\[the cambodian communist dictator\\] pol pot’s genocide multiplied 20 times over.” 

these things are all true. its still not a genocide. a genocide is an intentional extermination of a ethnic, racial, or national group. that was not the great leap forward. it was brutal, callous, ruthless, and violent. but it's not a genocide.  it was very grim and certainly had a larger death toll than some actual genocides, but it was not a genocide itself.  dikutter is funny because you know he really really really wants to call it a genocide because of his ideological and political biases, but knows its historically unjustifiable, so he doesn't. he's at least smart enough not to let his redbaiting fervent anti-communist ideology override his instincts as a historian.

\\&gt; i don't even need to argue that his regime his geocidal since your comment was talking about mao's policies being \"intentional acts of murder

i'm not talking about mao's policies in general. i'm talking specifically about the great leap forward. it wasn't a plan to arbitrarily systematically murder his own people for the hell of it.  that just absurd. it ignores the complex social, economic, and political reasons that grounded glf and instead blames on a single leader being a psychopath

\\&gt;2.5 million people were beaten or tortured to death. if you believe the 30 million figure that is at least 8%. i'm sorry but hungry people don't torture others.

sure. i'm not denying that there was horrible violence, much of which came from authorities. it just wasn't centrally directed by mao. most of this violence erupted locally and spontaneously--hordes of desperate and starving peasants jockeying for scare food scraps from wearied officials is going to be a hotbed of violence. mao did not order his army to go kill 2.5 million people; that number include a multitude of different kinds of violence coming from diffrent parties. when people try to lump in mao with hitler they erase the fact that the nature of the violence was different. hitler literally ordered millions of people to be systematically murdered in industrial fashion because of their race. hitlers crimes are of a different category than maos

\\&gt;mao was qouted as saying horrible things like, \"when there is not enough to eat people starve to death. it is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.\" 

this single quote is cited again and again by anti-mao conservatives. and they keep coming back to it because its the only one they have. but its actually entirely misinterpreted because it is ripped out of context. dikutter falsifies this context around the quote, which is actually a metaphor about industrial production 

`in his article, \"hard facts and half-truths: the new archival history of china's great famine,\" garnaut finds out that the mao quote in question is not from a speech mao delivered on march 25, 1959 as dikötter claims, but it represents an impromptu response mao made to bo yibo's report on the implementation of the industrial plan in the days that followed. \"the comment is preceded by several remarks by mao about party oversight of the industrial sector, none of which touch upon agriculture or rural welfare.\" mao was weighing in on how many projects should be undertaken to accomplish the plan set forth in bo's report. mao says:`  
  
`if we want to fulfill the plan, then we need to greatly reduce the number of projects. we need to be resolute in further cutting the 1,078 major projects down to 500. (要完成计划，就要大減项目。1078个项目中还应該堅決地再多削減，削到500个。)`  
  
`to distribute resources evenly is a way to sabotage the great leap forward. (平均使用力量是破坏大跃进的办法。)`  
  
`if all are unable to eat their fill, then all will die. it is better for half to die, so that half of the people can eat their fill. (大家吃不飽，大家死，不如死一半，給一半人吃飽。)`  
  
https://insideoutchina.blogspot.com/2013/11/better-to-let-half-of-people-die-said.html  


\\&gt;democide historian r.j. rummel believes that the great leap forward constitutes \"democide\". the term is defined as the \"intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their authoritative capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command\" and was developed to cover the shortcomings of genocide and what could be ascribed to it.

rummel is a political scientist not a historian. as you'll see, it is mostly non-historian academics who are eager to label complex events as genocide. i don't see him as a credible source on the matter.

\\&gt;mao saw how quickly the ussr industrialized and tried to replicate it with the same horrific policies like collectivization.

the full extent of the deaths and suffering during the ussr famines only became widespread knowledge after the glf. at the time, and from his standpoint, the ussr collectivization seems like a great success. mao was committed marxist revolutionary and his private writings reveal in earnest attempt to transform society for the better. 

\\&gt;this was nothing but a vain project from an evil man.

 i agree that it was a vain project. he thought it would lead china to great success but it failed due to mismanagement and resulted in a stunning death toll. mao legion of yes-men and inefficient bureaucracy made the party slow/unable to respond which furthered the catastrophic loss of life. that's what it comes down to.",conservatives

the others already have very high penetration of hydro/nuclear/wind/solar and there's not much that can be improved there and in pretty well all cases the federal government would have to coordinate with provincial government to get anything built.

most old growth is not iconic giant cedar.  most old growth occurs on less productive sights and won't ever become large.  large iconic trees when found now require a 1 hectare reserve around them.

the old growth strategic review which was co-authored by an indigenous forester and academics did not call for a ban on logging all old growth.  the report recommended that old growth from biogeoclimatic subzones that are not well represented be protected.  they also recommended that a portion of the forest be managed according to natural disturbance patterns (i.e. fires). they accepted that intensive management on the rest was a good ideas.  a group of 5 academics are currently working on recommendations to identify at-risk old growth meaning remainig old growth in biogeoclimatic subzones that are not well represented by current protections.  there specific recommendations are expected this fall.

this is reasonable balanced approach.  thankfully the government hasn't listened to the activists and immediately put 40,000 people out of work overnight.  

some perspective:
52% of bcs forests will never be logged because it is protected or inoperable.

yes. this is why we need india-like more parties, not allow nazis to gain more seats in the parliament ala germany via pr.

&gt;india uses fptp and it has a fascist hindu supremacist ruling party with a paramilitary arm that styles itself after the brownshirts and admires nazi germany.

this is colonialist hindu-phobia. styling itself after boy and girl scouts is not brownshirts, nor does it 'admire' the nazi party.

&gt;all the while actively passing laws to discriminate against and round up muslims and other minorities, with their current pm implicated in mass pogroms while using fascist national security laws to silent dissent.

speaking of laws, they passed a law that gives muslim women rights to alimony. all the while they were denied this, because the pro-muslim congress party gave muslims special minority rights - exempting them from uniform civil code and allowing sharia law to be the muslim civil law. bjp is changing this, making them come within the democratic fold of ucc.

last i checked, fascists parties do not take on a media fire-storm to give half the people of their 'target' demographics more rights and options.

&gt;pr gives nazis representation and marginalizes them.

pr does no such thing as marginalises them. pr gives them more seats. thats all it does. the marginalisation or not is dependent on the sensibilities and opportunities of the other politicians in the parliament. pr or fptp has jack shit to do with that.

&gt;fptp gives nazis cover to run in bigger tent parties then take them over and rule the country.

only true if you have a paltry number of parties in the parliament. when you have nearly 30 parties in the parliament, this doesn't really work because big tent parties cannot form a majority government 9 outta 10 times anyways.

achieves the same end result as pr in terms of lowering the odds of majoritarian rule, while not suffering from its drawback of giving more seats to nazis.

&gt;yet, no pr system has fallen since the nazis, which only did so because the german establishment decided to hand the keys to powers to the nsdap instead of working with the german communist party.

it is the pr system that arguably gave us the nazis in the first place. german election 1928. nazis won 2.5% vote, got 12 seats. in fptp 2.5% vote share gets you 0-2 seats. thus pr gave nazis a massive boost initially and got them up and running.its doing the same thing for the modern incarnation of the german nazi party - the afd. two elections running.

a the prejudice card. that's just straight up hilarious. making absolutely no reference to the religion of their constituents and i'm still the bigot.

i can point to several militant groups, probably the largest is this one. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rashtriya_swayamsevak_sangh

which follows an ideology of hindutva just like the bjp, with multiple important ministers being former members of the rss.

&gt;as for their policies - well they became the first party in indian history to give muslim women the right to alimony, which they were previously denied under the sharia law preferential treatment of muslims for civil law under indian legal system. far cry from so-called islam-hater wannabe-hitler. unless ofcourse, you can show hitler passing such legislation that massively favour a large sections of jewish people during his tenure. 

they also made homosexuality a criminal offence, what do you call that? one of the major goals of the bjp was to have a centralized legal code, at the expense of whoever wasn't in the governments policy. 

&gt;i don't care much for the example of the most primitive democracy in existence

should i start quoting you as westernphobic like an idiot? or should i just point out that it is faaaaaaaaaaaar from being primitive, their system is extremely complex.

&gt;but also hands more seats to the nazis and various other extremists than fptp.

that's a fair point regarding the demand portion. demand is abetted by variety as well. if consumers have little to choose from, they may not be interested in the market. this would be abetted by the zev mandate. increased competition between companies to capture this market helps to increase the quality of these vehicles as well.

i noticed i was shadowbanned on the r/halifax sub. i messaged the mods to ask why. no response. i then messaged them individually. i received no response but i received a message i was banned permanently from the sub. i then messaged the mods and told them their actions, on a small scale, were parallel to how some oft criticized regimes in the world disappear and silence their citizens. i was then muted and sent a warning from reddit that i was reported for personal harassment.


the experience was interesting and instructive about power dynamics. i was in a position where very civil inquiries questioning the shadowban were met with a full ban and still no explanation. the only options left were to 1)forget about it and not post on r/halifax 2)break the rules and make more accounts to avert ban 3)message the mods again, knowing they had no intentions of responding, and breaking harassment rules.    

obviously a world apart but i can't help feel that young palestinians whose memories include their neighbours houses being bulldozed and their schools, hospitals, electric and water facilities being bombed might feel similar strapped with options. do nothing and watch neighborhoods get bulldozed and settled. do something and then be told, 'you're being naughty for no justifiable reason! you must be punished until you are not naughty.' then, when not naughty, settlement continues. it's got to be a bit confusing when it doesn't matter what actions you take the results are more occupation. the remaining options are to happily 'be good and be occupied, or be naughty according to imposed rules, at which point any response is 'justified' punishment",liberals

well they get punished for being vocal and whipped. when dissident ndp voted to end the gun registry they were punished for not respecting a whipped vote. some even left the ndp over the mater. the green party's first mp other than may was a new democrat that crossed the isle to join the green after being demoted by the ndp for standing up to gun rights.

the provincial alberta ndp voted in favor along side the upc in a motion opposing trudeau's gun control effort. as you noted the alberta ndp is more moderate than federal party. that connotation among voters may mean albertans have a different impression of the ndp than the rest of us.

&gt;the idea that the lpc are a more statist party than one literally founded by socialists, and whose economic policy leans towards nationalization (if not necessarily going that far), is mind-boggling to me. the ndp today are the polar opposite of libertarian.

not at all. the liberals support drug prohibition. the ndp believes in decriminalizing all drugs. as noted the ndp is dividen on gun control. where as the liberals unanimously support gun prohibition. jagmeet's take on banning assault weapons during las election was to leave it up to the cities (greater decentralization than the liberal). trudeau's take was of a national prohibition of \"assault weapons\".

 liberals insisted on passing assisted dying bill in unconstitutional form limiting it only to those with a near and foreseeable death where as ndp supported a more liberal implementation to make it constitutional in line with supreme courts ruling of being eligible for having a \"grevious\" and \"irridemable\" condition.

ndp opposed c-51 liberals supported it, voted for it, said they opposed it but voted for it so they wouldn't look bad. trudeau promised a mending it, mulcair promised repealing it. since trudeau hasn't made any ammendments to protect privacy or over reach.

it's not about rich/poor here. it's about not actually thinking ahead as a group. alberta could have been fine after oil crashed, but thanks to harper and kenney, all of your eggs were in the oil and gas basket. all of the wealth was extracted, and it all left once the good times fell. 

low taxes isn't an inherently good thing. a pst could have saved all your butts years ago, but alberta is stubborn as a mule and obsessed with understanding things the way they feel rather than the way they are.

trudeau is a lot smarter and a much better politician than many give him credit for. he achieved a miracle reviving the nearly destroyed liberal party and leading them to a majority, and the policy book he did it with was first rate.

his record on implementing those policies is mixed. we have legal marijuana (yay!), a world class child benefit (yay!), some movement on indigenous issues (yay?), a carbon tax (yay!) but not enough progress on the paris targets (meh?). his record on trade (cusma and ceta) is excellent, but he disappointed many of his natural allies by ditching electoral reform (boo!).

the biggest issue for me is that he has a gigantic ethical blindspot that has led to a range of ethical scandals, some of them meaningless (nannygate, elbowgate), some of them devastating (snc-lavalin, we?), and some in between (aga khan). he has also centralized power in the pmo at least as much as harper did, and failed to provide the transparency and accountability that he promised to hook people like me in the early days.

he has done a pretty good job on covid, and given the dumpster fires next to us, and where lots of us came from, pretty good may be good enough.

quite a bit of a mixed bag, but i would rate him as better than average, and i think history will as well. subjectively, i'd say he was about as good as chretien or mulroney, better than martin, much better than harper, and campbell wasn't in the job long enough to know.",liberals

i think most people read *chaouli,* and the other recent charter jurisprudence to say yes, there absolutely is, even if only on s. 15 grounds without getting into s. 7. though of course it is very difficult to reconcile decisions like *carter* with any of the reasons from *morgentaler* that aren't justice wilson's. i'm looking forward to the ccla's charter action succeeding on that basis.",liberals

h6s1ysy,2021-07-27T11:36:45.000-07:00,"trudeau says ottawa withholding ‘millions of dollars’ from n.b. over abortion access its not protected by the charter.   the supreme court of canada demanded that the government create a new abortion law to replace the previous one that it struck down in 1988 - and that previous law was that abortion was illegal, and abortionists were criminals, and it was a trudeau liberal law  - no recent government has been brave enough to draft a new abortion law - that's put us in a party of 4 countries with no abortion law.   all our political parties have been cowards on the subject, and no one dog whistles on the subject more these days than the liberals yet they do nothing to enshrine access in law.   liberals rushed when the supreme court demanded a same-sex law, they rushed when the supreme court demanded a euthanasia law, but when the supreme court demands an abortion law they cower like all the parties (well mulroney tried twice).  the liberals stop honest debate on the subject from happening.

also, funding health services is the federal role.  delivering them is the provincial role.  coverage in provinces varies because of this with some things covered and other things not covered from province to province.  that's how it should be.    and new brunswickers should decide for themselves, not the rest of canada on what and how they deliver health services.   and yes, this should include abortion.   but my understanding is that the argument isn't that new brunswick doesn't offer it, it doesn't offer it throughout the province and there are likely reasons for that - much like an ontarian may have to go to toronto or ottawa for a particular service or care that is covered.  or a quebec may have to go to montreal or quebec city for some particular service or care that is required.

and guess what there are many that are not pro-life or pro-choice.  there are many who like the solutions and laws in european countries that have limits and rules - some think if its elective it shouldn't be public funded, some think only medically necessary ones should be preformed, etc... its not a two side debate and liberals try over and over again to play it like it is two sided - because they are cowards.  they selectively listen to the supreme court.    we need a law.  but with trudeau you won't get one - you'll get petty politics like what he's doing now and he shouldn't be allowed.    i'm not pro-choice nor pro-life and canada's on-demand situation that is publicly funded for even elective abortions shouldn't sit well with most - what other elective procedures are publicly funded?  especially when there are plenty of means to prevent pregnancy to begin with.  o the rape argument again, fine, file a rape accusation with the police and save the dna evidence from the abortion.  and you know what.   this is why canada sucks on this issue - no reasonable discussion can happen because of the polar opposite sides that pretend we are on one side or the other - most of us aren't.  most reasonable people would want a ban on abortions when the child is viable outside the womb and poses no danger to the mother - like after 26 weeks or whatever modern medicine can handle.    no i don't think everyone who gets an abortion is evil, but some who do as a form a birth control are disgusting and perhaps evil.  i think every hospital should have someone trained in abortions if possible - but i understand if doctors don't want to learn that or perform one unless its to save the life of a mother.   all i am saying is that is there is plenty of people who don't fit into the extreme views of pro-choice or pro-life.",liberals
