as interest rates start to climb people who bought homes in the last few years with the minimum down are going to be brutally hard pressed to keep those homes.  even if housing prices come down a little new home buyers won't be able to afford them becuase the mortgage payments will go up, meaning that more investors with cash in their pockets will snatch up homes. the economy in general will slow down and food will climb even more. especially if trudeau actually does continue to raise carbon taxes as promised, a thing that got glossed over during the election.  which he will do when enviro groups point out he's not hitting his goals, because he's got very little else in his toolbox to fight climate change. 

and there's signs of a world wide slowdown on the horizon. which is about what would be expected from the damage done by covid combined with the fact we were about due for one. 

no matter what happens with trudeau, whether he decides to stay or resign and allow a new leadership race, it's not likely that the libs will be interested in risking another 'snap election' anytime in the next 2 years (probably more like 3) and the ndp isn't going to be interested in bringing them down, so by the time we get to the next election things are likely to be pretty bad.",liberals

but to be quite frank, i'm doubting the short to medium term capacity of the liberal party to make inroads in anglophone new brunswick. and it's not because they've done anything wrong, it's because they've been unfortunately cast by the panb &amp; nb pcs as the \"francophone party\" in the latter parties' anti-francophone dog-whistling march. 

\"i'm not getting ahead because of francophones/bilingualism\" and \"french services are hindering our fiscal capacity as a province\" are sentiments that have been pushed by panb &amp; nb pcs, and have risen dramatically in anglophone new brunswick. the people prone to that kind of populism are never going to vote for what they see as the \"phonie party /sanb party\", but they might give the nb greens a try if that populism is channeled into a rage against against the status quo elites/parties instead. 

votes for the nb greens have included disaffected liberal voters, disaffected tory voters, anti-pc &amp; lib voters, and a whole new batch of voters that had never bothered voting before. and despite having an identical position on francophone rights to the nb libs, they benefit from being seen as a party that transcends linguistic lines, unlike the pcs and libs. the green's focus on local governance also attracts rural voters in a way the liberals don't. 

as things stand now, i believe the liberals will only be able to win back anglophone voters when the pcs, under a new leader (possibly cardy) return to being a hatfield &amp; lord pro-bilingual party. when voters will have to vote for parties with similar positions on bilingualism, the linguistic divide will disappear as it previously did under lord. but only until then.",liberals

liberals also want to make handguns a municipal decision. what kind of government would take the duties of the feds/rcmp/cfo and put them into the laps of city politicians.... this will create a dogs breakfast of splinter laws and litigation mess similar to the issues we see in the states.  
  
it would have been actually nice to see the earlier bill discussed in the hoc but jt and blair used the oic to avoid democratic discussion (as they don't have a majority). liberal party also flat out ignored the largest e-petitions in canadian history expressing their frustration and disagreement.  
  
they've also buried/lumped airsoft and paintball into these bills thus potentially banning it killing thousands of jobs, small businesses and sporting communities. the uk has airsoft and paintball but with a registered system. or in the u.s. state california requires orange tips. how will banning a sport played by peoples of all kind aged 15-50 keep the streets safe? the political spin is claiming airsoft and paintball is a gateway to mischief and crime. really...? personally, i've only had responses on the issue from conservative mps. as well local mps went to local fields in b.c. to talk to business owners and players. not sure of others experiences.  
  
we have an estimated 12.7 million+ guns in canada and estimated 3 million pal/rpal card holders. average value of a firearm in canada is estimated at $500-600 +taxes, assuming 100% compliance would cost closer to $6-7 billion.

  
what i don't understand is why the liberal party seems to want to strawman this topic when the public was making these budget issues and biased policy apparent from the very start.

gyw4i1v,2021-05-20T11:04:18.000-07:00,"quebec can modify part of the canadian constitution unilaterally, trudeau says canada's constitution is explicitly similar in principle to the constitution of the united kingdom (in 1867), with the provisions of the constitution layered over top of those principles. courts look at the history of the united kingdom and its constitutional development, as well as canada's development and past court decisions about the principles of canada's constitution in order to identify features which are fundamental to the character of its institutions. without knowledge of this constitutional and juridical history, it would be hard to identify which changes are likely to be considered to alter the architecture of canada's constitution by changing the character of its institutions.

anyways, it does not follow that because parliament is empowered to alter the constitution of the executive, the house, and the senate that any given particular change would be within its powers, especially where there's a potential interaction with subjects covered by sections 41 and 42 of the constitution act, 1982.

this is section 44:

&gt; 44 subject to sections 41 and 42, parliament may exclusively make laws amending the constitution of canada in relation to the executive government of canada or the senate and house of commons.

\"subject to sections 41 and 42\" tells us that there are changes that could otherwise be made under section 44 which must instead be made under sections 41 or 42. you cannot reason from the generality of the provision that it must be universally applicable.

second, it explicitly lists the executive government, the senate, and the house of commons. it does not list the parliament of canada. the role of the crown in parliament is thus excluded from amendment under this section. this means the power to summon, dissolve or prorogue parliament and to assent to laws, as well as certain other provisions relating to money bills cannot be altered under section 44.

i would expect the fact that the executive government is vested in the crown also cannot be changed, though i'm not fully confident on what the core features are that cannot be changed are about the crown's executive role. i would think the appointment of ministers is fairly critical though, for example. i would suspect that the spending money appropriated through parliament by the executive branch also has to ultimately be approved by the crown, irrespective of what additional executive processes and approvals parliament may require.",liberals

to reward you for lowering your emissions. that's literally the whole point of the flat refund system compensating for the increase in prices. this is what people have been screaming to conservatives about for years because they simply refuse to understand how the current system works (or understand but refuse to acknowledge). 

if you give everyone $500 and gas goes up $.50/l for a given time period, you've shifted the incentives such that everybody is paying more for gas but nobody who buys less than 100*0*l comes out behind. you've shifted the cost of emissions onto the consumer without hurting the little guy. you've shifted the cost benefit balance of every purchasing decision you make, whether it's literally gas or indirectly affecting price (i.e.: buying from a company that delivers in efficient vehicles will become cheaper than companies that deliver in inefficient ones).",conservatives

\"on december 12, 2003, after paul martin became prime minister, he appointed bennett as his minister of state for public health.[13] in her two years as minister, she set up the public health agency of canada, appointed the first chief public health officer for canada, and established the public health network.\"

i mean on paper at least she has solid credentials in terms of what she can bring to the table in this portfolio. 

pm trudeau must see something of worth in her to give her this portfolio that is pretty much a response to one of his campaign promises iirc. 

anyway, we'll see. i'm not totally discounting her.",liberals

it's really that simple my friend. if a turban should be banned by your twisted rationale, then so should a woman teacher who shaves her head to donate her hair to cancer patients. i mentioned this point in my earlier comment but you conveniently left it unaddressed. such a woman is also proclaiming that things should be a certain way. such a woman is saying that it is good to uplift cancer patients, that it is good to uplift the needy. are you prepared to say such a woman should be banned from teaching in quebec? if not, you are a massive hypocrite. there are countless other examples like this that could be constructed based on your rationale. 

if all it takes for something to be banned is \"it is in some sense about what the person stands for in their personal life\", then the bar is set simply way too low. you would then have a person banned for having a rainbow coloured handkerchief because it's potentially related to gay pride. the person could deny it and say they simply wear the handkerchief out of aesthetic preference and then would you be okay with it? could a turban wearer do the same? once the turban wearer claims it is worn simply for aesthetics would you  have no problem with it? how do you test a person's intentions? what a shitshow. 

i don't think you actually have a problem with people wearing anything that is related to their view of the world. i think you have a problem with certain expressions of that from particular cultures. otherwise you would be just as opposed to the bald woman teacher i outlined, as well as the handkerchief wearer, and a million other examples.

the days when quebecois voted liberal in drove and delivered almost all the quebec seats to is over, since the repatriation of canadian constitution. the subsequent liberal victories were due to 1) complete sweep of ontario, some seats in western canadian cities, plus 30-45% of quebec seats during chrétien’s rein. 2) very good performance in ontario (getting 60-70% of seats) plus a decent showing (30-45% in quebec) in quebec and urban cities of western canada (2004 with paul martin, and 2015-2021 with justin trudeau). if you looked at the times that liberal won in modern times, you can see that these leaders were all quebecers who can connect with a huge section of the people in the province. whether freeland or carney or any other anglophone lpc leaders can do the same is very much a question mark. liberal might have some hard times with winning north and south shores  of greater montreal and eastern townships, where white francophone voters are willing to vote for blocs if the liberal leaders cannot connect with them",liberals

which i understand, and have not denied.  i have not once challenged the legitimacy of trudeau being in the pm's office.

you do not understand my point.  the country is divided politically, and drifting further apart.  the people who vote for the most popular political party in the country are becoming increasingly angry, and for very good reason.  if they are the largest voting block, why are they perpetually in opposition?

i understand the system, including the flaws therein.  every system has a flaw or two, and i think fptp is the best offered.  unfortunately in the current era of chaos, everything has aligned to keep trudeau in office.  with a better man, even that would be a-ok, but trudeau is so damned ideologically driven, dishonest, idiotic, and arrogant that he is driving wedges between the people of canada, dividing them into opposing camps, and inspiring much rage.

but you're correct that traditional means won't solve the problem, largely because the cause isn't 'traditional'. this is more of a 'man made' phenomenon based on how we handled covid than it is a natural market effect.  you raise rates to cool the economy and slow demand to fight inflation - in this case it wasn't a hot market that created the problem, it's the trillion dollars in unearned money they dumped into the market place. repressing the economy with higher interest would likely lead to the worst kind of crash. but their other choices are also limited. and of those choices many are contradictory. for example, you can raise taxes to cool the economy,  and you can increase business opportunity and training to fight stagflation, but increasing taxes hurts business opportunity.  tax increases are genearally less 'jarring' on the economy than interest rate increases but they take much longer to work which means inflation continues longer.  they can cut back on covid relief and that would help a lot but that creates employment issues and is very unpopular.

hb9ymgo,2021-09-01T14:11:25.000-07:00,"liberal party of canada platform: \"forward. for everyone.\" good stuff:

- cht will now include extra funding earmarked for mental health

- paid sick leave (for federally regulated workers)

- funding incentives for cities that are tied to densifying, inclusionary zoning, and/or faster building approvals

- affordable child care

- the climate plan: carbon border tariffs are there. so are methane targets, zev targets, clean electricity standards. for the first time, they're presenting a ghg target that would actually satisfy our \"fair share\" for a 2-degree warming target

- convening experts into a \"digital policy task force\". god knows the liberals need help here lol (see below).

- alternative minimum tax

yes, but ...

- commitments to offer more self-determination to indigenous groups. awesome. but this section doesn't really have a lot of 

- funding to reduce healthcare wait times. hey, never heard that one before! i'll believe it when it happens. i'm not sure throwing a one-and-done $6b at the issue is going to solve it once and for all.

- ban \"foreign money\" in housing. how is this defined, and how would you enforce it? 

- supporting francophone immigration outside of quebec. i'd love for that to happen, but i don't think it will generate much results.

- they're the only party to cost things so far (yay!) and look, there's a declining debt-to-gdp ratio as usual! surely they won't introduce so much new spending again in the next budget or next election campaign to prevent that, right?

things that don't make sense to me:

- more subsidies to help people buy homes. i'm sorry, stimulating demand isn't going to make housing affordable.

- increasing subsidies for seniors over 75. pretty sure seniors have the lowest poverty rate of all the generations right now - is this really the right place to target money?

- supply management. yes, i get it. protectionism is table stakes to campaign in quebec. every party supports it. no, that doesn't make a dairy-and-maple-syrup cartel a good idea.

- their handling of internet issues. i'm still unconvinced that there's a major threat to canadian content creators in the digital age, and even if there is, i think the internet is a different enough medium from tv that you can't just copy over the existing cancon framework and call it a day. also (and in fairness, the cpc platform also says this) they want social media giants to share revenues with news organizations *when news articles are posted on the platform*. facebook is killing newsprint because they're able to target advertising more effectively, not because people are posting links to newspaper articles on facebook (which actually drive traffic to the newspaper). telling facebook \"the more publicity you give them, the more you pay\" actually incentivizes them to *suppress* good journalism. it makes about as much sense as the cpc low-carbon reward points.

wtfs:

- there's a lot of \"we'll re-introduce this bill which died because the election was called, within 100 days\" promises. you know, you could have just not had the election now.

- \"ensure fair and equitable compensation\" for first nations victims of the child welfare system. sure, sounds good, but why aren't they settling instead of continuing their court case against a bunch of kids who lower courts have found they owe compensation to?

what's missing:

- any details about foreign policy. it's a complete afterthought. yes, i know very few people care about it, but it's still a vital part of what the federal government does.

i guess it's a decent platform, but nothing spectacular. i think i'd still prefer a liberal government over a conservative one if only for climate and child care. the ndp has some things i really like (electoral reform, strong indigenous policy), but it just reads more like a statement of values than a serious plan for governing (a basic income is in there, and they say they're inspired by the cerb - which was temporary spending which isn't sustainable in the long term; and the platform doesn't generate anywhere near enough revenue to pay for it). i'd be interested to see whether they ever get around to costing it. the ppc's got a few stopped-clock moments like removing internal trade barriers and supply management; but otherwise it's everything i'm against in politics. and are the greens even running a campaign?

i feel like there's no choices i'm enthusiastic about voting for. probably going to end up landing on red or orange; but if only they'd promised not to touch the climate plan, i might have went blue.",liberals

that really depends. there are three possibilities:

2. if the house does not have confidence in trudeau, but the ndp, bloc, and cpc have indicated they've come to a governance arrangement, the gg could deny an election and recognize that new government.

3. if the house does not have confidence in trudeau, and the bloc, ndp, and cpc *do not* indicate they've come to a governance arrangement, but implore the gg to deny an election anyway, the democratic will of the house is in tension with established constitutional convention, and the gg should call an election.

i have zero expectation that elected officials are better human beings than anyone else or shining examples of anything.  maybe that comes from not being born in canada and recognizing that politicians here are also quite often people of poor moral fibre who get where they are because they know how to say the right things to the right people at the right times.

he has left ontario for non essential travel, to another province. with his security and house staff.

interprovincial non essential travel by the prime minister, and all premiers in canada is strong discouraged. 

the rest of residents in ontario are told by public health not even to leave their homes, let alone travel to another city in ontario. 

the finance minister of ontario resigned his post as he was caught doing non essential travel.

note that r/canadapolitics deleted the post as they claimed the article could not be substantiated. as it was quite clear that he had travelled by parliamentary reporters, the only conclusion that could be made is that either canadapolitics condones breaking public health relations or curate their sub for the liberal party.

&gt;social conservative mps insist they did not know this would mean the leader’s office would propose a unanimous consent motion right after question period that day. in a letter to supporters, manitoba mp ted falk described mps being caught by surprise. “before i could process what was happening, the motion had been passed,” the mp for provencher said.

my point by bringing up renaming streets is that it looks good and positive but it often ends there, without actually addressing wider systemic issues or putting in the work to actually do the million other things to correct the historical record and improve things materially for marginalized groups. all it does is make the right throw temper tantrums like this.

edit: i read this as performative as the rbcm clearly has a history of taking on indigenous staff and losing them because they don't actually change their internal culture. i can only gather based on the testimony of former staff that these people aren't being listened to and treated less like people with meaningful contributions to make from lived experience but more as tokens to tick off items on a checklist.",liberals
