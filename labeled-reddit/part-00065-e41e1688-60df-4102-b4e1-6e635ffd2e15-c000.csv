i'm gonna answer this politely and as in good faith as possible, although i'm sure i'll still get a lot of vitriol, despite whether or not i, personally, believe in it. it's because québec is a secular society that sixty years ago, banned the crosses from the court houses and the nuns from the classrooms. most québeckers are two generations deep of keeping faith separate from government. and with the push for increased immigration (of which we are almost always polled as the province who most welcomes immigration) there is now more interest in having it be an across-the-board rule about faith based iconography intermingling with civil service. it's not that much of a stretch to consider, especially when it comes to things like items of islamic significance, since it's an abrahamic faith just like catholicism. calling it racist is out of touch, in my opinion, because it's faith based, not race based. it's similar to how a lot of western atheists who are tired of judeo-christian values driving a lot of state decisions somehow don't have the same issues with muslim ideals fogging the lines. it's just that this province has had an attitude of \"keep it in church, please\" since the quiet revolution. it's part of québec's approach to integration as interculturalism rather than multiculturalism, where integration is considered to be a two way understanding.",liberals

aside from those considerations, the problem is ultimately that there's a tension between autonomy and having a reliable coalition partner. if the party's too autonomous, it's unreliable, but otherwise, it may lose its appeal among quebecers. i guess the caq is a sort of blueprint for how this could work, with agreement along economic issues, but divergence on identity, etc.

gtf0onc,2021-04-04T13:33:24.000-07:00,"let's face it -- erin o'toole is a dud okay on second thought, i'm not sure i'd put o'toole above ambrose.  it's hard to compare because she wasn't a permanent party leader, so she didn't have to take as many policy stances.

but i would put him above harper and scheer.

the main reason is that climate change is a top issue for me, and so far, o'toole is signalling that he recognizes that it's an important issue, and that he'll propose some sort of serious climate plan.  i don't think scheer or harper ever cared about the issue or took it seriously, and it showed in their policies (and even scheer's [tweet](https://twitter.com/andrewscheer/status/1375512393401307136) last week).  i'm cautiously optimistic that o'toole will put forward a decent climate plan.  probably not as strong as the liberal, ndp or green plans, but stronger than other conservatives would.

another reason is that on a personal level, o'toole seems more moderate and less ideologically right-wing than  scheer and harper.  not everyone agrees with my view of harper, but i think he's actually an extremely right-wing individual, but he has great self-control and understands politics well, so he reined it in while he was party leader.  but some of the stuff he's said post-politics, especially when he's being interviewed in the us, makes it clear that he's further to the right than a lot of canadians wanted to believe.

lastly, o'toole has some varied life experience outside of politics (in the military and working as a lawyer), which i generally view as a plus.  harper and especially scheer didn't have that - harper's entire career was working as a politician, a political staffer, or at a political think tank, and scheer has been an mp since he was 24.  when someone's entire adult life is in partisan politics, i think that sometimes gives them a skewed worldview where they get too caught up in partisan fights and scoring political points, rather than focusing on the actual importance of issues and how they affect real people. scheer and poilievre (both mps since they were young) are examples of this. it's possible the outside perspective might be one reason why o'toole seems more willing to go against the grain of his party on topics like climate and unions.

as i mentioned before, i'm not a conservative voter and don't think i'll be voting for them in the election.  but if i had to pick either o'toole, harper or scheer to be our pm, i'd prefer o'toole.",conservatives

but then you get into this knee jerk reactions over people discussing dog whistles and claiming that term is dumb when in fact it describes a very real and harmful phenomenon. we can’t have good discussions if we can’t discuss bad faith hints toward extreme elements of society frankly. 

otherwise one side can literally dog whistle all the way to literally terrorizing a minority group (i.e stochastic terrorism) and never be criticized once for it despite how clearly bad faith that is. 

i also think you’re misguided if you think simple discussion, especially on the internet, is what persuades people with opposed view points to find common ground. i think it’s clear that the opposite is true and what actually works is face to face relationships with some sort of emotional connection.

debate and discussion are all well and good, but at the end of the day they’re not much more than extravagant intellectual exercises. in my experience the people who forget this are often the ones who frankly wind up pummelling minorities with a whole bunch of “debate” where they’re expected to justify their humanity in an ironically very dehumanizing way.

that meant professionally-produced shows or songs streamed on crave, netflix, amazon prime or spotify would be subject to crtc regulation, while music videos on youtube, posts made to facebook or podcasts uploaded to apple podcasts would be exempt — because they are uploaded to those platforms by individual users.

so... regulating media. whats your concern there?

there just isn't a coalition culture in canada, though we've seen recent examples of \"supply and confidence\" agreements provincially. such agreements include a few concessions from the governing party to the supporting party and there is a deal to ensure the governing party doesn't fall until x date (usually 18 months). but these aren't classic coalitions like in europe or nz where you'd see the supporting party gain ministries or participate in government in one way or the other. 

2) the most likely result in this election is another liberal minority. which just shows you how pointless this election is. the liberals calling a snap election 2 years before the end of their mandate (october 2023) is a transparent power grab for a majority that's backfiring as the public rejects the need to go to the polls at all. unless debates ( early september) turn things around,  liberals will repeat their 2019 performance.

hac024v,2021-08-25T05:48:12.000-07:00,"ndp makes 'aggressive' push for progressive voters to ditch trudeau for something new i'll explain it the same way that every other liberal democracy with a single-member plurality system works.

the demographics between the vast majority of **canadians** and the vast majority of **canadian voters** is very different.

the liberals work well to get elected because they campaign on the left, but govern to the right, long after canadians have forgotten to keep up with federal politics. the performative theatrics of the liberal party combined with the massive purse for campaigning (*cough* corporate lobbying *cough*) leads to the lpc being able to reach out to a wider audience with their \"progressive platform\" while not doing anything once in office to materially change it.

i don't know how you can ignore that the liberal government is also campaigning on many of those same platform goals and suggest that canadian's \"don't support this platform\".

[party positions, income inequality, and voter turnout in canada, 1984-2015 -matthew polacko](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002764220941238)

&gt; past research has tended to offer support for either relative power or resource theory. this study offers evidence in support of the former, as it finds that income inequality does significantly reduce turnout in canada, with low-income earners negatively affected the most. past research has also offered little support in favor of conflict theory. however, by examining the economic policy space of canada’s party system, we can provide a more direct test of conflict theory. the results here indicate that latent conflict (meltzer &amp; richard, 1981) only manifests from increasing income inequality—when parties offer greater redistribution. as this article shows that the negative effects of inequality on turnout can be mitigated with party system movements to the left on matters of redistribution, which is especially pronounced for low-income earners. this finding is particularly relevant to current policy debates, since turnout decline in canada coincided with a strong rightwards policy shift on redistribution (banting &amp; myles, 2013; johnston, 2017). **turnout also substantially increased in the 2015 election to the highest level since 1993, with inequality a salient issue during the campaign, and the liberal’s moving to the left of the new democratic party on redistribution for the first time since the cmp began coding elections in 1945.**

i showed you the polling data and that data is not made up of random canadians from this sub.

thus, i believe that i have proved my point that it's not the platform but views of the party (racial views, partisan lenses, generational voting etc...) that's the problem.",liberals

except, the wages and benefits of an mp or mla aren't quite enough to justify screwing over your countrymen, so there is agreed upon a bonus at the delivery of service - often a multi-year contract for a 6 or 7 figure job at a firm or agency, to which one is never really expected to show up at or do anything.

the catch?  you can't collect on it while you are still in office.

so, in a ballet of cooperation which would shock most voters to comprehend, they gamely take turns building their popularity, governing for a hand-full of years, fulfilling their obligations, then tanking their brand and stepping down into lavish retirement, while the \"other\" national party overtakes them and does the exact same thing.  in 6 or 8 years, their party will have rebuild again and, once more, be fit to run - and the other party will be set to cash their chips in by then, too.

this paragraph in particular struck me as funny
&gt;o’toole’s election policy platform pledges to continue a slightly modified version of the cews  program, rebranded as the “canada job surge plan,” but his plan fails to include any measures to eliminate fraud,  demonstrating his deep political intimacy with the very “elite” against which he claims to stand. 

no party in this election has called for additional anti-fraud measures to cews that i could find. the ndp's peter julian said cews was too restrictive and they pushed for a more flexible cews:
&gt;right now, if a business loses less than 30 per cent of their revenue they don’t qualify for the cews. this arbitrary number chosen by the government is unfairly leaving too many businesses without the support they need. under the ndp approach, businesses with a smaller loss of revenue could still qualify for a partial wage subsidy so that more businesses get support.

regard the boston university data, i think it's important to recognize that is coming from the us. note how the author responds to a question about new zealand, which is more comparable to canada:

&gt;&gt;[interviewer] after the recent tragedy in christchurch, new zealand, the country’s prime minister announced a national ban on all semiautomatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, and parts that allow weapons to be modified; how do you think this will impact the country?  

&gt;[prof siegel] these policy reforms will likely reduce casualties from mass shootings. one needs to remember, however, that the gun stock in new zealand is much lower than it is in the united states. about 99.9 percent of all [gun-related deaths] in the united states are either suicides, unintentional shootings, or non–mass shooting homicides—none of which will be eliminated by getting rid of assault weapons.

what siegel is proposing is data-backed, but it's clearly also taking the us political context into account. he's pushing for the lowest hanging fruit. in canada we've already dealt with most of the low hanging fruit. we do all of those controls on the *who*, and we could improve them. but our context is closer to new zealand than the us.

while mass shootings are rare, i think siegel downplays their significance because he's trying to get somewhere in an impossible political environment. they are acts of terrorism that have a disproportionate and devastating effect on society, even though they don't have a numerically significant impact. there are stories that cannot be told by numbers alone. when a tragic event like the nova scotia rampage becomes part of our national narrative, we have to respond to it. we have to respond to outbursts of violence, ironically, with disproportionate effort to repair the social contract. (hopefully, in a useful direction.)

i do suspect your wider point stands, that efforts focused on *who* are more effective than *what*. but this only goes so far. the las vegas shooter was a wealthy accountant with no criminal history, no history of violence and no infractions more serious than a speeding ticket – no warning signs. the nova scotia shooter did have a history of violence and there were some tips, but most tips about threats never materialize – he would have been denied a pal, but had the money to buy smuggled guns. more emphasis to *who* would not help in these cases. (perhaps we could explore screening people for psychopathy/antisocial personality disorder in a background check would help, but that has its own problems, among them, ethics.) which means, if we exhaust our options under *who* we'd have to turn to *what*. because all else equal, if someone is going to commit violent crime we'd rather they have a less powerful weapon.

i believe i worded by ccfr point carefully enough: their policy wishlist has no conflict with gun manufacturers and vendors want who also sell products to the us and canada. i could add that it's thin on improving public safety, apart from advocating training. (the ceo also runs a firearms training business.) as a nonprofit organization, they have no obligation to disclose donations and there is no limit to what donations they accept.

but absolutely, it doesn't make much sense to haul a trainload of steel up to kamloops if the same manufacturing could be better done in ontario, where the consumer market and steel mills are, or abroad, where labour is cheaper. if we could attract more industries like that polyethylene plant, industries that play to our strengths by being located where their ingredients are, then that'd be just as good.

&gt; *it's also noteworthy that all parties' members have, since the introduction of the vaccine, shown increased willingness to get vaccinated. ekos asked essentially the same question back in the 2nd half of november 2020: [\"would you be willing to receive a covid-19 vaccine if one were available?\"](https://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2020/12/pandemic-polarization-and-expectations-for-government/).*

people changed their minds because they saw the evidence. the vaccine was highly effective, limiting both infection and severe disease, and came with relatively mild side-effects. and here, the prime minister is likewise being pragmatic and acting in light of the evidence. 

&gt; so what changed the calculus? canada’s high vaccination rate has meant that the once unpopular idea of vaccine passports is now polling well. 

no, that is not a causal relationship. in my apprehension, it's more the increased *risk* that we now face.

&gt; trudeau’s new found stridency on vaccination is perplexing given his own government’s success in achieving high rates of first and second dose vaccination, the highest in the advanced world. 

sure, it's good, but it's not enough now. covid has evolved and the new delta variant, in particular, is more transmissible. that requires higher levels of vaccination to achieve herd immunity effects. and canada's rate of vaccination has been slowing down for a couple months now.

1. canadian agents questioned him under conditions that violate fundamental justice

2. harper did not seek khadr's return for several years after the us was willing to return him.

\"social issues are inherently economic. it is willfully ignorant to believe that the government can be removed from intervention in the market and to trust the market to uphold equality on its own—one of the focal points of fiscal conservatism—when the government intervened in the economic system to uphold inequality in the first place. long-standing governmental policies of discrimination against and exclusion of people of color have created conditions of systematic poverty and wealth inequality: take, for instance, jim crow laws, the federal housing administration’s explicit policies of “redlining,” and the exploitative sharecropping system during the reconstruction era. it is no coincidence that black college graduate workers make 20 percent less than their white counterparts or that black households have 10 cents in wealth for every dollar a white household has. these are all products of systematic economic oppression.\"

a subsection of our people will see the violence across the world committed by followers of islam and think \"something needs to be done about this\" resulting in shit like this event. what i see is a total shutdown of conversations surrounding islam and it's relationship with women's rights, violence, racism and other problematic things. when conversation is shutdown in some areas, it breeds even more negative conversations elsewhere (as per my initial comment) which turns into extremist acts. you know how the right-wing has this victim mentality? that's only possible in cooperation by the left-wing. acts of censorship, acts of demonizing literally everyone for not towing the line correctly, having the wrong opinions... these mild 'offenses' breed this mentality in these people and eventually it grows into this.

so the blame is largely on the individual, however there are a myriad of factors that got this person to act in such an extreme manner. just as aaron driver, a islamic convert who tried to blow up a mall in london didn't just decide to do it - there were factors that led to his radicalization. we need to focus on what is radicalizing people and address those issues.",conservatives

covid for example - i can agree with anti-lockdown people to some degree. the fact that we just had to do this recent lockdown is ridiculous because if we had done a good job in the beginning it wouldn't have been necessary. so i can agree with the anti-lockdown people, but i can still disagree with some of their perspective. your beliefs don't have to fit neatly into things, nuance is permitted.

so with the actual islamaphobe, we can agree that some elements of islam are really bad. that some people who follow the religion are bad, and their actions go against everything we as westerners support. there is no issue with agreeing here. it's fine that their beliefs and mine align in some ways! it's likely their next step that we'll disgree on, the  \"so what will we do about it\" bit, and so be it, that's where we diverge.

this is an important part of discourse that is tearing our countries apart because it's missing. we should be finding common ground with people we disagree with and then find ways to reduce extremism. perhaps, through some solid conversation you could convince them of a more positive belief related to muslims, but your apprehension of connecting with these people through common ground won't ever permit that in your current state of mind. 

finding and exploring common ground with 'our enemies' is unbelievably important. from there you can sometimes find ways to convince them that how you see things is a bit better than how they see things. without that common ground though... you'll never get there.

this attitude reminds me of the old joke about a policeman finding a drunk on his hand and knees under a streetlight in the middle of the night. the policeman asks what the guy is doing and he says he’s looking for his keys. the policeman then asks where he lost them. the man replies “in the back yard. but there’s more light out here.”

the list is endless, and the common denominator is islam and western values of equality, individualism, liberty (including ideas like of the liberation of the female form), and free speech/offence. when the vatican invades italy and tries to create the christian state based on a literal reading of the books of moses i'll buy your argument that all religions are the same. but the truth is they're not.

i always hear \"follow the science\" but this has turned \"science\" into a religious cult. you only follow it if it's your \"science.\" like what science has shown it's dangerous to launch your boat into a lake or go camping on ontario crownland (some of the most isolated lands on earth)? but the science allows me to go to the corner store, or wait in line at home depot.
 or the science that will inevitably kick in once restaurants open back up, where i wear a mask for 14 seconds to walk to a table, then can take it off for an hour while i eat, drink and talk? does covid only operate at certain heights? is it's infection entirely based on movement? the \"science\" makes no sense at all. 

we want the freedom of choice. people accept risks every day. until now it seems. people need to realize masks are ppe (personal protective equipment) which means it's to protect you. not others, just you. nobody uses the mask properly. once you touch it after putting it on, it needs to be disposed of properly in a biohazard waste bin. also, you can't tell me you feel safe around someone wearing a mask made out of an old shirt or a face shield. there's no science to that, they have not been tested and approved. 

your science relies on a pcr test, and it also relies on incorrect usage of it. it wasn't designed for diagnosing coronaviruses, and they have the limits set too high on it. 

this virus has been politicized, it's not dangerous, the media fear porn surrounding it is. 

i thought there was maybe something to tis virus last year, until it got insanely political, then and there i knew it was a non issue and was going to be used as a pawn. there are many examples of this. people calling trump a racist for shutting down flights from china, it's country of origin, mayor's imposing lockdowns then disregarding their own rules. ford having family over for whatever the holiday was in 2020, trudeau crossing borders to his cottage. should raise red flags for all sides of the aisle, but for some reason or another, it doesn't? if they believe it's so serious, why disregard your own orders? 

the numbers around covid are what's important. not case counts, deaths and hospitalizations, and also ages. most deaths everywhere are people who's age already exceeds the countries average life expectancy and with 2 underlying conditions. so, scientifically, how is this not treated more like the flu, which it's much closer to, except the flu is 5x more likely to kill younger people. we treat it like it's a super contagious version of ebola, which it isn't.

allowing a \"resource\" based system creates two tiers. those who can and those who can't. by eliminating the ability to \"buy\" a better education for their children the wealthy are forced to invest in the system to improve outcomes for all.

its the same with healthcare, once the wealthy are given the option to pay for services outside the bounds of the public system they cease to work for improvements to the system. and once the docors who are top notch realize *they* can cash in on that system, they leave. eventually you end up just like the states. its not rocket science, its just another way to work the \"defund then privatize\" angle that every conservative party on the planet works with.

i don't know if this is a deliberate concerted attempt to just repeat the same talking point over and over and over, again, but this is really misleading.

first off, the uk has a more public system than we do, they don't even have fee for service as doctors are staff of the nhs with a salary rather than private businesses.

second, if you're going to pick countries off a map, you have to provide context and attempt to isolate causal factors, rather than assuming that any differences in a particular ranking are because of public vs private.  there's any number of reasons why some healthcare systems could have better outcomes, including a healthier and more active population, more doctors per capita, more follow-up and preventative care, etc.  none of this has anything to do with public vs. private.

the government definitely campaigned on alleviating housing affordability in 2019. 


the measurements they promised to implement obviously didn't help the issue; it's perfectly valid to point out that they've tried to fix housing in the past and their ideas didn't work.

i think that's the core of the issue with the whole \"6 years to deal with it\" argument. it wasn't a major national issue until now, and without the pandemic it probably would still be an election issue because without covid we'd be maybe where we were in september 2020 as a country with the signs really popping up nationally. 

i agree more should have been figured out (by everyone) sooner in hindsight, but not one party flagged it until this year. so why lay the blame on one party *with the statement that they could have fixed something that 6 years ago that didn't exist nationally 6 years ago*

criticise the policies that brought us here maybe, but the pandemic is really what did it by pouring gas on the fire for high earners with lower costs and wanting more space plus extra hurdles to building supply making the supply issue even worse than it started to be in 2019 in even more places across the entire country.

like o'toole, australia's system was promoted as giving 'choice' to patients.  those who 'choose' to use private insurance receive tax rebates, ostensably because they decrease the demand on the public system, but privately insured individuals still end up burdening the public system if they require er services or have long term issues that aren't profitable enough for the private sector.  overall, despite spending the same amount as canada on health care, around 60% of australians have worse wait times than before the switch for minor issues, and everybody has worse wait times for major issues.",conservatives

&gt; it does seem odd to me to write policy around edge cases like this.

we live in unsettled times. there's no shortage of people who end up getting radicalized (incel, anti-government, islamist, anti-muslim, or whatever) and want to kill a lot of people: the [northern bc murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_northern_british_columbia_murders), the [danforth shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_toronto_shooting), the [toronto van attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toronto_van_attack), the [quebec city shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quebec_city_mosque_shooting), the [parliament shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_shootings_at_parliament_hill,_ottawa), the [toronto 18 bomb plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_ontario_terrorism_plot).

hobbes pointed out that in a state of nature (anyone can do anything), you get an arms-race dynamic. so you need to draw the line *somewhere*. the disagreement is over where the line should be.

like i said, i don't have a problem with guns in general, e.g. for defense against large animals or for hunting. my understanding is that semi-automatic rifles are useful for hunting small, fast-moving animals, but they're typically rimfire (less powerful) rather than centrefire.

looking at other countries, what seems to happen is that the ar-15 and equivalents are legal until there's some horrific shooting (port arthur in australia, christchurch in new zealand), and then they're prohibited. i expect the same thing would happen here in the wake of a mass shooting that's bad enough. but do we really need to wait for that to happen?

we don't want to end up like the us, where the gun culture has become so strong and so enthusiastic that it was impossible to ban the ar-15 even after 20 first-grade students were shot and killed at sandy hook. (the issue is political rather than legal; the us banned the ar-15 and equivalents for 10 years, from 1994 to 2004.)

not shocking at all. liberals are an urban party. rural votes usually go for ndp or cpc. the liberals will come for albertan's guns. the ndp might not. albertan's tend to be more libertarian minded where as the liberals are a very statist party. ndp has this libertarian left back bench. 

it's important to remember the ndp's base historically came from the parries. they were a party founded by socialist farmers in the parries after all. likewise provincial politics in alberta is upc vs ndp and liberals have been sidelined for decades. the popularity of the ndp provincially in alberta and dislike for liberals is likely to translate to support for them federally.

if the ban is temporary i agree, no one sells. 

if it's permanent what are they going to do? hold the asset literally forever? if they aren't already living in the house, which they by definition aren't under the policy, then refusing to sell forever means they lose all of the investment in the house save for any rental income they may be able to make, which is again good cus it would increase rental stock",conservatives

also it doesn't matter what i think. it matters what the voters think. and the voters still seem to more or less like trudeau.",liberals

gvtu77x,2021-04-25T01:56:31.000-07:00,"ginny roth: on housing prices liberals most worried about boomer homeowners capital gains tax on primary properties is a feasible solution if it is a sliding scale, disappearing after five years. so, if you purchase a home and flip it six months later for $50k more, you would pay capital gains on it. this would disincentivize short-term flipping for gain, while also ensuring housing remains a long-term store of wealth. 

bmo proposed a number of policy solutions that i believe are necessary, the above being a potential solution. taxing capital gains on secondary properties is a good policy option as well, as would be ending the blind bidding process for real estate auctions that promote overspending. and, of course, central bank policy to raise the overnight overnight rate could help alleviate immediately.  

i'm not in favor of affordable housing spending because it does not address the underlying issues, but targeted spending is a solid proposal. i struggle to believe that developers cannot afford to build less expensive properties when some developers have increased the price of new builds by $300,000 in the past year (claridge in ottawa, i believe).",liberals

there is plenty of space for housing, look at how much land in our cities is consumed by completely inefficient use of space, like big box stores, giant parking lots, and inefficient sprawling warehouses.

there are intelligent ways to develop that land and turn it into moderately dense mixed-use communities without encroaching on any of its commercial uses, you just can't do that and guarantee everyone a gaudy 3,100 square foot mattamy monstrosity with a 3-car garage.  


a conservative government in the uk released a major housing policy that stated explicitly they can meet all of their housing needs by re-zoning existing land without encroaching on the green belt in any way.",liberals

gvtx7nc,2021-04-25T02:20:25.000-07:00,"ginny roth: on housing prices liberals most worried about boomer homeowners there's a lot that the ford government is doing to promote sprawl which is slipping under the radar too. hamilton is looking at expanding its urban boundary. the area they're looking to expand already struggles under gridlock traffic and brownouts because there's been a boom in suburban housing there for the last decade or so. there's nothing resembling a community gathering point, no walkable areas, two sparse bus lines, and it would eat up prime agricultural land, wetlands, and butt up right against the greenbelt if the expansion happens.

the city is doing this to accommodate the ~200-300,000 more residents it expects in the next 30 years but of course urban advocates got angry that there is no consideration for densification - only expanding the boundary. why? because the provincial government has mandated municipalities to find space for a certain number of new \"ground-oriented\" (i.e. single family) housing units. in hamilton, that number is 100,000 sprawl homes. so the city's hands are tied, they have to provide sprawl or the province will do it for them through mzos.

hamilton in particular has a lot of empty mixed use buildings in the lower city, brownfield infill potential and a ridiculous number of single family homes on large lots along major roads. upzoning could provide many of those units, but the city isn't able to even explore that option thanks to ford.",liberals
gvtyh1w,2021-04-25T02:30:25.000-07:00,"voters divided on budget, with would-be ndp and green voters now less likely to vote liberal it’s tough to gauge how likely self-identified voters are to switch their vote before an election call. many of these decisions are made very close to ballot casting after the parties have released platforms and debated. 

what the poll does show is that the budget didn’t move the needle too much either way...so far. 

the liberals under trudeau are very good communicators and can make anything look nice if given the opportunity, so their framing of the budget and the future of canada may yet move many of those voters, especially if the opposition continues to struggle (with the exception of the ndp who seem to have found their footing under singh).",liberals
