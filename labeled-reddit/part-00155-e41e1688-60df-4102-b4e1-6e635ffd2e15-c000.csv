one other reason for me to hope for a minority parliament after the election is that there will definitely be committee investigation about the entire afghan evacuation. and i don't trust that lpc majority-controlled committees will be as thorough, and certainly less likely to assign blame to anyone within the government.

there's still the possibility that this story could become more \"hot\", with the aug. 30 extraction deadline coming up in just over a week. if, god forbid, we get stories, let alone images or video, of prospective refugees canada was responsible for getting arrested or executed by the taliban, it could capture the public's attention like that of syrian refugees in 2015. not only would the liberals' overall handling of the matter come into question, but it would also bring up the question of whether things would be at least slightly better had trudeau not called the election. while i'm realistic enough to know that there's only so much difference that would make, with ministers out knocking doors, the opposition's attention diverted to the campaign, and the public service in caretaker mode, surely events might have proceeded a bit better had they been able to focus on the issue.",liberals

by your strict definition of \"cut\", trump didn't cut taxes at all, he just slowed their increase. actually, the only periods of tax cuts happen without any legislation whatsoever, since tax revenues decline during recessions. this just confuses the whole matter and obfuscates the role of government in policymaking.

for me, a cut has to do with the impacts of policy on services and disposable income. if tax policy is changed to leave people with greater purchasing power, than taxes were cut. if funding for services become insufficient to meet the government's commitment to universal access to healthcare, then services were cut.",liberals

h9ybusa,2021-08-22T06:52:07.000-07:00,"o'toole acknowledges some conservatives 'frustrated' over carbon pricing plan that's a huge assumption that people who drive gas guzzlers have money locked away in a savings account to pay for green products, what if they don't? you can't really assume the financial situation of anyone, the \"stick\" still exists under o'tooole's plan, it's really just ensuring the that the funds collected from carbon products actually go to solve the problem of climate change.

for your second point, when people receive a rebate from the government, there's no incentive for them to invest into green products, in fact if you're an individual who has little emissions there's no incentive at all! you'll most likely use it for whatever your daily needs are, rent, food, etc. which will all go up due to carbon pricing.

if you are a farmer or a person who lives in the country, you are going to consume more gasoline than someone who lives in the city, this isn't because you are bad person who pollutes for no other reason than you like driving an suv, or a pick up truck, you are polluting because your work, and your livelihood is entirely requires you too with your current equipment. changing out old farming equipment that you've had for years for new electrical equipment, is not cheap, you don't just have savings stowed away. if your business gets taxed further due to a raising carbon tax, then it just gets harder for you to pollute less because you have less money to invest in said equipment!

if you're saying people who pollute need to be taxed more, so their wealth can be redistributed to those who pollute less, based on some perceived morality, then i think the current system would be more beneficial. however i think with o'toole's plan the money collected from the carbon tax will go directly to solving the climate change problem, it would just allow the consumer and businesses decide how they can help, in a manner that's best for them personally.",conservatives

and singh got the party wiped out in quebec. mulcair managed to hang on to solid base in quebec that could have been rebuilt. 

listen, no one knows quebec politics like mulcair. the guy lives it. does he know ontario or bc? no, and that was his weakness. without layton, toronto turned liberal red, as it did with singh. 

mulcair did the impossible in quebec. he was the first ot take a safe liberal seat for the ndp. he was laytopn's right-hand mand in quebec. 

i changed my vote from ndp to liberal strictly for strategic purposes. trudeau's momentum in ontario translated into more anti-harper votes in quebec.  mulcair's one mistake came in the debates when he went to the right of trudeau on deficits. that confused the base in ontario. bad mistake, but the fact is the ndp had no better leader. to offer.",liberals

left wing promises for immediate government aid are way easier to enunciate in a quick sound byte than a conservative explaining about market forces lifting all boats. left wing moral arguments for things like climate change and 'helping' people or groups appeal to people more than conservative statements about how nothing we do is going to impact climate change, or the benefits of self-reliance.

on top of that nearly half the population pays no income taxes anyway, so doesn't care what's being spent. and a quarter of the population will only vote for a guy from quebec, and the conservatives voter base is out west. not to mention the millions of public sector workers who have zero interest in a party which professes to want to cut government spending.

it looked *exactly* the same as late-stage socreds. because i that’s really what it was. preston manning was at that leadership convention that keegstra nearly won. he didn’t found reform until nearly 2 years after that.  by that time they had long ago dropped the pseudo-economics and were just parties of social conservatism and increasing power to the provinces (this happened under ernest manning in the 1950s who needed to get business leaders on his side and didn’t like the québécois)

 socreds were in government in alberta until 1971 and in government in b.c. until 1991. the “western alienation” message was key to their success and longevity as well as their ability to drop the nonsense economic theory. the preference of private monopolies was also a big thing in social credit because they liked being about to reward the “right sort” (aka social conservatives) monetarily",conservatives

there's also the perspective of the husband, with an unknown man in bed with his wife. that's a significant violation of personal space and no idea how you'd react, if violently. so would i - for example - prefer a golf club or a firearm to potentially defend myself? i'd lean to the firearm. of course, i'd have to unlock it and load it all the while you're probably stabbing me with a kitchen knife in the back.

attends un peu toi, *notre* gouvernement ? c’est une vision minoritaire au québec ça. on a principalement du fédéralisme de status quo au québec. donc c’est « le fédéral », pas « notre gouvernement ». et pour les souverainiste c’est soit « le fédéral » ou « le gouvernement d’occupation ».

et le canada ne sera pas détruit si le québec part. c’est le deuxième argument fédéraliste le plus riducule après « les rocheuses ».

tu ne trouves pas que tes positions sont un peu contradictoires ? d’un côté tu critiques l’existence d’un parti souverainiste à ottawa, et de l’autre tu ne veux pas que les souverainistes aillent dans les autres partis. tu ne peux pas avoir le beurre et l’argent du beurre.

&gt; à propos, je me demande toujours où en on serait si la position du niqab aurait été différente ou au moins, plus nuancée. le npd a eu du mal a décider comment se positionner là dessus. dans un monde alternatif où mulcair se positionne avec plus d'élégance, devient pm...malgré ses opinions personnelles, j'ai l'impression que les médias et politiciens anglophones seraient plus en mesure de débattre des questions controversées à la place de faire des hyperboles anti-laïcité et pro exceptions religieuses. comme avant.

exactement à la même place. le npd de 2015 au québec était un château de cartes qui tenait sur la popularité de jack layton uniquement. on ne me fera pas croire que le québec a déserté le npd pour sa position sur le niqab pour aller rejoindre un autre parti avec la même position. si le ndp n’en avait pas fait son cheval de combat, il serait tombé par quelque chose d’autre.

tout ce que le npd avait besoin de faire en 2015 était de prouver qu’il était toujours le parti de jack. il a fait le contraire. il mérite amplement sa défaite.",liberals

c'est duceppe qui dit tout le temps que la plupart des candidats comptent 5% dans la considération des gens lors du vote. surtout si c'est en ville et dans une plus grosse province. rarement, des candidats plus vedettes peuvent compter un peu plus dans la balance et je vois que ça a été le cas avec nantel, qui avait déjà fait ses preuves pendant 8 ans. 

c'est à peu près ça que je me disais. le performance globale du bloc a beaucoup compté. il y a eu un moment où hébert/plc paraissait gagnant, mais ça s'est évaporé assez vite il me semble. c'est intéressant de constater que l'arrogance d'hébert lui a coûté très probablement sa chance au siège, merci pour cet éclaircissement. avec juste 4% entre trudel et hébert, l'attitude et l'absence en terrain a dû faire une différence. en tout cas, c'est sa faute, il ne peut que se blâmer lui-même. 

je me demande si la dégringolade du npd aidait plus le plc ou le bloc. dans sherbrooke et hochelaga, il y a eu des course serrées à trois, mais le plc l'a emporté quand même. ailleurs, l'effondrement du npd a donné des victoires nettes au bloc. je ne connais pas tant longueuil, mais mon impression était que cette circonscription ressemble plus à sherbrooke et hochelaga et qu'avec une meilleure candidature npd, ça aurait été une course à trois plutôt qu'à deux. avec trois bons candidats et bon travaux de terrain, je ne sais pas lequel des trois partis aurait gagné. mais bon. on verra ce qui se passe la prochaine fois. ça risque d'être une course à deux si le npd continue de niaiser avec les candidatures.",liberals

so is the federal government going to make an equivalent federal cap that still leaves room for emissions increase? will their cap be closer to current emissions to further reduce potential future emissions growth?

if it's the former, i sure hope they include some sort of enforcement mechanisms. because if they create their own cap that's equivalent to alberta's cap, but doesn't come with strict enforcement, then this whole thing would be hollow words from the liberals, set up so they have announceables. if it has enforcement though, or if it's lower than alberta's cap, then we can actually get something serious out of this",liberals

according to who? you? scientists? which ones? what are their names? where did they get their degrees? in what specific subfields? what research process did they follow? can you explain to me, on a chemical level, why ivermectin does not kill covid-19? can you explain on a chemical level what it does to the human body? no? that's fine, neither can i. but here's a newsflash. i don't trust anybody who wants to say, \"hey, this isn't true. it should be illegal to say this, because it's not true.\" you know why i don't trust it? because i don't know who's making that call. i doubt it's justin trudeau. i doubt he could tell me why ivermectin doesn't work. maybe those scientists could. wait - those same scientists spent a whole month telling me masks don't work. maybe, i dunno, they shouldn't be put in charge of making it illegal to contradict them? because they're not perfect? and facts change? 

again, can you actually justify the fact that under this law it would have been illegal for the entire first month of the pandemic to say online that masks protected you from covid? because to me, that's fucking unjustifiable. that's *one example* of a way that this law would have utterly failed to stop the spread of misinformation, so severely that it would have *helped* the spread of misinformation more than any online troll ever could, because it would have made it *illegal* to say something that we now know to be true.",liberals

h7lbubz,2021-08-03T05:58:53.000-07:00,"after sixty years, canada’s new democratic party faces a make-or-break choice i think the bc ndp has also been excellent on climate policy - resuming increases to the provincial carbon tax, which christy clark had frozen at $30/t, and launching the cleanbc plan, which emphasizes transport (a zero-emission vehicle mandate rising to 10% in 2030 and 100% in 2040) and buildings (electric heat pumps).

and of course on covid, bc has done better than any of the provinces outside the atlantic. the government let dr. bonnie henry take the lead, and accepted the findings of the bc cdc that extending the vaccine interval up to 16 weeks would be effective.

on housing, besides raising the foreign buyer surtax and bringing in the speculation and vacancy tax (which includes interesting measures aimed at increasing property tax for satellite families), the bc ndp government also set up the land ownership transparency registry. the next question is whether they'll follow the recommendations of the macphail report and override supply-side bottlenecks at the municipal level.

having the provincial and federal governments in alignment has been very helpful in getting federal funding for bc priorities - skytrain expansion, child care, non-profit housing, temporary modular housing.

as a federal liberal, i think the major decisions the bc ndp government made which i disagree with were (a) attempting to obstruct tmx, a key part of the national-unity deal (with an ndp government!) to get climate policy in alberta, which resulted in kinder morgan getting cold feet and trudeau buying it to keep it alive; (b) tightening rent control (now inflation plus zero) when there's a chronic shortage of housing and market rents are 20% above controlled rents, which is only going to aggravate the gap and push out anyone who needs to find housing (who can pay an extra 20% overnight?).",liberals

to be honest there's a good chance he'll stay on and be given a second chance even if he loses. a lot will depend on how it goes. it is very hard to do exceptionally well in your first campaign, conservatives have always understood that sometimes with a little experience you can do much better the second time. so if he puts on a good show and falls short they may well say 'one more time'.

also it's weird how you're talking about the tyranny of the majority when we've been in a minority government since 2019. the minority has as much power as they can possibly have. if anything, sometimes they have more power and leverage than the party in power under certain circumstances.

under any other circumstances lockdowns would not be legal but we're in a deadly pandemic and obviously under these extraordinary circumstances we can suspend some freedoms, as is outlined in the *very same charter*. also why use the word \"smugly\"? you act as if trudeau and his super majority government is on tv twirling his evil mustache and \"smugly\" proclaiming to be emperor of canada. 

it's also honestly pretty baffling how you're making these arguments now especially when we're in our worst wave yet. if the pandemic was dying down then okay, but the timing of this is absolutely ridiculous and absurd. as are the rest of your arguments. you seem to have some sort of victim complex where you think you're being oppressed by the government when you aren't. i can't even imagine how you'd actually feel living under an actual authoritarian government.",liberals

the 2021 green platform was virtually indistinguishable from the ndp one, save for very minor differences. climate change is no longer a niche issue that the other parties won't address, and the greens' proposals are very similar to the ndp's. we have a system that shafts smaller parties (yes, fptp bad, but it's unlikely to change anytime soon so political parties should be mindful of that). it seems to me that pushing for more aggressive climate action within the existing parties, even the conservatives, would have more of an impact than having this frankenstein fifth party that can't do anything.",conservatives

for example, ever wonder what happened to the francophones who used to be the majority in the west? anglophones worked to deny them access to french language schooling in a (largely successful) attempt to drive them out or assimilate them. french language rights were systemically stripped as part of the program of protestant sectarian bigotry. 

similar attempts actually went further and carried on longer in new brunswick, where orangist mayors of places like moncton worked to try to deny basic services in french as a way to force assimilation through marginalization. this continued well into the 1960's and 1970's.

not that it makes that better or justified. just making it a more clear distinction between saying \"canada\" was anti-french. because if anything, other than in quebec itself, the federal government was the only other real place they could defend themselves.

it wasn't too long ago that there were pro-life/anti-lgbt mps within the liberal party as they held that rural caucus. as the liberals are a more pure brokerage party, they were fine with these contradictions within the party. pm justin trudeau made a conscious effort to appear more left wing to appeal to voters compared to the positions held by martin/chretien. so their positions have appealed more to educated people because of it.",liberals
