while it's reasonable to be concerned about long term impacts, such concerns should also be grounded in evidence. given what we know about the delivery mechanisms used in these vaccines, immunology, and human biology, there are not many vectors for long-term impacts that wouldn't be reflected relatively quickly. mrna for example is out of the body within hours; that's well understood, and the role of mrna in human cellular interaction is well understood. it's of course always possible that all of the previous knowledge is missing something; but that doesn't mean it's **likely**. so concerns about long-term impacts should be tempered by the available evidence which indicates that vectors for creating long-term impacts are limited.",conservatives

no, that's not what the graph represents. it represents federal corporate tax revenues a as a percentage of gdp compared to the effective corporate tax rate. other government taxes are not mentioned or included on the graph. that graph only pertains to corporate tax rates and corporate tax revenue. i'm not sure where you're conclusion here is coming from since you seem to have misread the graph.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;also the effect of the drop in corporate rates is going to have a delayed effect and theres evidence that there was a great loss in potential revenue

there's no evidence of this. corporate tax revenue has remained steady in canada for three decades despite three decades of reductions.

&gt;why are the democrats in the saltates going to raise the corporate tax?

because the corporate tax is ideologically held up as a processive tax. the doesn't neceiiserally mean the corporate taxes effects are progressive. there's plenty of literature, empirical evidence and hard data that shows that they're both fairly ineffective as a revenue tool and that workers bear a percentage of the burden.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;your whole argument hinges on this : somehow you think capital and investment, which are tax deferring/deductible assets, have something to do with a “taxes on those assets” what taxes apply to them? it seems youre saying that corporate taxes are based (1) on the assets the company has and (2).......nope, i guess thats it. corporate taxes are based on profits - so any capital and investment expenditures are tax deductible - so you buy a new truck - those costs go into expenditures. subtract expenditures from revenue, and voila! profits. so a tax on profits is not at all a tax on assets. thats what sales tax, property tax are. taxes on assets.

this is basically all nonsensical rambling.

&gt;by the way, if corporate taxes depress wages, then i would think the opposite to be true, that lowering corp taxes ended up increasing wages. did that happen? no f-ing way.

a corporate tax collects revenue equivalent to $50 billion in 2019/2020. if $50 billion dollars was divided equally amongst canada's workforce it would be a difference of around $2,000 per capita if divided equally between the country's workforce while  around 20-70% of that would be  the amount that comes out of workers pockets. the overall effect on corporate taxes on wages is marginal, but it's effects on labor are still regressive. it's the same in regard to wealth taxes. instead of generating revenue, they tend to marginally reduce it by a negligible amount. this can easily be offset by other taxes, but neither corporate or wealth taxes actually generate significant revenue for the jurisdictions they're imposed in.

in terms of wages, other factors play a larger role in them, but the corporate taxes effect is regressive since it depresses wages.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;that only happened through minimum wage increases by law.

minimum wage tends to have a fairly marginal impact on poverty reductions and improvement of living standards. direct government transfers to low income individuals and households tends to be a more effective welfare tool.

though if your argument is that wage growth only occurs as a result of minimum wage, that tends to ignore global wage growth trends over the past century. minimum wages can have a positive impact on overall wages, but they're not the driving force of wage growth.",conservatives

but imo when you classify crime as gun violence and then every other crime you are going to be bound miss the battle anyways. it really should be categorized as violent crimes and non-violent crimes, it shouldn’t matter if the person used a gun, knife, car, bomb, or a cruise missile. you need to get to the root of the problem (gang, mental health, social, economic, etc) and stop blaming the inanimate object and start dealing with the underlying causes.

&gt; he did so because it was the 50th anniversary of the october crisis. he didn't just come up with that randomly. pierre trudeau had a significant role in a lot of other matters, should we avoid criticizing or denouncing some of it because his son is now the prime minister?

no, and trudeau *fils* has never indicated as such, including even with the present debate over statues of canadian public officials. the issue was the aggressive and very personal manner in which blanchet and the bloc framed the discussion, rather than the matter itself. he quite clearly was riding the coattails of what the ndp and cpc were doing with the other members of the trudeau family.",liberals

i fo have to caution against the author's implicit claim that having progressive government \"for a good time\" is always better than having it \"for a long time.\" barrent was in government for 3 years and the ndp didn't take power again in bc for another 15. sure, the soccreds didn't privatize icbc or abolish the alr, but they did do a lot of bad. the austerity of the mid 80s comes top of mind. perhaps, a slightly less ambitious, but more popular ndp could have prevented that. just a thought. and let's not forget, just because an institution is effective or power doesn't mean a right-wing government won't try to destroy it. the bc liberals nearly bankrupted bc hydro with terrible private run-of-river contracts, nearly did the same with icbc by treating it like a piggy bank, and implemented several changes to limit the alr's power (now reversed by the horgan government). just food for thought.",liberals

ha074ra,2021-08-22T16:55:56.000-07:00,"twitter marks justin trudeau’s social media post attacking erin o’toole as ‘manipulated media’ this is incorrect.

there will always be a demand for private services, by those willing to pay for them.

these individuals will still pay their taxes, and those taxes will still end up funding the public system. what they won't be doing is taking up a spot that a poor person needs to get treatment. that's where the europeans have us beat.

there are less people using and clogging up the public system, leading to shorter wait times, more available beds, more available doctors and nurses, and a better overall result for the population as a whole. 

currently our wait times are miserable,  and people do die while waiting for treatment, or they are suffering while waiting for treatment.

to put this another way, and going back to public school versus private school, if we banned private schools and tossed all those kids in private schools into public schools  would we have a better education system?

no! we would have overflowing classrooms, overworked teachers, crowded schools and school buses and worse outcomes. the private school system takes some strain off the public schools. the same would happen for healthcare.

the wealthy and well off would get the treatment they want and are willing to pay for opening up spaces for those who cannot afford it to get quicker treatment.

and these are the europeans we are talking about, they are more socialist than canada generally, they don't sit around and let people due  they don't underfunded their public healthcare, they have some of the best health care systems on the planet. why? two tier.

again, there are two outliers, canada and the usa. both canada and the usa are single system healthcare and both are mediocre. the europeans are two tier and have some of the best in the world.  why not emulate the best?",liberals

this is no different than when the liberal government refused to invoke the emergency act to force a uniform response to the pandemic, even after it became clear that more than a few provincial governments were failing to act (alb, sask included). i would argue it would have been the *right thing* to do ethically, at least superficially, it would have saved lives, but it would have also resulted in open revolt by the provinces.

so what exactly are the feds supposed to do against a bill supported- or at least not opposed- by a majority of quebecois? piss away a decade worth of political goodwill to make a doomed court challenge and force quebec to invoke the notwithstanding clause? aside from handing the conservatives the next election, what would that accomplish?",conservatives

everything is on demand, and there is no limited \"airwaves\".  people will watch what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.

if it is about production, why is youtube or spotify or any pure streaming company that is only a distributor, and not a producer,  being caught up in this?  they don't make their own content (youtube did but like google often does they abandoned it).

no streamer in the music space is a producer, spotify's competitive advantage is its recommendation algorithm.  that's gone if the discover weekly playlist and daily mix playlists are forced to put 30% canadian content as the radio is forced to do.

it's also important to note, with both youtube and on music streaming, anybody can get their content on the service.  their is no upfront payment to the creator, they have to chose to put their content on the service.  payment is based on streams.  so with these services, just making content and getting it on a service does an artist no good, it needs to actually be watched/listened to, to be remunerated, and no legislation can force that.

netflix, prime, disney+, hbomax are both distributors and content producers...  why should their distribution arm fund the competition (other productions) of their production arms?  especially something like disney or hbo where they aren't going to carry their own non-branded stuff.    if it is not an hbo and disney production, they aren't going to carry it.

the broad-tent services are fragmenting as distribution rights expire.  more and more companies are going direct with their content...  cutting out the middle-men, which bell and rogers, and corus are.  which means (at least in english canada) bell had better do a lot more content production if it wants to compete when the rights to all of its us stuff expires and is not renewed.  crave can become the letterkenny streaming service...

and to that end, as more and more services start to carry just their own stuff, who carries this cancon that is being funded?  its one thing to pay into a fund to help make it, its another to force them to license it and carry it when its not made by them.

we are going to pay for a bunch of content that no one wants or watches...  why?",liberals

when reddit changed its rules to ban \"hate speech\", they specifically exempted hate directed at a \"majority group\":

&gt;while the rule on hate protects such [minority] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. for example, the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.

however, all of that is a moot point if the provinces can't figure out how to adminster fast enough.

last check we were barely at 35% of delivered doses having been administered. ontario was barely at the 32% mark.

and lmao, from your own link.   you linked a story that is saying \"canada near head of line for moderna\" because it had o'toole repeated the same bullshit talking point.

here, from your very own link:

&gt;the chairman of american vaccine maker moderna told the cbc on sunday that canada is near the front of the line to receive 20 million doses of the covid-19 vaccine it preordered.  
&gt;  
&gt;noubar afeyan was asked on cbc’s *rosemary barton live* whether the fact that canada committed to prepurchase its doses before other jurisdictions means it will get its supply first. dr. afeyan confirmed that was the case.  
&gt;  
&gt;“the people who are willing to move early on with even less proof of the efficacy have assured the amount of supply they were willing to sign up to,” he said.
