but the existence of those natural boundaries without a mechanism to utilize them in crisis would be a shame.

there’s no reason a unitary federal government couldn’t make use of those natural boundaries though. i suspect if the federal government had full jurisdiction, stricter internal measures would have been adopted earlier and the virus would have been controlled better nationally - although it still kept managing to slip through the cracks internationally. it took way too long to institute the half measure that was the short term hotel quarantine.

however: let me put this hypothetical out there as a reason for the continued existence of provincial governments. would a scheer government, without provincial governing opposition, have been better or worse nationally? in particular for those places that weathered the storm well?

the answer is an overwhelming no.

yes, and therein lies the issue.

it puts lgbt equality on the list of topics that are still considered acceptable discourse, issues that are still up for debate. as much as people love to furiously crank off to this idealized, \"anything goes\" form of free speech, we as a society have pretty clearly decided there are some topics that are utterly unacceptable to have debates on and should be shut down at the first opportunity. i dare say you wouldn't see \"well, they're just speaking their mind :)\" if the topic in question were, say, \"i think canada should do a genocide, just like, for funsies\". that's obviously a rather extreme example, but there's extremely good reasons why many people refuse to even entertain the idea of a leader who thinks whether or not they're human is a topic that should be up for discussion.",conservatives

when it comes to the federal vote on bills pertaining to lgbtq rights the record is unambiguous. conservative parties have *consistently* opposed bills that support and/or enshrine lgbtq persons with the same rights, freedoms and protections as their fellow canadians.


bill c-33, majority opposed by conservatives, affirmed by all other parties. 


bill c-38, majority opposed by conservatives, affirmed by all other parties. 


bill c-250, majority opposed by conservatives, affirmed by all other parties. 


bill c-16, majority opposed by conservatives, affirmed by all other parties.


bill c-6, majority opposed by conservatives, affirmed by all other parties.


let me be clear, ***all*** attempts to ratify lgbtq persons with the same rights, freedoms and protections as the rest of canadians have been opposed by conservative parties. that record speaks for itself. 



[conservative voters are consistently polled as less tolerant over a spectrum of lgbtq issues](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tim.renshaw#!/vizhome/lgbtpart2/story1). this is about as banal of a fact as we get, anti-lgbtq persons are more likely to support the conservative party and there's a reason for that.  


[candidates and veteran mps are among the conservatives who have spoken against the right and freedoms of lgbtq canadians](https://pressprogress.ca/8-conservative-candidates-who-made-disturbing-homophobic-statements-and-promoted-anti-lgbtq-hate/).      


when it comes to anti-lgbtq statements we can rely on one party (the cpc) above all others, to produce candidates and members of parliament who take vocal stances against their fellow canadians. 


again, it is an utterly banal fact that federal and provincial conservative parties are routinely and consistently the majority opposition to lgbtq rights and freedoms. this is not a controversial statement, it is a factual one.



o'toole can say he's \"pro gay rights\" until he's blue in the face. is he attending pride parades? nope. he can't even make the most basic of meaningless pandering moves. he certainly cannot whip the party into showing support where it means something, the vote.

besides, there's cultural context for all kinds of incredibly shitty laws, and those who stood up to them throughout history are our modern day heroes. churchill, mandela, gandhi, mlk, and on.  

what the article you quote at length boils down to is \"we can't call them out for being racist, because they're just going to get mad at us and be more racist.\" this is obviously stupid and is no way to create change. the worst conflicts in history all have this basic logic of appeasement and avoidance in the lead-up. it's naive, it's cowardly, and it gives license to do worse because there's no consequences. 

in the end, either quebec separates because the society they are trying to construct has diverged too far from canada's values, which is the obvious intent of this law, and bill 101. or it doesn't, because quebecois see being part of canada as worth the price of some cultural homogeneity. either outcome is preferable to me over a canada that lets some parts discriminate because they're special.",liberals

she goes on to describe a woman who, after an extended period of depression, \"reached a point in her life where she did not want to continue with her lesbian activity\", who then apparently found a counsellor to help her, and retains a positive view of the service rendered.

i think her accusation of hypocrisy is that the bill would supposedly permit affirmative counselling while banning people like that woman from being supported in her desire to no longer engage in \"lesbian activity\". which is entirely nonsense, because it draws a false equivalence between actual therapy and telling people they are sinful and unclean for merely existing.

and unless canada is also working to reduce our emissions, (which a a price on carbon does, and doesn't put anyone into poverty), our lobbying will be ignored as \"do what i say, not what i do.\"

&gt;  naive, uninformed, and idealistic.

that feels like you meant it as an insult, but being in my 40's i'll take that as a compliment, except for the uninformed bit. you're wrong there.

&gt; we are already seeing a housing crisis. 

which has nothing to do with a price on carbon.

&gt; i explained very clearly how the carbon tax will fuck canadians over, and do absolutely nothing to stop climate change.

and the experts say that you're wrong, and i see no reason to disagree with them.

&gt; hooooly craaaap the fact that you think this money is free is exhaustingly, disgustingly naive. 

if you spend less on carbon than the national average, it is. and i think plenty of people are thankful for how you are contributing to their bank balances.

&gt;  who do you think should spend your money? you? or the federal government?

me of course. not sure why you're bringing this up, as the feds don't spend my money, they spend crown funds, which come, in part from my money, but isn't mine anymore. if you don't like the government controlling how you spend money, then o'toole's plan, is pretty messed up.

&gt; those “subsidies” absolutely do not cover the extra cost of living

they're intended to attempt to mitigate the extra costs, while still providing an incentive for getting off carbon, so sounds like they're pegged properly.

&gt; no they aren’t as profitable, or efficient! convenience is irrelevant. 

that's wrong. evs are way more efficient than ic vehicles, it's simple physics. a large electrical generating plant, can make much more efficient use of fuel compared to umpteen small engines. the fact that ic vehicles and their fueling sources dominate the market is a massive factor in why they are still on the road. people like what they like, and get too wrapped up in not being able to stop at a gas station every 10km.

&gt; like literally everythingwill go up, including housing.

unless it's green, and then people will buy it up, because it'll be cheaper.

&gt; there is no green alternative to this manufacturing.

if you mean as in, almost no one is using green alternatives, yes. if you mean there is no way to do this and reduce carbon emissions, you're wrong. transport and power production are the two most obvious realms carbon emissions can be massively reduced.

&gt; what, you expect poor people living in trailers or on a res to buy a fucking new 80 thousand dollar tesla to go green? are you stoned?

no, there are plenty of cheaper ev options out there, and as the second hand market grows, it will just get better, even without government incentives.

admittedly it will probably matter more to the former group than the latter but this really does feel like the tories are trying to get out from a line of attack that they honestly probably would have been better off just taking on the chin. 

the next question is if bernier and the ppc jump on this and promise the overturn the 2020 oic or even as far as liberalizing the firearms act. sure centrists would hate it but they weren't going to vote ppc anyway. it fits in with their libertarian bent as well so it's not like it would be a massive about-face.

oh dear, was that metaphor? ok, let me make it clear. you started by saying that people are being \"forced\" to take a vaccine (which is obviously not true). then, you shifted your position a bit and said they're only being forced to limit their social interactions because of their decision. a little bit easier to prove, but harder to defend....

pm trudeau sr. (w/ chretien as minister) suggested 2 (with a bit of 1) with the 1969 'statement of the government of canada on indian policy' (maligned as the white paper). and the backlash to this led to a counter paper representing option 3, called \"citizen's plus\" suggesting that natives in canada be treated as citizens with special racial privileges.

policy since then has fallen hard to option 3 and of course option 4. recent pieces like undrip and trc fall deeply into option 3. either of which would end canada if blindly implemented.

i suspect we'll try to do option 3 too far and either there will be massive backlash and the public blame will fall on natives, resulting in a huge spike in racism .... which is hardly fair since natives don't control the government.

we got a small taste of this with the rail protests over wetsuweten in ontario. natives protested which is fine and then they turned illegal, less fine. but then due to option 3, the opp by policy is not allowed to stop native protests, legal or not. so the protests were highly destructive .... and then you saw a rise in anti-native racism. same with caledonia a few years earlier. and in both cases, by option 3, the protestors got what they wanted (and more) ... which serves to encourage future similar events. nvm rewarded, in wetsuweten the unelected chiefs supporting illegal protest got to meet with the pm and were effectively promised ownership of a piece of land the size of southern ontario.

the whole thing is so predictable and stupid.",liberals

aerospace tech advanced mostly because of government funded research, and continues to be the case.musk was able to fund spacex with the help of government contracts and funding. the reusable rocket was tried back in the day, but material science hadn't advanced sufficiently for them to build it like musk doggedly ended up doing. most of what private aerospace companies do is commercialization, which is not nearly as innovative as creating things from scratch. 
as for lack of innovation, that's because governments do such a terrible job when it comes to advertising it's innovations. darpa alone created the non-commercial predecessors of the internet, gps, drones and the personal computer. the job of the government isn't to make profits, it is to create the infrastructure necessary for private corporations to create profit, with the unspoken hope that private corporations will then pay the government back for the government's work in the form of taxes. the british government similarly helped babbage fund the development of what would become the computer, and were the first to recognize the potential of radar. 
companies like bombardier and boeing won't be allowed to go bankrupt because they're too important for their respective countries. if that's the case, it is only fair that the government insist that if they are going to she'll put money for these companies, they should be owned (in part) by them, at least until the companies can buy their shares back. i'm not saying it's going to be easy to continue to fund government companies, but let's not pretend that there aren't good reasons for doing so.",liberals

when they they have insane parents who push them to be lgbt just the same as when they have insane parents who push them to follow a religion.

i would say in this privilege centered world of leftists, not being part of a minority group means you have less privileges.

&gt;so of course there is no need for posters to tell you it is okay to be straight.

the only reason needed for such posters is the self esteem of children.  do straight children not need boosts to their self esteem?  do they not need validation?  because they're not a minority?

&gt;you're either honestly ignorant about the level of bullying and self-hatred gays went through when they were in school, or just a dishonest guy who thinks we all have amnesia and forgot what it is really like being gay in school.

everyone in school experienced bullying and peer pressure.  not just gay people.  not just minorities.  if youre short, if you're poor, if you're a nerd.  you're not fucking special because of who you want to fuck or because you're manipulated into mutilating your body.  as far as im concerned a lot of gay rights activism is based on jusse smollett type lies propagated in news media throughout the last half century.",liberals

hnnt5g8,2021-12-07T08:43:08.000-08:00,"ndp mp rachel blaney introduces right to housing bill &gt; north island-powell river mp rachel blaney took a step towards ensuring people in canada have the right to appropriate and affordable housing.


uhhh...no? she literally just proposed declaring something and then doing nothing to make it happen.

&gt; “ensure that the right to housing is firmly recognized as law. it would redefine the federal framework for housing legislation and would set a requirement for the minister of justice to ensure every regulation change is consistent with the right.”

did our housing crisis start because of a regulation change? no, we experiencing a combination of structural factors which must be addressed through hard work, such as \"actually building houses\"

&gt; “the liberals have agreed in their national housing strategy that housing is a basic human right, but we’re not seeing any action or accountability in our communities where it matters,” said blaney. “putting it in the bill of rights sets a requirement, and allows laws to be challenged in court if they are failing to meet that requirement.”

since when are the courts in a position to regulate the economy? are they going to outlaw supply and demand? 

if this were a law which stipulated that *the government guarantees to provide a house for every canadian*, then that would be different but this mp doesn't choose to go that far. she wants the government to be legally responsible to enforce her ideological priorities through the courts and through regulation yet she isn't willing to go one step further and actually propose a functioning universal housing program.

they will just do absolutely anything to solve the lack of housing crisis besides actually building houses

\"maybe rent control will force landlords to build cheap new houses?\" nope.

\"maybe investment restrictions will force developers to build cheap new houses?\" nope

\"maybe we can just pass a law that says 'everyone gets a house' and it will magically happen?\". no!!

this is all so ideological. it's more about an anti-capitalist crusade than about actually solving the housing crisis.",liberals

&gt;in 2014 liberal leader justin trudeau expelled all senators from the liberal caucus and, as prime minister in 2016, created the independent advisory board for senate appointments,[14] both of which were attempts to make the senate less partisan without requiring constitutional change.[12] members of the board include members from each jurisdiction where there is a vacancy.[15] the prime minister is not bound to accept the board's recommendation.[16] some provinces refused to participate, stating that it would make the situation worse by lending the senate some legitimacy.[17] since this new appointments process was launched in 2016, 52 new senators, all selected under this procedure, were appointed to fill vacancies. all canadians may now apply directly for a senate appointment at any time, or nominate someone they believe meets the merit criteria.[18]

also true, but if we are going the whole way, the senate basically has no real influence at all. if the senate was to attempt to overrule the lower house there would be a huge stink. i cannot recall the last time the senate actually did override the lower house. they have asked for changes, but i cannot recall them, in recent history, fully rejecting a bill.",liberals

hi1bnia,2021-10-25T07:29:58.000-07:00,"three more mps say they're running in house speaker’s election i think the bloc won’t put up a speaker because the image they want to project above all else is fighting for quebec interests and avoid weighing in on issues that aren’t relevant to quebec, which would be hard to do if you’re supposed to be an impartial speaker who is supposed to show balance with mps from other regions and parties, which i suspect would be more unpopular in the bloc’s circles than elsewhere. assistant speakers are also expected to tone down the partisanship and speak on less contentious issues when in the house while the speaker is on duty.

normally the speaker position has electoral benefits that can be communicated to constituents about holding parliament to account, but i think it plays less well for the bloc electorally since the impartiality of the position is in conflict with their brand.

i suspect godin will attract the bloc vote as a quebec mp, since they would probably choose him over mendes as a way to vote against the government (she also doesn’t have a strong reputation as speaker, granted she’s also very inexperienced compared to rota and hughes.

that said it would be nice if the only woman speaker we had wasn’t 40 years ago, so i also hope hughes gets it since she’s been assistant speaker for a while now. i suspect it will go to rota though, unless something funky happens with the vote split leading to godin.

also an interesting tidbit is that the vote for speaker is actually a ranked ballot.

edit: just to add, rota was an upset for speaker in the previous parliament, as geoff regan was the liberal incumbent. with the ranked ballot system, the liberals were likely comfortable putting rota and regan in their top 2 without all of them having regan as their first pick, so if the liberals were more relaxed on their top picks with the ranked system, in theory a single opposition party like the cpc could disrupt the vote by putting all their weight behind rota.",liberals
