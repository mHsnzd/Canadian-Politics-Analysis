more practically, most people involved in these deaths are themselves dead. so punishment should be directed at the institutions that participated: parliament, the rcmp, and the catholic, united, and anglican churches. i don't know what punishment is appropriate there - one assumes dissolution in disgrace for the rcmp and seizure of church property for reparations. we'd have to come up with something for parliament - the thing many first nations want is the land back, i expect we could find a solution along those lines.",liberals

i think this bill is problematic, but i don't think it has anything to do with censorship.

for starters, it's the crtc.  that's all this law does, is try to give the crtc power over internet streaming video like they have over broadcast video.

that means it doesn't apply to text.  so it seems an odd way to censor the masses by only controlling video, and only on major streaming sites, but not what they type or say on sites like facebook.  so that's the first clue it's not about censorship.

the second clue is that the [government already can and does censor people, and even put people in jail, for spreading hate speech on the internet, even on their own personal websites.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech_laws_in_canada#r_v_presseault_\\(2007\\))  it would seem redundant to also give that power to the crtc, but again only for video, and only to fine people, when the government already has the power to arrest people for things said anywhere on the internet.

the third clue is who is behind the bill - bell, rogers, and global.  the owners of canadian media companies like ctv, cfmt, and... global.  tv channels that pay for old american television shows, syndicate them, and run them on tv for ads.

they're terrified of this [new type of youtube channel,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucraadf42hzcthaorbbduivw/videos) one that doesn't produce any original content, it just legally licenses old tv shows and runs them online to make money off the ads - the exact same business model as ctv, cfmt and global, but without any of the crtc's \"minimum canadian content\" rules, giving them a leg up on the competition.  

so while i do think there's some problems with this bill - namely, do we still need this \"minimum % canadian content\" rule?  is it even possible or realistic to enforce on the internet?  and why are we letting canadian media companies write laws that do not appear to benefit the average canadian as much as it benefits them?  

but i don't think this law is about giving the canadian government new powers to censor you on youtube.  they can already do that, and a lot more.",liberals

then, in 2040, some asshole will come around, say we don’t need the facility because we can buy vaccines on the world stage, and shut it down again. this kind of short sightedness has and continues to cost us dearly.

as for the covax, we aren’t doing anything wrong by getting vaccines through there. we have fronted a lot of money to covax, both to purchase vaccines for ourselves, but the other half of the money is to provide for other countries.

at this point we are contractually obligated to more vaccines then our entire population requires and the government has suggested we will donate the excess vaccines at the end. we had to secure 5x our population early to ensure that we got vaccines in a timely manner and because we weren’t sure which of them would succeed. nonetheless, the cost of acquiring so many was minimal compared to the cost of each day of the pandemic...

conservatives are constantly caught up with identity politics (they just don’t like it being called that).

liberal staffers / ministers usually come from higher level organizations in canada. they usually have extensive education credentials and work experience.

conservative staffers / ministers usually get their positions based on purity tests and a track record of towing the party ideology. 

take for example the education minister in ontario. he’s a thirty year old who has never gone to public school, has no education credentials, and no experience running a large organization. but because he passed the conservative purity test he was able to get a high level position.",conservatives

in this particular case, i think that both sides could be \"right,\" but ultimately to no avail.  the canada evidence act may apply to block the disclosure, but that may not bar parliament from ordering its release anyway under its inherent jurisdiction.

don't think of this as a dispute between the liberal party and parliament, think of it as a dispute between parliament (in its legislative capacity) and the crown (in its executive capacity).  that makes the issue clearer to me; parliament and the crown are having a fight about their relative powers.  it also tells me that the ultimate solution is political in nature, where parliament can either withdraw confidence in the government or exercise its inherent jurisdiction in ways that make the government's position untenable, e.g. by ordering the phac president be imprisoned until he produces the documents, or by censuring or expelling the minister of health for contempt of parliament.

if anything, accepting the court's jurisdiction on the matter is a dangerous thing for parliamentary privilege.  i haven't seen the speaker's arguments, but if rota (by way of representatives) is arguing on the merits rather than saying \"parliament has inherent jurisdiction and the courts may not interfere,\" he's weakening parliament's position.",liberals

not too long ago the federal government gave an official apology for how it treated lgbt public servants for their discriminatory practices and now these politicians prostrating themselves before quebec won't even acknowledge refusing to employ people who wear a religious symbols is discrimation. instead they are bending over backwards to say calling it discrimation is offensive.",liberals

&gt;it’s just 700 is a group made up of survivors of misconduct in the military who have been advocating for years about the need to address the problem. the group said in a series of tweets on monday that they want the committee wrapped up and a report tabled as soon as possible.  
&gt;  
&gt;“we have been consulted for years. these committees are becoming partisan and they shouldn’t be,” the group tweeted. “who knew what, and when, with regards to general vance is of secondary importance to the immediate needs of survivors.”

the pc and ndp have turned it into a circus to try and shame trudeau rather than actually thinking about what the purpose of the probe is.

from the same article:

&gt;“no one has taken responsibility and no one has apologized,” said ndp mp randall garrison.  
&gt;  
&gt;“until we get to the bottom of who knew what when, we have not concluded this study.”

this clearly shows how the probe is being used as a partisan weapon rather than sticking to it's purpose. the purpose of a probe isn't to get an apology out of someone - it's to collect information and evidence then submit recommendations for any follow up actions if any. the survivors' group mentioned above recognize this, unfortunately the cpc and ndp would rather get their headlines and soundbites rather than doing their jobs appropriately.",liberals

i have no idea if it would - likely the devil would be in the details here, i remain unconvinced that it is meaningfully possible to 'ban' a crime that hinges entirely on the intentions of a person making an otherwise quite legal medical decision. 

i cannot think of a way to effectively do this that would not impose undue burdens on people just trying to access necessary medical care - which i suspect is the entire point of the bill in the first place. note that your link includes this quote:

&gt; earlier this month, rajendra kale, editor-in-chief of the canadian medical journal (cmaj), suggested in an editorial that a fetus’s gender should not be revealed to expecting parents until after 30 weeks of pregnancy, in order to prevent female feticide.

it would seem that such a rule would accomplish all the goals of a 'ban' on sex-selective abortions, without needing to open the can of worms that is abortion regulation. we only have to look to the south to see how anti-abortion inclined governments use creeping regulations to try to make abortion more and more difficult to access until they've pushed it back underground again. i think awareness of this is why so many canadians are against any legislation dealing with that topic at all, perceiving it as a slippery slope.


you've linked a poll that is not only 11 years old, but one that i can't access the methodology for. it keeps returning inscruitable dns errors when i try to click the links to the pdf. so i have no idea what kinds of questions were asked to achieve the result recorded. 

but i'll turn it around for you - the conservatives were in power when this poll came and for years afterwards. if support for this ban was as widespread as you believe, why would they not have acted on it? i suspect that they believed, as i believe, that this kind of poll can produce illusory answers, people will agree to things in the context of a contentless poll that they would not agree to as legislation.

&gt; turns out a majority of canadians want a ban on sex selective abortion. this conservative bill is literally proposing a law that a majority of canadians want.

let's be honest. based on the evidence you've provided the most you can realistically claim is that 11 years ago a tiny majority of canadians said they wanted regulations to deal with sex-selective abortions. of course, if you asked them a whole bunch of vegetable questions, and then said \"do you think we should have a regulation to prevent farmers from crossbreeding a highly-addictive tomato/tobacco hybrid\", you'd probably get a majority response to that too. that doesn't tell you if the proposed law would address something that was a real problem or not.",conservatives

this is a complete strawman being perpetuated by quebec social media. nobody is saying that the attack in london was caused by bill 21. the claim is that bill 21 is the product of a larger problem of islamophobia that stretches across the board. the reason quebec has received a even the tiniest bit of attention on this (english newsstands aren't constantly selling papers with quebec on the front cover, despite what separatists think) is because of this very trend of federal politicians actively avoiding calling out intolerance in la belle province for electoral purposes.

again, no one is blaming quebec specifically for what happened in london, but your statement is indicative of a grander problem. ontario does have an introspective culture that places a value on tolerance and diversity (and i'm not even ontarian), which is why this london situation has garnered so much support. but as soon as the media or the politicians even attempt to address issues of systemic intolerance within the quebec system, they're immediately derided. saying that quebec should be more self-reflective and less overly-sensitive toward any kind of criticism isn't being anti-quebecer; if anything, it's being brave.",liberals

&gt;i'm not sure what you mean by this. i do research, others do too. so, as written, i'm afraid i don't agree. do you mean some people do that?

they absolutely don't. studies have shown on new topics it's repetition 100%. 

if you suddenly developed an interest in something like magic cards and wanted to know what the top deck for a new player is, you would look at a sub reddit and then accept the most common opinions. not necessarily looking further like researching meta decks on mtg goldfish etc... for new topics repetition = truth so letting false information repeat is a problem.

for topics like vaccines or covid, do many people know to look for primary sources like nature or pubmed? can they read a study and interpret data? often times it's no. so misinformation proliferates off the fact most peoples aren't equipped to evaluate quality.

&gt;the \"rub\" becomes who defines \"obvious disinformation\" or even what \"disinformation\" means. facebook thought it had a nice system that would remove only \"obvious\" stuff, and clearly they viewed themselves as making an error with hindsight. it's not clear to me why the government would do any better, or why the government would be able to do it with less bias. (for instance, do you have an example of \"disinformation\" that would be stopped that is primarily spread by the ndp or liberal supporters?)

i didn't propose the government would do it. only that there is value in moderating obvious lies.

you're asking if it misinformation is equal? it's much heavier on the right side.

antivax is present in all parties.

generally there are less things that openly incite violence. it's stuff like on the left side there is a common idea that housing prices are driven by outside things like developer greed, foriegn investors or investor greed and arguments about increasing supply don't play with that group as they want a specific villain and may not accept a market based explanation or a market based solution as some left wing groups don't believe in markets.

on the liberal side and the left it's arguments about guns. additional regulation won't reduce gun crime but gun crime is also not as significant for canada as it is for the us. but it sells well to specific demographics (urban and suburban moms) so it exists on platforms or is pushed occasionally after a violent event.

both these topics are harder to identify as specifically misinformation and their harm isn't that big. but identifying anti vax misinformation and flagging or moderating that would be helpful.",conservatives

it’s understandable that you might be confused about how government departments work. ministries and ministers’ titles tend to be a game of musical chairs and apples-to-apples with cabinet shuffles suffice to say, common. it’s the departments under them that are relatively static. the the department of employment and social development canada works with the department of finance canada to develop the formula. but finance minister deals with high level issues across the government not all of the nitty-gritty of all the policy thinking that goes behind every single line item in the budget. intergovernmental affairs only comes in on the back end to communicate the formula to the premiers. then the president of the treasury board cuts the cheques. 

read the constitution it’s not a negotiation. it’s a work product of looking at what canadians having “reasonably comparable levels” of taxation and services means. that “reasonably comparable” is what esdc looks at every single day and core to their mandate. esdc works very closely with finance on that formula.

esdc does the research-&gt;finance consumes the research and decides based on the research-&gt;iga transmits the decision—&gt;tbs enacts the decision 

so the formula really did *originate* with kenney! in fact, there is no one *living* who is **more** responsible for the current equalization formula than jason kenney (except perhaps stephen harper and justin trudeau “buck stops here” yada yada yada). it could be argued that freeland, morneau, oliver and the esdc ministers since kenney (duclos, qualtrough and hussen) are *equally* responsible since they didn’t redo kenney and flarhety’s work. but they’re not *more* responsible.  

also, the canada health and social transfer was broken into the canada health transfer and canada social transfer and then the cht was *taken away from* the esdc minister. mainly *so that* he could focus on the equalization formula.",liberals

h171vww,2021-06-09T06:08:17.000-07:00,"canada has an islamophobia problem — and conservatives are at the root of it related to this:

in 2014, jeff bennett ran for the pc party in the riding of london west.  yesterday, in the wake of the london attack, he posted this to facebook, on the subject of racism within his london supporters specifically but also canada in general, including a confession on his failure to confront the issue at the time:

https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story\\_fbid=10157931923491606&amp;id=532941605

&gt; \"boy are we happy to see you at our door this election\" 
&gt;
&gt; \"i can tell by looking at you that jeff bennett is a candidate i can support\"
&gt;
&gt; these are things people said to me when i was knocking on doors in london west as the pc party candidate in 2014. it happened many times. i would usually just thank them for their support and carry on. but it bothered me immensely. these people who'd never met me saw nothing special in me. they were happy only that my name was english and my skin was white. 
the pc party candidate in the election prior to me had been my friend ali chahbar. he had lost narrowly in a by-election only a year earlier. i remember thinking he'd win until i listened to a local talk radio show featuring callers concerned that ali's wife (a prominent local lawyer) was too vocal in her support of \"palestinian human rights\". as if that's a bad thing. the word \"sharia\" was tossed around. i remember screaming at the racist idiots calling in while sitting in the parking lot of a london coffee shop. 
&gt; 
&gt; i had volunteers on my campaign who told me they were happy to be able to contribute again. they \"had tried to volunteer a year earlier but the campaign office felt like the middle east\". i should have asked them to leave. i did not. when my friend ali came knocking on doors with me i was told to be selective which neighbourhood i chose to walk that day. i should have spoke up. again, i excused it as a few off the cuff remarks from a few well intentioned folks. \"they mean well. they just don't know any better.\"
now i see people expressing shock that a racist terrorist would drive his truck into the pathway of a muslim family going for a walk. \"london is better than this\" they say. \"i can't believe this happened here\". bullshit. i knocked on thousands of doors in the very neighbourhood this atrocity occured. this terrorist may have been alone in that truck on that day, but he was not acting alone. he was raised in a racist city that pretends it isn't.
&gt;
&gt; i drove past the scene yesterday. families wept while they laid flowers. i cried. i knew that ali chahbar's former campaign office is only 1km up the road. i knew that everyone would say this was a \"tragic\" and \"unthinkable\" event and many would consider it an isolated incident. condolences will pour in and people will demand the perpetrator face charges of terrorism. but this was neither \"unthinkable\" nor \"isolated\". its a daily reality minorities in this country face and i'm upset i have not done more to combat it. i'm partially to blame. i've come face to face with anti muslim attitudes in london ontario and said \"thank you for your support\". i'm so very sorry. i promise to do better. 
&gt;
&gt; it's not enough to fly flags at half mast and for politicians to send thoughts and prayers. we must take stock of the part we play. no more saying \"oh grandpa is not really racist. he was just raised differently\". well that \"differently\" is not okay. canada has a racist, unacceptable history. it's time we call it out, own it and take action.

another read on this is social conservatives think (and i'm not sure they're wrong) that politics is already so polarized that a more moderate, watered-down platform won't make it much more palatable.

if you're hoping for an upset win either way, you might as well run on what you actually believe. in 2006 there were probably enough liberal voters willing to consider the conservatives, so you could get them by going moderate. but is that still true in 2021? the religious right doesn't seem to think so - and if the choice is between \"probably going to lose on a moderate platform\" and \"probably going to lose on a true-believer platform\", you might as well go with the latter and hope for a fluke win.

gp9v8jx,2021-02-28T14:16:41.000-08:00,"adam radwanski: can canada-u.s. climate momentum survive a harder test ahead? the gist of it, for paywalled people:

trudeau and biden's first meeting included talk of joint climate action, including carbon border adjustments or carbon tariffs - taxes on imports from countries with less strict environmental laws, to level the playing field. it's a way to prevent our companies from being put at a disadvantage because other countries allow their companies to pollute.

the way it ideally works is every \"cooperative\" country imposes a carbon tax, and imports from everywhere else are taxed at the same rate so there's no debate: it's a fair system for everyone.

but the problem is that it's unlikely the us can get a carbon tax passed through their current congress. it's likely that president biden will have to use the powers of the presidency to create regulations as an alternative way to lower emissions. so there could potentially be challenges trying to estimate what these regulations are equivalent to in dollars per tonne, so you can set the tariff properly. that complexity means an opportunity for lobbyists to derail everything or make the tariff ineffective.

(constitutionally, this is a false argument, but they leaned hard into it.)

dion failed to capitalize on trying to counterspin the tory media blitz; his own video to the nation that ran after harper's came across as amateurish and haphazard and undermined his own support and confidence in the party. the lpc buckled, forced dion out of leadership, and anointed michael ignatieff as leader by acclamation (after convincing bob rae not to challenge him for leadership) and which point ignatieff unilaterally ruled out a coalition to replace harper and tore up the agreement.

covid has shown me that provinces already are more or less independent on most issues that matter - the only significant power the federal government has is money. manitoba, ontario, nova scotia, alberta, et al - they have guided this crisis.  the feds have sent money and personnel.

i frankly don't care if the quebecois call themselves a nation - because, frankly, they *are* a nation.  it's best that we accept this.  it's not a threat to confederation.  we don't need quebeckers to wave the canadian flag and celebrate on july 1st to have a working country.

it's also absurd to suggest quebec could separate without a referendum.

the law itself will have no serious effect on the french language.  it is a transparent attempt by premier legault to bait english canada into a nonsensical argument over what is obviously provincial jurisdiction - ie, education. english school rights are protected - for anglophones. the constitution guarantees nothing beyond that. the law won't really protect the french language, because francophones who go to english cegeps don't stop speaking french.  it will harm job prospects for francophones outside of quebec - but if young francophones have a problem with that, well, they should take it up with their elected representatives.

but of course, english canadians must always take the bait. legault knows we will - he banks on it, driving yet another wedge between quebec and english canada, cementing his power. i admit it's a smart move politically.

to be more precise herd immunity is when the rt value of a virus drops below 1, meaning the average infected person spreads the virus to fewer than one other person. but that value depends on behaviour. rt of the virus in early 2020 was like ~5.7. hard lockdowns bring it down, but it makes no sense to call that herd immunity unless we want to live like that forever.

you get the necessary immunity for herd immunity by calculating (rt-1)/rt. that's where the ~85% figures for covid came from in 2020. now you can probably figure we've changed behavior a little and ~70% or so is a reasonable target, but it's hard to say for sure until we actually go back to living like it's 2019.

sure, emissions have gone up: fact. and almost every single nation is capitalist since the fall of the berlin wall. except for north korea and cuba i guess, but even they have been dependent with china and russian. 

but that does not objectively prove that capitalism *caused* this and socialism *would not* have caused it. did emissions not go up in the soviet union during the 1900s? did they not go up under chinese communist rule under mao?

there is no doubt that there is waste with excess consumerism, but that does not necessarily mean that capitalism with market controls and regulations cannot be green, or even greener than socialism without the same processes and procedures.

this is a very hollow argument that socialists and social democrats claim, but has very little thought beyond “consumerism / capitalism bad “ 
this way of thinking is not “objectively true”

look at france or germany of the rest of the g7. the ndp criticizes that canadian emissions went up when the rest of the g7 went down. last time i checked, the g7 is made up of capitalist countries. so clearly emissions can go down under capitalism. 

what matters more than capitalism vs socialism when it comes to the environment are specific environmental policies. what do we do against acid rain? do we allow single us plastics? do we protect old growth forests? do we allow offshore drilling? what do we do about population growth? what do we do about  consumption of products with negative externalities? there will make much greater of a difference to the environment than government redistribution of wealth.",liberals

gru4mle,2021-03-22T03:59:15.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention they changed the name to climate change because dumbasses kept saying “if the globe is warming why did we get a bad snow storm!!!”
one of the potential consequences of climate change is europe getting much colder when the gulf stream gets disrupted, which would leave places like the uk having a climate closer to northern quebec.

the odds of disasters like this are debated, but are at least acknowledged as possible. facts like man-made climate change are settled fact and have been for decades. arguing against them is like debating the theory of evolution to a biologist.",conservatives

but back to the rifles, yes all of them by the liberals own legal wording are all civilian rifles, they literally lied and used the pandemic as an excuse to ignore facts and burn billions only because they got egg on their face for failing at covid response.

you mention i moved the goal post and yet you used the fallacy that just because jt only banned 9000 hunting rifles and shotguns there are other ones so it's ok to do the wrong thing, so which one of us is making it impossible for a discussion when only one of us is using facts on the matter? and it wasn't a small subset of rifles and shot guns banned, they banned thousands of different types from single shot to semi automatic with zero being assault rifles and zero being too dangerous for innocent people to own.",liberals

gru78m6,2021-03-22T04:18:27.000-07:00,"canada expects major surge in covid-19 vaccine deliveries this week, with over 2 million doses arriving i agree completely. i’m of the mind that *if* the liberals are actively working towards an election the absolute earliest they could possibly be planning for is somewhere near the end of the vaccine rollout. but even that seems extremely early when the most logical time for one is after tabling the first “post-covid” budget in the spring of 2022. that will be the time when they can present canadians with their vision of how they want to “build back better”, and either the opposition parties vote it down and trigger an election or they have the support of one party, likely the ndp, and the minority continues. 


it honestly doesn’t make any sense for them to trigger an election much earlier than that and all of the other chatter seems to just be nothing more than slagging trudeau.",liberals

gru8fbo,2021-03-22T04:27:15.000-07:00,"the case for a wealth tax in canada has never been clearer exactly, as an accountant, i can tell you that a wealth tax does not work. people who are asking for it need to understand that those super rich people are not sitting on cash. they have assets. if you want to tax them, they will have to sell their assets. this brings many problems; some assets are easy to sell, like stocks from a public company, while other assets will take more time and will need buyers, expensive houses and stocks from a private company. let us take for example a person who owns a major private corporation. if we decide to tax his wealth, which is mostly composed of stocks of his/her company, this person will need to sell their shares. this will dilute the control this person has over their company, and this dilution could threaten the future of this company.

now, the real problem to me are the people who are getting paid with options of shares of public traded companies. this is not an income tax course, so i will not spend time explaining everything and some of the exceptions, but the general rule is that they will be taxed on the gain of the option. let us say the company will give you x number of option with a strike price @$25, which is the value of the share at the moment you sign the contract, in 2 years and on the condition that you reach your objectives. after 2 years, when you receive your options, the shares now have a value of $50 each.  now as per the tax code, you will be taxed on the $25 of gains, but, and that's a big but, you have the rights to deduct 50% of that gain. that makes it taxed like a capital gain! that means if the ceo is making 5m of gains on his options, he is only paying tax on 2.5m! in the 2019 budget, the liberals said they will put a limit of ~200k on the deduction, but with covid they forgot about it...",liberals

wheres the source for 9000 types of rifles being banned?

as of may 1, 2020 the government of canada has prohibited over 1,500 models of assault-style firearms and certain components of some newly prohibited firearms (the upper receivers of m16, ar-10, ar-15, and m4 patterns of firearms). new maximum thresholds for muzzle energy (greater than 10,000 joules) and bore diameter (20 mm bore or greater) are also in place. any firearm that exceeds them is now prohibited
