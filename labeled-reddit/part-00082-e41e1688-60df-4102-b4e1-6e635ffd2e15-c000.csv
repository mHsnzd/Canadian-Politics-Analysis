h1g8xm6,2021-06-11T07:33:55.000-07:00,"ontario to recall legislature, invoke notwithstanding clause over ruling on election advertising first of all, this is not a democratic issue, its a rule of law issue. in fact, letting loose with s.33 is entirely democratic, as it gives full voice to the will of the electorate - consequences be damned. 

majoritarian abuse is a substantial danger of unrestricted democracy, which is why we had the charter in the first place. if anything, my modest proposal to let loose with s.33, which i hope you understand is made largely tongue in cheek, is hyper-democratic. 

second, you cannot have it both ways. 

either using s.33 is an outrage, and we should be outraged and force a real confrontation that could lead to a lasting peace by constitutional amendment, or it is a perfectly normal thing to use, and we should use it on the same footing as anyone else might. 

pretending that s.33 is only an outrage when used to protect minorities is bizarre self-flagellation that will get us nowhere. 

judging from some of your other posts, you may know just how much is at stake here. like it or not,  the push to normalise s.33 is a slow-burn attack on minority rights, including gay family rights. 

as i see it, we have two chances to avoid disaster:

1) succeed in amending the \"ontario constitution\" by mutual passage through the ontario and canadian legislatures of new sections restricting the use of s.33 in ontario, whether by requiring a \"two key\" system of federal and provincial consent, confirming referendum or supermajority;

2) come out swinging with a full throated progressive rebuttal to ford's causal partisan use of s.33 to remind conservatives of why these protections are so important and why its probably a very good idea to support option 1, or else face a culture war the cannot hope to win.

or we can go with the ever popular option 3, of smiling and being nice and saying softly \"please don't hurt us.\" i've never known that third option to work, but perhaps you know something i don't. at the very least, it would not hurt our precious civility.",conservatives

1) the process has been in place for months, and is at its end.

2) the queen has to approve the prime minister’s final choice.

it wouldn’t make sense (and would be a waste of both her majesty’s and the prime minister’s time) to set up a formal audience in early june to talk about the process, just to have another audience in mid-june to confirm the final decision.

minister leblanc said today the pm “hasn’t made a final decision” but that a shortlist will be coming to him “in a few days.” my guess is that he already has the shortlist in hand, with a preference in mind, and today presented the queen with the shortlist and his preference, and briefed her on the process that was followed.

why not just tell the public that? well, really just two reasons:

1) saying “we have a shortlist, stay tuned” primes the pump for an announcement when the pm returns from the g7 (and has finished quarantine);

2) choice made or not, the final vetting is probably still happening and with no announcement made they still have time and room to back out and make a different choice if necessary.

so it isn’t written in stone, but odds are very good the choice has been made, and the queen has been informed and provided her consent.",liberals

2) allow the court challenge to bill 21 to go though. this is being done now. sometimes this works.

3) use the never used federal override clause in the constitution and go to political war with about 70 (includes bill 21 supporters) to 90% (includes opponents who think this is none of the roc's  buisness) of francophone quebec. respond to english moderates saying \"my canada includes quebec\" with \"my canada doesn't include predjudice\". dare quebec to put a knife to the throat of the confederation. 

this could work, historically overwhelming external pressure has against institutional predjudice. this is something i've thought of.

in terms of freedom of movement specifically, the eu model definitely wouldn't work, so i'd propose making immigration and work visas and stuff easier to attain or make a special pathway for canzuk citizens.

because it subsidizing daycare pushes makes it much more worthwhile to be in the labor force. children in daycare are subsidized, children that are not are not subsidized. the state accepts to spend more money per child. it's not controversial to state so, as policy-makers literally mention that a daycare program puts women in the workforce. 

&gt; a tax refundable subsidy, was never going to provide enough funding to let a parent choose to work, unless they had close to enough money to afford child care anyway.

a tax refundable subsidy renders it fair between children, as children that are not in a daycare are subsidized at the same level as those who are. it's unfair that those who don't get their kids to a daycare, for various reasons, get less money than those who manage to do so.",conservatives

h0x1ia5,2021-06-07T01:18:21.000-07:00,"the rcmp's portapique narrative is falling apart i don't quite understand the incentives at play either. there are a couple hypotheses i have, some more conspiratorial than others. 

i think first and foremost reporting on an issue like this is difficult. it's easy to collate a bunch of rcmp press releases, put it into an article, and have it out in an hour. it's tough to wade into the murky ethics of dealing with the leaked 911 calls of murder victims, let alone the rigamarole in trying ascertain their authenticity. to fully grasp the edges of a story like this you would need to be pulling from many different sources with insider or confidential information. journalism is now dominated by young people working extreme hours, being placed under immense pressure to generate enough content every day to justify their meager salary. there's no economic incentive for the rank and file to try and break a story like this, or even try and adopt a critical tone (which requires a lot more research and effort). much simpler to read a few tweets, paraphrase them, and get to work on article #15 of the day.

the second is that the cbc relies in no small part on the rcmp for their reporting. in order to fill the news across the country, especially in rural areas, police reports and press conferences as well as interviews with senior officers are a vital resource. i know people who have worked in news and they've all told me how crucial police were to them in terms of filling their article quota / time slot. now sure, you might say the cbc has been plenty willing to criticize the rcmp with respect to sexism or racism issues. but let's face it, that's small fry. that is not going to seriously endanger the rcmp's stature in this country. if it turns out that an rcmp asset went rogue and killed all these people and the rcmp didn't try its utmost to stop him, and then covered it up... you're seeing provinces ending their policing relationship with the rcmp. you're seeing mass national outcry. probably a public inquiry into the future of the institution itself.

the third is that the trudeau liberals passed controversial changes to gun laws on the back of it. do you know how much of a gun nut / prepper type fantasy that would be, a police asset committing a mass shooting that gives the government political capital to restrict guns? that's already the conspiracy theory surrounding incidents like sandy hook, if this were to be the case it would cause actual civil unrest. and then if it turns out the government tried to cover it up in the aftermath, that's the fall of the government right there, a national scandal that eclipses anything from the past few decades. now i don't think the shooting was in anyway instigated by government / law enforcement, but you can understand why a lot of people would see it that way. that would be devastating to the trudeau liberals, and federal legitimacy in general.",liberals

because i have detailed how your comparison isn't valid and is a fallacy?  i argue i'd have to understand exactly the concept of a comparison to discredit yours.

&gt;the saudis were not found to have been breaking international laws when we inked the deal.

an interesting opinion not backed by anything.  the reality is [the world has known saudi's state sponsorship of terrorist organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state-sponsored_terrorism#saudi_arabia) well before [their roll in 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alleged_saudi_role_in_september_11_attacks), so long before the harper government signed this deal and your opinion statement means you are ignorant of this fact.

any laws you think we are breaking by not cancelling the agreement, we became guilty of at the time of the signing, not after.

&gt;ditto for denying compensation.

again, just because i have shown your original comparison argument is a fallacy does not mean i deny comparison.  you are making a straw man argument.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;we wouldn’t be enforcing our national laws. we would be enforcing international laws.

another interesting opinion of yours not backed by anything.  which international laws would that be?  please enlighten me to the international laws we broke with signing the harper deal, and by honouring it.   if we cancelled the agreement and now [had to pay billions to the saudi's](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/penalty-for-cancelling-saudi-arms-contract-in-the-billions-trudeau-1.4150003) in compensation, to a government known for sponsoring terrorist organizations, would we not still be breaking those laws that don't exist?

also who enforces those imaginary laws?  canada is not the world's police.  [we have international courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_court), if we are breaking international law why are we not being charged?  you are clearly ignorant about [the differences between international law vs national law](https://www.cram.com/essay/difference-between-public-law-and-international-law/f3mypy9gr44x), and [who enforces those laws](https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/1/issue/1/enforcing-international-law) and international law in general.

and finally, a point i have made repeatedly in this thread, if we do not uphold this agreement, then an argument can be made that [our word means nothing, our reputation is harmed, and our international standing is reduced](https://globalnews.ca/news/7472391/meng-wanzhou-arrest-justin-trudeau/).

[the trudeau government has positioned canada as an international partner that does not break it's word](https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/reflections%20series%20paper%20no.18_luton.pdf) during a time when [the us repeatedly broke it's promises and treaties](https://qz.com/1273510/all-the-international-agreements-the-us-has-broken-before-the-iran-deal/).  would you like us to be like the us?  a country whose word means nothing?

how is that for a comparison?

please note how i back all of my statements with links.  you like to spew your opinion, but without anything backing those opinions up it is ultimately meaningless, easily ignored, and discredited.  i have given you the courtesy of using sources to back what i say, can you not also afford me the same courtesy?",liberals

whether that will be an effective strategy for the ndp time will tell. the ndp has more or less said whether they drive a hard bargain or not, they'll give the liberals the ability to continue doing as they please. i think it was a bad strategic move on the ndp's side to play their cards like this, but at the same time for all i know the liberals have told the ndp that either they shut up and vote for their policies or they vote them out. i don't know if that ultimatum has been made. be interesting to be a fly on the wall in those meetings between the leaders.",liberals

&gt;he spent his political career boasting about his feminist credentials, only to allow an independently documented systemic problem to fester on his watch.

&gt;but one can sympathize with the plight of the embattled sajjan and still know that he is no longer the person the situation calls for.

&gt;on the face of ever-mounting evidence that key members of canada’s military command have spent the past six years pulling wool over sajjan’s ministerial eyes, he no longer has the moral authority or the credibility to clean house.


it then kind of takes a turn from sajjan and mid-term replacements and talks about how trudeau can add to and shake up his team, including with unelected people (which isn't novel.) in a way to surround himself with better, more competent people.

indigenous affairs, pandemic recovery, and the lack of any representation in the west are all places that were mentioned where trudeau can get new blood and new brains into the mix to help him be a better leader.

the boc does not get orders from the feds, and the only recent article i can find calling into question the bank's independence is from december 2020, when some loud mouthed conservative mps were looking for a partisan angle on stimulus without criticizing stimulus. do you have any evidence to show that canadians missed what would have been a global news story? 

as for qe and expansionary monetary policy fueling the rise of asset prices -- yes, i agree this has happened. but again, these policies really can't be linked to the federal government. sure there is some coordination, but they are fundamentally separate entities with entirely different mandates. furthermore, the bank of canada has proceeded exactly as one would expect to maintain its stated inflation target, moving in sync with its international peers, and even showing a willingness to raise interest rates ahead of the us fed. there have been no major policy upsets. no shock announcements. just the same monetary policy coming out of other central banks around the rest of the western world, where -- guess what -- property prices are also increasing rapidly.

as for the cmhc changes, i don't see what you are getting at. the government actually brought in new stress tests to limit buyers' mortgage leverage, while extending equity loans to people entering the market for the first time (very popular policy in the uk). and just two weeks ago, they announced a whole suite of proposals that go far beyond what any other party is proposing. 

as for encouraging developers to seek foreign capital -- really? i certainly haven't seen this to be the case. if anything, wouldn't the proposed tax increases on foreign owners and the two-year moratorium on foreign buyers discourage foreign capital? there is a real problem of corporations buying up large amounts of real estate and packaging them as 'alternative investments' to both domestic and foreign investors, but this issue has only just entered the limelight, and no party has put forth any proposals to counter it. 

as for immigration -- we could argue this out, but again there's no point, since the questions around canadian immigration policy are much bigger than \"how does this affect housing demand?\" if we're talking about immigration, we're talking about about canadians' collective long term vision for the country, the historical and modern underpinnings of our economy, and our nation's demographic challenges. also, no party except the ppc would change our immigration quotas, so double moot point.",liberals

when harper \"united the right\", he did it in a way where the most extreme elements of the right had no choice but to vote conservative.

his authoritarian leadership style (within the party) allowed him to muzzle the anti-abortion groups and others while he threw them a bone once in a while by calling for \"open votes in the house\" after specifying that he, personally, would vote against any motion to repeal abortion rights, knowing full well it would doom the motion.

**the \"left\" has many options**

from the libs to the ndp and the green, the \"left\" has many more options and, apparently, carries enough member to be divided and still win elections in a \"first past the post\" system that allows a minority party to be in power.

**before \"unite the right\"**

before herper's leadership, the right had its vote split between the \"reform/alliance\" party, the progressive-conservative and other smaller irrelevant parties. the weak leadership of jean charest in the pro-con party did not help unite the right.

**but at the end of the day, from red tories to evangelical christian, the right is not a unified group and many of its members completely reject the others.**

what it means is that o'toole lacks the iron grip of stephen harper and does not seem to be able to force all of his members under the same tent.

**edit:** i forgot to add that the conservative suffers from a large concentration of the vote in the west. in essence it means that it wins electoral seats with many more votes it requires to win those seats. this has the effect of \"diluting\" the conservative vote because its vote is not evenly spread throughout canada.

in short: if the cpc has 6 million voters and all of them live in alberta and saskatchewan (for example) and the cpc wins every circumscriptions with 80% of the vote, and the libs have 5.9 million votes but spread in a way that it wins many circumscriptions by the \"skin of its teeth\", the libs can win a majority because it wins more seats.",conservatives

obviously looks good for singh and not a big surprise. he’s trying to tackle a lot of issues at once; you’re guaranteed to slip up somewhere. he’s also a politician so stretching truths can be necessary to get credit or just helpful to look better. 

&gt; in total, i found five false claims in 231 minutes of public appearances. i also deemed 13 claims to be a stretch, meaning the claim was broadly true, but not in the specific context in which singh said it. 

&gt; that works out to a “dishonesty density” of about one false claim every 46 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said. for reference, paul’s dishonesty density was one false claim every 47 minutes. 

so he matches paul’s rate with a larger diversity of statements. considering how densely packed his statements are with claims, that seems pretty good, but i guess we’ll see when the analyses of o’toole and trudeau are done.

which meant that most of the leadership candidates from the race dion won were mired in campaign debt that they could not pay off, because the donations they had expected were literally illegal. it took years for most of those hopefuls to get out of their own debt, which robbed the party of some of its potential talent at the top.

after refusing to resign, tupper tried to make appointments and orders in council. lord aberdeen, the governor general, simply refused to give them royal assent. this effectively brought government to a halt. tupper's party also couldn't pass legislation, since laurier controlled the house. eventually tupper resigned, and laurier and his party were invited to form government.

we have had the constitutional mechanism to deal with a pm who refuses to transfer power since the country was founded.  the 1896 incident showed it works. it is found in articles 9, 10 and 11 of the constitution act, 1867:

&gt;__declaration of executive power in the queen__

&gt;_9. the executive government and authority of and over canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the queen._

&gt;**application of provisions referring to governor general**

&gt;_10. the provisions of this act referring to the governor general extend and apply to the governor general for the time being of canada, or other the chief executive officer or administrator for the time being carrying on the government of canada on behalf and in the name of the queen, by whatever title he is designated._

&gt;__constitution of privy council for canada__

&gt;*11. there shall be a council to aid and advise in the government of canada, to be styled the queen’s privy council for canada; and the persons who are to be members of that council shall be from time to time chosen and summoned by the governor general and sworn in as privy councillors, and members thereof may be from time to time removed by the governor general.*

executive power ultimately rests with the queen, which flows through the governor general, who is \"advised\" by the pm, and cabinet (privy council). 99.99% of the time the governor general rubber stamps anything the government advises. if the government forgets they rule for the people though, then the monarchy is the institution, through the vice regal representative, that acts as the final guardian of our constitutional rights. they  ensure government officials  rule according to the constitution and convention. they remind the prime minister they serve at   her majesty's pleasure, and are there to serve the people.

the big difference is that it is government planned, ***forced*** assimilation. that is *part* of what the chinese government is doing to uighurs in xinjiang right now: they want them to be absorbed into the han majority, via forced re-education (in addition to things like forced sterilization). 

the original intent of the residential schools was to eliminate the language and culture of native peoples. there are some unfortunate parallels.  

both would meet the definition of genocide under article 6 of the rome statute of the international criminal court:

secondly, we need to stop talking about how immigration levels are racist. immigration policy and talks about it are not inherently racist. japan allows very little immigration and nobody would call them a racist country.

so to the heart of the issue, is the ppc racist? no. but they have a major issue with racists making their home in their party. i wouldn't say bernier is a hard core minority hating racist character running around asking for harm to befall different racial groups. but if the ppc is to have a future they need to clean up their act. while they may have needed to treat racist with kids gloves in order to boost their popular vote numbers, if they are tarred with the racist party tag they will find themselves repulsive to the anti establishment groups they do need to court. there are libertarian and classic liberals put there that may support the ppc but not if they are playing footsie with the sons of odin.

&gt;in june, transport minister omar alghabra announced he was advancing the target to make all cars electric by 2035, five years ahead of schedule.

as for the grid, parking lots will essentially have to be full-service charging stations. adding ac/electric heat has already put great stress on our infrastructure, tho think adding more to that system seems unrealistic. cities in the us already suffer from energy shortages, we'll really have to get innovative to overcome that.

make no mistake, politics has a bad name with the general public.  while there is often a grain of truth behind various racial or sexist stereotypes (ie: men really do think about sex a lot, etc.), there are boulders of truth behind the stereotypes surrounding politics.  

political parties are set up like any other large organization.  there is an inner circle of higher-ups, the middle management, and the minions on the ground.  and though the minions are often told that their support matters the most, it's quickly apparent that they are expected to do what they're told and nothing more.  it's also quickly apparent that only those who agree wholeheartedly with the inner circle will rise through the ranks.  that tends to leave a bad taste in most people's mouths.",conservatives

there is absolutely no reason that the sick leave should not have been 10 days instead of 5. most people never use their sick time allotment and it makes economic sense (from a progressive conservative viewpoint even) for employees to know that they have ample sick time if they need it. such employees are more relaxed, happy, diligent and likely to stay with an employer over the long term, which positively affects an employer's bottom line. skimping out with 5 days paid leave actually promotes employees to worry about their sick time allotment and does little to quell the overarching idea in our society that one should drag oneself into work come-hell-or-highwater. so i think this is a policy fail for the bc ndp for reasons similar to u/mukmuk64",liberals

if you'd prefer the bcndp to be further left that's your business, but that doesn't make their more moderate track a bad idea because of some nonsense about needing to differentiate themselves from a totally different federal party, nor because it might \"confuse\" some subset of voters that the the party is clearly doing fine without.

the point is that the analysis that /u/mukmuk64 is doing is simplistic bordering on useless, and seems to largely based on a desire to rationalize their preferred policy positions and a myopic belief that the provincial ndp parties exist to make the federal party look electable, rather than to win their own elections and govern as they see fit.",liberals

in fact it gets worse than that - if i vote for the party i prefer, it can result in the party i despise coming to power.

gjdaui8,2021-01-15T02:28:26.000-08:00,"trudeau slams blanchet for ‘pandering’ to ‘worst elements’ with comments about new minister alghabra that's not what he's commenting about though. blanchet was making vague \"accusations\" that alghabra couldn't be trusted because he was a board member of an islamic community group. it's not about the youtube guy, which alghabra already apologized for and disavowed any association with. it's about blanchet posturing for his pure-laine base by fearmongering to quebec nationalists that a scary arab guy with a funny name and a foreign belief system is in the federal cabinet.

this is going to hurt trudeau in quebec like his opposition to law 21 and supposedly tepid remarks about the hebdo cartoonist, but i gather his conscience will be fine even if he loses votes for saying/doing the right thing.",liberals
