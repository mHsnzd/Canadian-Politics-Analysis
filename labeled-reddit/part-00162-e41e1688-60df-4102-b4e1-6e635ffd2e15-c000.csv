&gt;he isn't willing to stand up to countries like china, and has made

umm, he said things are easier when you run a dictatorship, that's not a statement of loving their style of leadership, it's an acknowledgement that if he was a dictator, he wouldn't have to answer to any of us.  will you guys just drop this shit, it literally makes you look like you have the political acumen of a 5 year old.  

&gt;and while china may be producing some friendlier products on the environment, they still have no problem at all in competition involving dirty energy.

who are they competing with, using dirty energy, us and the rest of the western world, so that's a pretty rich complaint.  oh, and they don't just have some, they make the most, spend the most, install the most and reap the benefits the most of any country in the world.  of course they also pollute more than anyone, but they are also the country with the most people and they are the ones working the hardest to change things.   


&gt;we buy their shit at an increase in price, and like to say we as canadians are doing our part.   

not sure what you are complaining about here, the idea of capitalism that we pay more for things than it costs them to build it, or are you complaining that you can't buy stuff made in canada, or more appropriately won't buy stuff made in canada.  

 &gt;so my utility bill, which i have to pay by the way, oh and i'm hemmed into only 1 provider where i live, charges more for carbon tax and delivery of the utility, than actual consumption of that utility.  

i assume you are talking about electricity here.  you will find that pretty much everybody only has one provider they can buy from.   and you are lumping in the carbon tax with transmission costs for your electricity, which really have zero to do with each other.  guess what everybody else has to pay them also.    

&gt;it's absolutely ludicrous, because what am i going to do?   

well you could do what more and more people are doing every year, put up solar panels and generate your own electricity.  see you only pay carbon tax and transmission fees, on a per kwh basis.    

&gt;where exactly does the carbon taxes provincially, and federally go?   

i have no idea what province you live in, so have no clue as to what carbon scheme you fall under, so i can't answer that for you.  i know if it's the federal scheme, you can [read here](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work.html).   

&gt;how exactly does this deincentivize people to do what...live?    

it incentivizes everyone to when getting a new (or used) vehicle, to buy one that is more fuel efficient.  it incentivizes people to upgrade their homes to become more efficient when possible.  it incentivizes people to make better choices on things that the carbon tax is charged on.   

&gt;what is done with literal billions of dollars each year in 3 levels of government, and how exactly is this helping save us from cc or mmgw?   

it allows the governments to invest in greener technologies, it allows governments to invest in r&amp;d in greener technologies.  it allows them to rebate canadians for reducing their carbon footprint.  it allows them to support canadian business as they look for ways to reduce their carbon footprint.  among many other things.   


&gt;the government is simply punishing your average citizens, rather than go after corporations and large polluters etc. they allow pay to play as in, pollute all you want as long as you line our pockets.    

it does tax corporations and large polluters.  here's the thing though, as they raise the costs of the big polluters, guess what they do with their consumer products?  pass the cost along to you.  which is why it's important to have consumers demand more environmentally responsible products, rather than wasteful products.  think about how much single use plastics you bring into your home every week.  is it not better to convince manufacturers to use less single use plastic in their products, or perhaps more easily recyclable products like aluminum or paper, instead of styrofoam?  it all counts.  assuming you recycle, just try and keep track of how much recycling you put out every time.  those are some of the simple choices you can make, to reduce.  you might also find that it saves you money also.   

&gt;it's so political, and i can't believe you're not seeing it and refusing to ask gard questions of our so called leaders.   

of course you only see it as political, because you have zero vested interested in seeing it any other way.  it's kind of like only looking one way before you cross a busy street.  you begin to think that half of the people out driving are trying to kill you.  open your eyes, instead of accusing me of not seeing it.  i see it, and quite a bit more, simply because i'm willing to look.",liberals

&gt;prior to her removal from caucus, wilson-raybould had said she would run as the liberal candidate for vancouver granville in the 2019 federal election. when she was removed from the caucus, **she was also stripped of the liberal party nomination**.

this article quotes trudeau as saying:

https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/philpott-wilson-raybould-political-future-1.5150957

&gt;\"the trust that previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken, whether it's taping conversations without consent, or repeatedly expressing a lack of confidence in our government or me personally as leader,\" he said at the time.
&gt;
&gt;**\"it's become clear that ms. wilson-raybould and dr. philpott can no longer remain part of our liberal team.\"**

emphasis mine. are you honestly going to try to continue arguing she left on her own accord when there's mountains of articles saying otherwise? you're going to have to provide a source saying she left by herself to get another response from me. i feel as if i've done my due diligence.

this wikipedia page suggests in canada the caucus refers to the party, so yes, getting kicked out of the caucus is getting kicked out of the party. so your interpretation is the incorrect interpretation, not mine.

&gt;
&gt;the term is also used in certain commonwealth nations, including australia, canada, new zealand and south africa. however, when used in these countries, \"caucus\" is more usually a collective term for all members of a party in parliament, otherwise called a parliamentary group, rather than a word for a regular meeting of these members of parliament. thus, the australian federal parliamentary labor party is commonly called \"the labor caucus\".",liberals

there is a difference between dogwhistling (e.g. barbaric practices hotline, etc.) and openly calling one group of people rapists, fantasizing about brutal torture of another, and when in power, putting children in cages and separating them from their families. all of which trump did. 

your claim about election-rigging is based on a single event, and a fairly dubious source. in contrast, with trump we can point to unmpteen moments where he openly questioned the validity of an election he didn't win, including - in a national debate - instructing a group of armed terrorist to \"stand ready\".

as i mentioned, the cpc did come close to nominating bernier. but they didn't. and they tried to stop him. in contrast, the gop embraced trump whole hog, and is still in the process of burning dissenters (e.g. liz cheney) at the stake, even after trump has proven himself to be a loser. 

as for poilivere's comments about a great reset, there is some vague conspiratorial innuendo about financial elites, but i can easily find similar lines in speeches by ndp leaders. but poilivere isn't telling people not to vaccinate or wear a mask, nor was he hawking miracle cures for covid-19. if you believe canada has done a fairly good job against covid-19 (and i do), you have to give at least some of the credit to canada's mostly centre-right premiers, even if they did make some mistakes.

honestly, i don't see much of a way out for them. even the \"populist\" economic politics that somewhat worked to the south (trade protectionism etc) are a bit of a tougher sell in canada. their best chance was probably to opportunistically exploit some of the liberal scandals and squeak in with a minority, but trudeau has somehow weathered all of them pretty capably (honestly almost miraculously in some cases), and with arguably the best vaccine rollout on the planet it's hard to criticize the liberals on covid, especially from the right.",liberals

i do think that with time we do tend to accept more and more things. so of which i agree, seem like complete degeneracy. and i have no problem with gay marriage, abortion, reinterpreting gender roles, etc. 

but, there are things that boggle my mind. a man/woman walking their partner on a leash in public? oh, they not hurting anybody! a child deciding he is female because he likes to wear girlish clothes and mostly has female friends? yeah that makes sense. a teenager being anti-canadian because we are an imperialist, genocidal state on stolen land? let him/her be, she will definitely be a law abiding canadian who will integrate in society just fine. 

but, time always runs forward. we conservatives always want to preserve our culture, institutions and beliefs. we have every right to do so. but society will always change. however, it does not mean that society will just keep on moving further to the left. it is very possible that isolationism could return in the future. or maybe at one point the western world will realize that we moved too far left. in my opinion, there is no need to be concerned with what will happen in 20-40 years. live in the moment and plan for your future. and not the future of the whole world. i hope one day i will get married to a like-minded woman and have children. i would teach my children to be independent thinkers. my parents didn't make a conservative out of me. i became a conservative after going to university. i will let my kids decide their own future. and the world decide theirs.

that's not how it works. and it is stupid - yes stupid - to suggest that just because a general form of an idea is around that somehow it ipso facto means that a person who had ideas later must have incorporated that precise thinking without change.

kennan again, writing in 1951:

&gt; it was essential to [the united states], as it was to britain, that no single continental land power should come to dominate the entire eurasian land mass. our interest has lain rather in the maintenance of **some sort of stable balance among the powers of the interior**, in order that none of them should effect the subjugation of the others, **conquer the seafaring fringes of the land mass**, become a great sea power as well as land power, shatter the position of england, and enter - as in these circumstances it certainly would - on an overseas expansion hostile to ourselves and supported by the immense resources of the interior of europe and asia.

churchill in 1936:

&gt; **for four hundred years the foreign policy of england has been to oppose the strongest, most aggressive, most dominating power on the continent**, and particularly to prevent the low countries falling into the hands of such a power. viewed in the light of history these four centuries of consistent purpose amid so many changes of names and facts, of circumstances and conditions, must rank as one of the most remarkable episodes which the records of any race, nation, state or people can show. moreover, on all occasions england took the more difficult course. faced by philip ii of spain, against louis xiv under william iii and marlborough, against napoleon, against william ii of germany, it would have been easy and must have been very tempting to join with the stronger and share the fruits of his conquest. however, we always took the harder course, joined with the less strong powers, made a combination among them, and thus defeated and frustrated the continental military tyrant whoever he was, whatever nation he led.",liberals

i think the entire concept of this new holiday has been poorly implemented - even in the provinces that are recognizing it, it's not implemented as a stat holiday, so for the most part the only people that get it off are government employees.  that means that the majority of indigenous canadians probably are forced to work that day, while government employees give themselves the day off to congratulate themselves on their reflection of the past.  in halifax for example, they gave like 75% of bus drivers the day off, so the actual working class people that had to work that day had a harder time/longer commute.

sure, there probably should be a formalized process for removing the minister of justice, but as it stands it's basically just the pm fires that person and puts someone else in that position.

as much as we don't like to admit it, we do compare events in canada to events in the us. so if the pm fires the justice minister we immediately think of nixon firing the attorney general for refusing to end an investigation of hist crimes. but this isn't really comparable. wilson-raybould wasn't investigating trudeau, this wasn't an obstruction of justice kind of thing, it was simply about how to reasonably prosecute a case. it simply doesn't make sense to spend millions of dollars prosecuting a bribery case against a couple of unemployed people who would likely just get something like 6 months of house arrest at the end of it all. it would likely result in a lot of people at snc-lavalin (who had no involvement in the crime) losing their jobs and for what? couple of assholes wearing an ankle bracelet for a few months?

do we live in a country of laws or do we not? 

&gt;the charter can be over ruled by the government and laws can be forced through via the not withstanding clause.

the threshold is absurdly high, and the notwithstanding clause is nowhere near as powerful as you think it is. it cannot be used, for instance, to permanently take away women's rights over their own bodies.

&gt;so yes the tyranny of the majority could make abortion in canada illegal and the charter and court cases could be discarded.

no it cannot.

&gt;the charter isn't absolute.

&gt;
&gt;again if you agree with tyranny of the majority then you agree when that tyranny makes something like abortion illegal.

nope. you are deluded.

&gt;if you support the concept the charter is irrelevant.

so we can't pass any laws against anything because it goes against the charter? again, this is laughable.

&gt;tyranny of the majority means you support what the majority wants regardless of rights or charter documents.

it doesn't. you are incredibly misinformed over how our country's legislation operates.

except that's not even slightly true.

these are all basic, semi-auto rifles, the likes of which we've had for well over a century.  they're not appreciably faster, or more potentially lethal than any other firearm.  

most hunting rifles are vastly more powerful, and in fact the most common caliber fired by these rifles, the 5.56mm/.223 round?  isn't particularly good at killing people in the first place.  in hunting terms, it's generally considered an inadequate cartridge for hunting anything deer sized or larger.

and the thing about mass shootings is that rate of fire has almost no impact.  these are not frantic events with dozens of rounds being fired as quickly as the rifle can cycle.  in most cases the shooter could have used pretty much any kind of firearm faster than an antique flintlock, because so few rounds are actually fired, and over a fairly long span of time.",liberals

right of the bat we have this winner of a paragraph, which overstates the \"clear evidence of a significant political stance\" by ignoring that only one department is even the focus of the \"study\"/article and then goes to say that it's representative of universities as a whole. 

also, \"the center for the study of partisanship and ideology\" is a right-wing american group created only last year that does not present as a reputable academic organization in the slightest. according to their website, areas of interest for cspi include \"the great awokening\" (that's not a joke, that is the number one field of interest on their website). 3/5 of their research fellows appear to be phd candidates with no published academic works whatsoever. the president appears to be an ardent trump supporter who uses his social media presence to sarcastically mock the existence of hate speech laws as indicative of a country not being \"free\". it's really only the two board members that seem to be able to be described as reputable academics.

 i would agree that it is improbable that we will ever settle the north (which i lament because i would love the world to view us as the real world starks) but by that same merit it is very unlikely we will run out of room. the liberals plan to increase the amount of immigrants entering the country to a whopping 400 000 per yer. half of that will be economic migrants which we need, a small slice for their families, and the rest dedicated to humanitarian. 

most will be from europe, a lot from india (which is practically the most westernized colony britain had), and various other asians. when you really start to crunch the numbers, look at our slow population growth and sparse culture, canada does not seem very likely to survive as is in 100 years.  our birth rate is getting lower every year and the reality is that like china, there is a point of terminal birth rate that you cannot recover from. in the next 10-20 years, we are going to see a lot of old people retire, while a lot of even older people die (life expectancy is rising though and we already have problems caring for the number of seniors we have).

i would argue that canada will not survive without population growth and we have plenty of room. the housing crisis is temporary if we just take the right steps to address it. our population crisis is very real and will destroy our ability to compete on any level over the coming decades if we don't figure out a solution.",liberals

expenses, cost/benefit and environmental considerations all notwithstanding, the main question i always have is: where do you put gas stations? for example, the first leg, from churchill to arviat, is some 330 km, according to a rough calculation i just made using google maps. and there is *nothing* between the two. no communities at all. it's almost exactly the same distance between naujaat and sanirajak too. i think even the worst gas guzzlers can go 330 km on a full tank of gas, but it just seems so risky. if you break down, are you going to be able to call caa? would you freeze to death waiting for help?

that's nice. he didn't win for what you said no matter how you slice it. it's dishonest to claim otherwise. 

&gt;mostly because of an oil and gas boom and rebaselining in 2018 as far as i can tell and their emissions have dropped everywhere else.

&gt;because facts can be interpreted differently. you see a failure in bc. i see a $20/tonne that held the line during substantial economic growth. 

well then you're not looking at the facts. the facts are that they took into account all the likely other variables and made a prediction as to what would happen - and it didn't even remotely come close. if you're interpreting that differently - that's a choice, not interpretation. 

it failed. and emissions have gone up far faster than anticipated. that's the simple fact. 

&gt; if we fail, 30 years from now you will have to look your kids and grandkids in the eye and tell them that absolutely anything and everything was always more important than climate change

to you you mean. sorry - but deluding yourself that a thing that any reasonable person can see will not work and why is a great idea you're making a choice based on politics, not evidence. there is no possible way for carbon taxes to succeed without destroying the economy - which people won't tolerate. 

and i can't help what people like you are going to choose. i can offer facts and reason but lets get real - you have an emotional interest in it and you're not going to listen to reason. 

so it's interesting to discuss with you but i'm not trying to change your mind. that's not going to happen. 

&gt; because the strategic implications are substantial and profound, and the pentagon considers climate change a serious threat multiplier and accelerator.

i think they're right to do so. but it's way too late for us to have any hope of dealing with it now - we've committed to \"carbon taxes\" which will fail and one way or another people will decide they don't want it and vote in someone who will say \"fuck climate change, how'd you like to be able to eat?\". and by that point it'll be too late to do much, 

so i'll teach my family to focus on managing the change and adapting. 

in the meantime, you can watch as the liberals a) stop with the rebate cheques and b) climate change doesn't stop and our emissions aren't significantly changed and c) people get sick of thinking about it, just as we saw covid fatigue. unless they get punted out in the next election, in which case it'll probably be scrapped, but while the cpc may have some good ideas it'll take time ot implement anything that will actually work and lets face it - canada isn't the problem anyway. 

sorry - but it is all political. the libs have pushed the hell out of carbon tax because... it's a tax. and they like their taxes. and just like bc's tax it will stop being 'revenue neutral' quick enough. 

we had a chance to do something about global warming but nobody has taken it seriously. it's all about carbon tax and greta - none of which is going to do anything other than keep people distracted and put more money in the pockets of politicians. 



ahhh no. they went up in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. no word on 2020 but with covid there's likely a drop. 

and as to general ghg - they were dropping faster before the tax. they actually slowed down after the tax. and thats'  \"per person\" but not overall - overall they're still climbing. so - if we're just looking at the chart the tax actually slowed down the existing reduction per person.",liberals
