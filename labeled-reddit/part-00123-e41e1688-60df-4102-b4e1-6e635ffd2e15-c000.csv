[joseph heath](http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-postscript-no-1/):

&gt; ... economic recessions are rather strongly associated with a significant increase in the nastiness of politics. economic growth, on the other hand, makes redistribution much easier, simply because the transfers do not show up as absolute losses to individuals who are financing them, but rather as foregone gains, which are much more abstract. it’s not an accident that the welfare state was created in the context of a growing economy. (see benjamin friedman, *the moral consequences of economic growth*, for a general discussion of the effect of growth on politics.)

in other words, in a democracy, you can basically expand public programs as long as the tax increases necessary to finance them aren't so large - in relation to expected increases in people's incomes - as to provoke resistance. and that in turn will depend on the rate of economic growth.

kenney wants unconditional transfers from the federal government for childcare, but kenney and the ucp haven't shown any prior interest in creating a robust childcare program and have even cut pilot programs introduced by the previous government. the ucp would definitely accept these unconditional transfers and use them to offset the lost revenues from their taxcuts instead of using them for childcare.

the fête nationale wasn't deliberately chosen to be a catholic holiday, it was placed there because the pope assigned us a patron saint, the holiday has since become non-religious. the date it falls upon has been celebrated in france since before it even became a catholic holiday, it was originally pagan, it falls on the longest day of the year. the fédération des sociétés saint-jean-baptiste du québec became the mouvement national des québécois in 1972, the holiday was changed to the fête nationale, removing any mention of saints, in 1977.",liberals

so you agree, even with your unsupported assumption about the severity of the breach, that this conference is absolutely in violation of covid health regulations, and dismiss the repeated and ongoing ethics issues and outright illegal behaviour (snc lavalin) of this man by essentially saying “whatever.”

since you choose to simply ignore these egregious breaches, there are plenty of additional grounds to criticize our pm. we weren’t talking about that here but here ya go:

- publicly commenting on the colton bushie case and politicizing and undermining the justice system 

- removing protections of largely marginalized groups with his subsequent criminal justice reform by removing preliminary hearings for most indictable/electable offences  

- the same reforms increased the maximum custodial penalties (again, largely affecting marginalized groups) for summary conviction offences from 6 months to 2 years

- failure to implement election reform, a cornerstone promise of his last two election campaigns. 2019 was promised to be the last “first past the post election.” our next one is in less than a month, and was called by the man who made that promise. 

- supporting the keystone xl pipeline and tar sands drilling while posing as a climate climate warrior and first nations champion.

- speaking of first nations, trudeau promised to implement all 94 recommendations of the truth and reconciliation committee. in 6 years his government has implemented 13 of 94. 

- failure to come through on the promise to ensure clean drinking water for first nations people. over 50 communities still do not have reliable, clean water after 6 years of trudeau governance 

- canada under trudeau is one of the largest weapons exporters to the middle east

- failure to even attempt to balance the federal budget - a 2015 promise from mr trudeau. 

- zero effort to reign in the housing crisis over the past six years when housing costs have skyrocketed throughout that entire period 

as you don’t care about his multiple personal ethics issues and scandals, and are even willing to defend his hypsocrisy that forms the subject matter of this article, maybe this brief and non-exhaustive list of his abysmal track record on his policies will have some meaning.

**initial claim's support:** none.

**rebuttal:** none.

**rebuttal's support:** of top 5 media in canada, cbc is \"left bias\", ctv is \"centre\", global news is \"centre/left\", globe and mail is \"centre/right\", and toronto star is \"left\", according to \"media bias fact check\".

**does the support provided adequately rebut the initial claim?**

to answer this, let's first clarify some inaccuracies in the way you laid out the support. according to the support provided, this is the breakdown provided:

*top 5 canada media sources by web rank, with bias breakdown*

|**media outlet**|**bias**|
|:-|:-|
|cbc news|left-center bias|
|ctv news|least biased|
|global news|left-center bias|
|globe and mail|right-center bias|
|toronto star|left-center bias|

the source claims that the these are the top 5 canadian media sources, by web rank. i can't seem to find the direct source that this website is using to determine this. regardless, does this list check out? maybe. according to [\"similarweb\"](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/canada/), which provides website ranking information for canada, cbc is 2nd in canada under their \"news and media\" category and ctv news is 3rd. first is yahoo news, 4th is cnn, 5th is bbc, and 6th is finance yahoo. unfortunately, without payment &amp; registration, i can't verify if the rest of the list is accurate. it also makes sense to exclude yahoo, cnn, and bbc, given they're not necessarily canadian news outlets (though they all hire canadian journalists and cover canada in some capacity). so, based on this preliminary research, i'm inclined to believe the claim that these 5 represent the top 5 canadian media sources by web rank.

right off the bat, however, it doesn't make a lot of sense to look at the top 5 media sources to rebut the claim that \"most pundits and newspaper owners lean right\". the top 5 could all be sources that lean left, and the claim could still be true. in fact, it's possible that the top 100 could lean left and the initial claim could still be true.

furthermore, this top 5 is based on web rank, and does not represent the totality of the news consumption done by canadians. for example, the top 5 sources could all be left-leaning, and yet, the majority of news consumed in canada could come from right-leaning sources (if the top 5 represents less than 50% of the consumption, for example).

on top of all of this, the source provided does not actually quantify the number of pundits and newspapers owners that fall to the right or the left, which is essential information to dismiss the veracity of the initial claim.

but let's grant the idea that the top 5 media sources by web rank is representative of pundits and newspaper owners in some way. we then have the issue of trusting \"media bias fact check\" for their determination of political bias. what is the methodology used by them to determine on which side of the spectrum these canadian media sources land on? well, let's read what they have to say in their page titled [\"left vs. right bias: how we rate the bias of media sources\"](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left-vs-right-bias-how-we-rate-the-bias-of-media-sources/).

once again, right away, we already see another place we have to be careful. \"please take into account this chart is from an american perspective and may not align with all countries.\" the page about how they rate the bias of media sources is written from an american perspective. does that mean that they use this american perspective when assessing canadian media sources? or does this merely mean that the explanatory page itself is taken from an american perspective? if it's the former, we need to ask ourselves whether assessing canadian media sources from the american perspective accurately captures the political bias as is defined according to canadian standards. if it's the latter, then we need to be able to see the canadian version of the page to fully determine the efficacy of their methodology when it pertains to canadian media sources.

this is to say nothing about the simple fact that this page, which purports to tell us how they rate media sources' bias, does not actually tell us the methodology. it simply lists their general definition of 'left' and 'right' philosophy and then 15 issues where they define where the left wing standard falls and where the right wing standard falls.

for example, they define the left wing position on *abortion* as \"legal in most cases\" and the right wing position as \"generally illegal with some exceptions\". does this make sense when applied to canada's political parties? do we have a party that believes that abortion should be \"generally illegal with some exceptions\"? i would posit we don't. does that mean that the right wing doesn't exist in canada, on this issue? or does it mean that the right wing and left wing largely agree on this issue? not sure. even if you think that we do have a party in this country that believes that abortion should be \"generally illegal\", we still have to ask if that is the acceptable canadian standard on which to base political bias.

one should use a source with some knowledge about a source's strengths and weaknesses. in this case, we can neither determine its strengths nor its weaknesses without knowing the methodology they used to come to their conclusions.

**conclusion**

the support provided has many internal issues itself when it comes to applying that source to canada, represents a sample different than what the initial claim encompasses, and does not engage with the initial claim in the same terms or with the same units. therefore, in my opinion, the support provided does not adequately rebut the initial claim. that does not mean that the initial claim is true, however. it simply means that the support fails to dismiss it.",liberals

h2o4bpi,2021-06-22T02:53:59.000-07:00,"mps pass bill c-10, sending controversial broadcasting act legislation to senate **high level political issues**

it's concerning that the government couldn't keep to one story about what the bill was for and what it would achieve. the online harms bill is also on the agenda, as is, perhaps, fairplay. trudeau's government keeps coming up with different reasons they need government involvement in what content is served by online platforms: once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action. i don't think there's any nefarious plot, but governments seek power in the same way businesses seek profit, and it's not good to give it up without a fight.

also, broadcasting regulations were important in part because broadcast frequencies are scarce resources. if every radio station plays only american music, you can't listen to canadian music on the radio and you can't start your own station because the frequencies are all in use. spotify doesn't have that problem, so it's not clear why the explosion of on-demand online streaming services should result in an expansion of broadcast regulations. if anything, their role is *less* important since it's harder for music to crowd out other music now.

ultimately, it's hard to see this bill as anything better than \"free money and advertising for canadian institutional media organizations who just happen to be big fans of the liberal party\"

**problems with the details of the bill**

the bill leaves a lot of implementation details up to the crtc, which makes it hard to say, for example, exactly how discoverability will be interpreted.

certifying a youtube video as cancon to get favourable treatment by the algorithm requires navigating some bureaucracy. it's likely that large institutions will be able to complete the process faster, since they have accounting and legal departments, and a working relationship with youtube (and the crtc). the temperament of the algorithm determines the success of a channel, so this could be devastating, especially if someone is trying to do commentary on news or current events.

it's not clear how the bill would apply to services like crunchyroll which exist solely to import media, nor is it clear that it *should* - if i spend $5 a month on ufc fight pass, do i really owe some fraction of that to a jazz band in labrador? i think not (unless we're talking about sales taxes. there's no excuse for online services escaping sales taxes)",liberals

planned obsolescence comes from the idea that the new one will be so much better that there is no need to keep using the one you are using. products could be manufactured to last longer, but the cost would go up. that amount of price increase would be less than the future operating cost of the newer device. appliances are a great example of this. a modern fridge should only last about 10 years, but in that time, the efficiency increases means cost of ownership of a new one is cheaper than the initial cost of an older unit that would last longer. we're pretty much at this stage for everything that has an operating cost, with few exceptions (like tvs) that rely on feature updates to generate consumption.

&gt;but it's clearly just a piece of consumer crap that doesn't actually make my life that much better.

the gpc is a culturally different party than the cpc, lpc, ndp, etc. the leader is expected to represent what the members want rather than what the leader wants. it's a far more decentralized party. that's what's meant by \"spokesperson\". 

&gt;when/where did paul say candidates cannot run again?

no, you misunderstand. paul hasn't said anything directly, but her office sent out refusals to former star candidates with no official explanations as to why. if you listen to the podcast link i've sent to you, you'll see one of them, former leadership candidate judy green and former ceo of west nova riding, elaborating on all of that. 

&gt;where are the proof of the claims you are making like deprioritizing fruitful ridings for pie in the sky ones?

there's been plenty of articles about paul and her strategists wanting to focus on toronto and montréal for electoral gains. here's one example:

https://globalnews.ca/news/7709471/greens-target-montreal-seats-with-focus-on-systemic-racism/

out of every seat listed here (many of which happen to be liberal strongholds held by ministers!), the only one worth focusing on is outremont as deputy leader daniel green once obtained a good third result in the 2019 by-election. and even that is a long shot. 

&gt;unhappy for a while, paul was just elected?

yes, paul has been awful in her job ever since she became leader, which has come to a great surprise to me and many other members who voted for her. 

&gt;atwin crossed the floor because the libs asked her to and she wanted to be part of the ruling party.

atwin has admitted in interviews that she would still be a green mp if elizabeth may was still leader. the breakdown in communication she experienced with paul (paul refusing to take her call, not replying to her, etc) has been experienced by many senior greens before this whole floor crossing incident. and people whose priority is to be part of a ruling party don't run and become elected as greens. she crossed the floors because she thinks her differences of opinion will be more respected with the liberals. i personally think that's naive but we'll see. 

&gt;she is anti-israel and wanted paul to come out against israel

nope. she wanted paul to repudiate zatzman and to make it clear that her office wouldn't be working hard to defeat her in the upcoming election. she wanted assurances that the party wouldn't work against her, and paul wouldn't give it. it wasn't about having a different stance than paul's.",liberals

imo best carbon tax is only tax corporations and use the new taxes to subsidize sustainable energy research and implementation, and if the cpc wants to keep their votes in alberta they can work with the oil companies to have them run some sustainable energy.

we also have another layer of labour laws, which is the cnesst. (commission of norms, equality, health and security at work). they added a lot of regulations that go far beyond the federal level. they are also a mandatory work insurance that employers have to pay for, not the employees.

they have clear rules about reassignments, and very strict rules about firing an employee. you can't fire people for just about anything like in the roc. 

it's different, for example you cannot sue an employer over a work incident. cnesst handles everything, gets you the money based on set laws for any damage caused, fines the employer, ensures they fix the cause of the problem for others, etc.

if you have a problem with how much money you get after say, a permanent work injury, you would have to go to court against the cnesst, not the employer.

i am super knowledgeable about this because 

1- my gf is a teacher and has a colleague with a hijab

2- i used to be in management for 8 years and had to handle reassignments and let people go. 

3- that carreer ended with a severe work injury, for which i had to go to court with the cnesst. the employer also tried to fire me illegally twice during the process, or reassign me on lower paid tasks, so i can tell you i did my due dillengence and had to dig into the details of this crap. i did both higher grade admin work and lower grade clerk work while injured, they had to keep the salary the same and no one else was affected by this, they won't adjust other people's salary because of this.


so ultimately, cnesst is the independent authority on whether her reassignment is legal. if there is an issue regarding the reassignment, she would have to appeal with the cnesst, then appeal again against cnesst at labour tribunal. that tribunal could very well end up creating a precedent about this that would overrule aspects of bill 21.",conservatives

the current prime rate here in canada is 2.45%. if there's a corporate entity buying multiple units of housing, you can bet they won't be paying anywhere near that for their loans, but for the sake of math, we'll say they're looking at 2.8% interest before taking their investment status into account. that's just a 5-year interest rate, easily available from rbc.

if they're buying $500,000 homes, with a standard 20% downpayment, and an amortization period of 25 years, the difference between 2.8% and 3.0% interest is $40 a month. $480 a year. if they've gathered up a half-billion in capital, [which is actually less than plenty of publicized plans have committed to,](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6066903) they use that to secure 1000 homes, then profit from rent and property value increases. that's assuming they take on 500 million of property value, roughly in line with the article, that corporation was looking at ~4000 units with a billion dollars, but was splitting houses into two rental units, so maybe 2000 houses, maybe 4000.

the 0.2% increase means an extra $40 a month, ~$500 a year per house on their mortgage payments. i would imagine the chances of them not making a profit on their rentals is slim-to-none, especially when you consider places like london in the article have a housing inventory of ~1500 a month, meaning our theoretical small corporation just bought 2/3rds of the monthly housing supply, driving up prices in rental and ownership markets just in their act of purchasing. there's not much in the stock market that competes with those kinds of almost-guaranteed returns these days. 

so you're saying, an extra $40 a month per house is a massive liability likely to dissuade corporate types wielding funds in the 9-10 figure range? from investing in markets with 25-40% yoy growth in value, never mind rental income?  or is this poor, slovenly renter fundamentally misunderstanding your argument and missing key financial information?",liberals

freedom means some people are going to do things you don't approve of. it's the old \"i disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it\" thing. 

frankly if someone is doing something that genuinely doesn't impact someone else (aint hurtin nobody) then who are you to suggest that they're wrong?  if two guys want to bang in the privacy of their own home then what difference does it make to you? 

having said that some of your examples do impact others. running naked in a public area affects everyone using that public area.  setting up a homeless camp denies access to that area to others. etc etc.

the problem isn't that we 'dont give a shit'.  the problem is we don't have a common set of values anymore that bind us together. if 10 people see naked-guy running around, there will be 10 different opinons on it.  \"it should be fine\" \"its indecent\" \"it should be manditory\" \"it should be banned\" \"god hates that\" \"god loves the human form\", etc etc.

likewise, conservatives are a law and order party and strong believers in security and national security, in defending the country (strong criminal laws and a strong military). fiscally, they want smaller government to do what government needs to do as efficiently and effectively as possible and to have balanced budgets. conservatives don't believe the government is there to solve every problem and issue. conservatives believe in self-reliance and responsibility.

all of this is the core of what people want in a conservative party. and if voters aren't interested maybe it's because you aren't charismatic and convincing and can't explain your policies well enough to interest them. how about a little leadership instead of taking a poll to find out where the parade is going and jumping out in front?

as for conversion therapy, again, i barely even knew it existed until the last parliament. and no one has made the case this is something particularly important in canada or impacts more than a tiny fraction of people. and most of the issues the conservatives had with it were doubt about how it would be interpreted with regard to children, who many canadians are concerned are falling for a social media fad and getting drugs and surgery to change genders without proper guidance or time to think things through. children aren't mature enough to make any legal decision yet we're allowing them to make medical decisions at ten!? seriously!?",conservatives

i think you're a little confused. the liberal plan is a rebate - they tax you and give you some money back (probably less than  you gave them). that's a rebate. 

the cpc is proposing a forced savings scheme where you don't give the gov't your money, you save it, but you can only spend it on things that reduce carbon somehow. bus passes, new furnace, electric car, bicycle, etc. 

&gt; in what conservative world is more government control a good thing?

this would be less gov't control. you keep your money and decide how to spend it, rather than the gov't taking your money and deciding how much if any to give you at all. 

&gt;give me my rebate

why the fuck are you so eager to be taxed in the first place? if you want to give the gov't money and get it back you can do that at any time - just tell your employer to take more off your taxes and you'll get it back when you file. seriously - explain to me why you love giving up your cash and hoping it'll come back?

and you realize that you won't be getting any rebates at all before long. that's what happened in bc - it was all 'rebates and carbon neutral' - lasted a couple of years and then it was just a tax. same thing will happen here. 

&gt;that money should be mine.

if you give it up to the gov't, then it's not yours is it. it's the gov'ts. they might give some of it back. but probably not, and certainly not all. 

and - the libs are planning to take about 175 bucks per tonne you use. they might give some back. o'toole is talking about 20 dollars per tonne - less than the tax is now. so - you get an instant 'rebate' because you don't have to give anyone the money in the first place.

ugh, this completely misses the point.

people with long commutes and big houses don't just get more money willy-nilly. they pay more tax, and more money accumulates in their carbon savings account, which they can only use for carbon-cutting purchases. you can't use your savings account money to fuel up your f-150 or save on your heating bill, but you can use it to buy a hybrid or install a solar panel.

h1nozlw,2021-06-13T06:22:10.000-07:00,"with a federal election looming, this party is shaping up to be the campaign’s spoiler &gt; i'll give you some reasons why i believe they are centre-right -

thanks for the detailed explanation!

i think different people have different definitions of what \"centre-left\" and \"centre-right\" mean. i like joseph heath's definition. [lessons for the left from olivia chow's faltering campaign](http://induecourse.ca/lessons-for-the-left-from-olivia-chows-faltering-campaign/):

&gt; i take it that anyone who wants to move things in the direction of greater equality (i.e. favouring the poor) is “left,” which in my little picture means favouring outcomes that are below the ray that i’ve drawn between the status quo and the origin, and to the right of the status quo. these represent the set of changes that make the poor better off, relatively speaking. the “right” is just the mirror image. i then distinguish between “centrist” and “hard” versions of left and right-wing ideology, based on whether that person is willing to countenance purely redistributive transfers.
&gt;
&gt; what i think of as “centre-left” positions are those that want to increase the social product (i.e. shift the possibilities frontier outward), but do so in a way that is more advantageous for the poor than for the rich. typically this means that the person wants to provide some sort of public good, paid for by taxes that are progressive with respect to income. wanting to increase property taxes to build public transit would be an obvious example. it makes everyone better off, but the net benefit to the poor is greater.
&gt;
&gt; “centre-right” positions, by contrast, also want to use the power of the state to expand the possibilities frontier, the difference is that they want to do so in a way that favours the rich rather than the poor. typically this involves solving some sort of collective action problem, but doing so in a way that relies upon the market pattern of income distribution to establish access. (the whole “favouring the rich” part need not be read pejoratively, typically it doesn’t involve showing favour to the rich, it just means deferring to market patterns of distribution, which are less egalitarian than the pattern established through state taxation-and-provision schemes.) road tolls to reduce congestion would be an example of a classic “centre right” position – it clearly expands the possibilities frontier, generating a benefit for everyone (reduced travel times), but it regulates access to that benefit through willingness to pay.
&gt;
&gt; as far as my own political proclivities go, i am firmly in this centrist category. i lean somewhat to the left, based largely on a sentimental awareness of the fundamental unfairness of life and the extent to which my own privileges are unearned. at the same time, my antipathy toward unresolved collective action problems is so great that i am happy to embrace centre-right proposals when nothing else seems better (e.g. road tolls, carbon taxes).

using this definition, i think it's true that the liberals are in the centre, but in a number of ways the trudeau liberals are more to the left, aiming to lean against inequality and increase progressivity.

  - carbon taxes - centre-right, but in the provinces where the federal carbon tax applies, dividing up the revenue equally and returning it to households in the province is centre-left. there's a number of complementary regulations - phasing out coal-fired power by 2030, the clean fuel standard, cutting upstream methane leaks - which are centre-right (no effect on income distribution).

  - income tax - the liberals raised tax on income over $200,000 and used it to cut the middle tax bracket. not sure if this would be considered hard left by heath's definition (since it's purely redistributive) or centre-left (since lowering marginal tax rates in the middle can improve work incentives).

  - the liberals also tightened taxation of passive income within private corporations. this is centre-left, since there's efficiency problems with taxing people more lightly if they incorporate.

  - canada child benefit - replacing the harper uccb (taxable, not income-tested) and other programs (with high marginal tax rates) with the ccb reduced child poverty by one-third (300,000) at a net cost of $2 billion. centre-left.

  - cerb, basically a super-sized version of ei - centre-left, since lower-income people benefited more.

  - cews, the [canadian version of job retention](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/job-retention-schemes-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-and-beyond-0853ba1d/) - this is arguable but i think it's centre-left, since workers benefited and it'll be paid back through progressive income taxes.

  - not supporting the ndp push for higher corporate taxes - centre-right (see [stephen gordon's explanation](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/08/economic-policy-advice-for-the-ndp-part-iii-the-gst.html) of the economic impact).

  - not supporting the ndp push for a wealth tax - centre-right, based on the cost of administering a wealth tax and the likelihood of evasion. [boadway and pestieu](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canada-doesnt-need-an-annual-wealth-tax/).

  - expanding ei beyond the pandemic - [already happening](https://hicksmorley.com/2021/04/23/key-highlights-of-federal-budget-2021/#changesei)! centre-left. 

  - infrastructure funding - the liberals have boosted federal infrastructure funding. centre-left.

  - child care, pharmacare, disability assistance, long-term care, and dental care are all primarily provincial responsibility. the liberals are indeed allocating enough money to fund child care (centre-left). i don't think there's any ideological barriers to the liberals adding other programs (e.g. within the party there's a lot of interest in pharmacare), the main constraint will be not raising taxes too quickly.

  - the housing crunch - also provincial responsibility. the liberals have set up a national housing strategy which includes a lot of funding (the main lever that ottawa has), e.g. the cmhc rental construction financing program - centre-left. to cool the housing market the liberals also introduced the mortgage stress test - centre-right.

  - free trade - centre-right.",liberals

having a political preference - as i do, and i'm sure you and most people do too - is one thing. letting that political preference determine your views on the proper composition of the electorate is a very different thing.

&gt;it all leads back to the age old challenge of getting younger people politically engaged. more voter turnout is a benefit to democracy, even if it results in conservatives ending up in power because it means that the bulk of the voters actually believe in the platform.

fair enough, we agree on that. whether or not a broader electorate supports my desired outcomes in terms of policy, more voting is a good thing.

that said, i think 18 is an appropriate voting age. teens' political preferences align with their parents' to a massive degree compared to any other age group. leaving home and getting broader exposure to society - whether that's through work or through higher education - is a formative part of creating an independent political identity, and i don't think giving the vote to an age group that is almost universally dependent on their parents is a good idea.

if it weren't clearly impossible to implement, i would also be open to the idea of a selective voting right for minors under 18 based on application or something similar. the principle being, if you are clearly a critical, independent thinker as a young person, maybe you *should* be able to vote, but i don't necessarily think we need to open the right to the entire universe of 16-17 year olds.

also, although this effects a tiny number of teenagers, those 16-17 year olds who are emancipated should probably have the right to vote.",conservatives

hlnh4sb,2021-11-22T00:07:54.000-08:00,"as inflation woes impact canadians, justin trudeau will pay the price &gt; more housing

municipal responsibility. cities need to start densifying their neighborhoods, removing broken zoning regulations, and invest more into public transit.

&gt;  no foreign residential investment

i'd argue to go further. no one can buy residential property if they are not either a permanent resident, or a canadian citizen. no company can buy residential property if they are not wholly owned by a pr/canadian citizen.

&gt;  no speculative residential investment,

i don't think you can regulate this. but again, municipalities can do something about it through severe tax penalties. this is especially true for commercial real estate. streets are lined with empty store fronts because the realtors are holding out for a high paying customer. there should be severe taxes for leaving commercial properties empty and call it what it is, a blight tax.

&gt; no airbnb in residential zones,

this is again, a municipal issue.

&gt; higher property taxes

this is a municipal or perhaps provincial issue.

i realize this is /r/canadapolitics  so we talk about about federal issues here. but so many problems surrounding housing must be fixed at the municipal level first, not the federal level.",liberals

hnvwne0,2021-12-09T02:59:03.000-08:00,"old enough to choose: the case for letting younger canadians vote do you think 60 year olds aren’t tuned into the media cycle? it’s made by and for them.

regardless of what you find hard to believe, a 16 year is in better cognitive health then a 60 year old and a working 16 year old pays taxes. 

what about the not working eternally lazy rich kid from the 50s 60 year olds? should we disenfranchise them?

the voting age is inherently arbitrary and has nothing to do with individual responsibility. it has nothing to do with anything but citizenship. if 16 year olds can consent, face hard time in prison, drive, take out insurance, pay taxes and pay into cpp and ei then they have the same place in canada’s social fabric as any other older person. 

in my opinion, logically then, our countries most basic democratic right should be extended to a younger age. it’s our future and anecdotal half truths about how irresponsible a youth may or may not be (when we never talk about how responsible debra the 69 year old valium addict who thinks trudeau is a marxist ghost is and whether that might warrant taking her vote) 

it is simply a matter of democracy and self determination. 16 year olds aren’t any less responsible then people 60 years their elder. there is no time limit where you snap into great wisdom and insight at a certain age.",liberals
