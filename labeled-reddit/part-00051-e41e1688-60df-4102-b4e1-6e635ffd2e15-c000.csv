glrd6af,2021-02-02T02:03:47.000-08:00,"trudeau is more of a climate chamberlain than a climate churchill rule 8: no downvotes. if you disagree with an article, say so instead of downvoting.

by bill henderson, described as a climate activist based in bc.

i'm reminded of [joseph heath's observation](https://web.archive.org/web/20131015162150/https://thewalrus.ca/q-and-a-joseph-heath/) about progressives wanting to change outcomes directly, and being dissatisfied with more indirect policies.

&gt; q. so the impression i’m getting is that the biggest mistake the left makes is imposing its moral considerations directly on the market, which is more or less self-sufficient with regulatory oversight from government.
&gt; 
&gt; a. yeah, often what happens is that people apply their moral intuitions at kind of the wrong level. there’s nothing wrong with having a reaction to first-order results that the market generates, but often people try to correct the problems by directly intervening at the first-order level. and because the market is a staged competition, you often can’t tinker around at the first-order level. what you need to do is tinker around at a higher-order level, with rule changes and so forth. so say you’re unhappy with the way nhl hockey is working out, the same teams are always winning the stanley cup or something like that. and so you think that there’s inequality in the way that the nhl is being structured. a first-order response would be to try a direct handicap, so that [successful] players had to play with one arm tied behind their back or whatever—you directly tinker around to change the outcomes. the problem is that that can have all sorts of perverse effects. so you have to address the first-order problems at the second-order level of rule changes. that takes a little more forbearance, because, first of all, it’s not directly addressing the problem, and second of all, you have to wait a couple of years to see if it has the intended effect. you have to be willing to sort of displace your immediate moral reaction, and endorse more abstract policy remedies. and willing to wait a bit and see what happens.
&gt;
&gt; another example would be with carbon. one of the arguments you often hear from people who oppose carbon taxes is that imposing a carbon tax doesn’t guarantee that you’re going to get a reduction in emissions. with cap-and-trade, you can directly specify how much carbon you want to emit — you control quantity and let the price vary. but with carbon taxes, who knows, maybe they’ll just pay the tax. now, there is no question that if you put a tax on carbon, the amount of carbon used is going to drop. the only problem is that you have to wait and see by how much. look, the city of toronto put a five-cent tax on plastic bags, and there’s a seventy percent reduction in the amount of plastic bags being generated in the gta. i mean, five cents! there are some people who cannot tolerate the idea that it’s going to be left to the market to determine by how much carbon will be reduced, which is, in my mind, kind of crazy. **you have to be willing to let it ride for a little bit, and then if you don’t get the reductions you want, you increase the tax**. i mean the tool is capable of doing everything that everybody wants to do. i think the mistake people make is wanting to directly resolve problems that are actually more effectively resolved indirectly. 

this is exactly henderson's criticism:

&gt; the increased carbon tax — even if enacted and maintained for the decade which is doubtful — won’t be enough to even meet the too weak by half present 2030 target. 

in fact the carbon tax does rise fast enough to exceed the 2030 target - [see page 62](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/documents/pdf/climate-change/climate-plan/healthy_environment_healthy_economy_plan.pdf). and it has the advantage of being flexible: if scientists tell us we need to cut more, we can raise the tax faster.

henderson seems to see the climate challenge as a war on fossil fuel producers:

&gt; isn’t this “climate safety in our time” while doing everything to appease the fossil fuel producers?

how exactly does he think alberta will react to ottawa declaring war on its economic base? any national political party (including the ndp and greens) needs to think seriously about national unity. the #1 challenge of canadian foreign policy (as described by st. laurent in the [1947 gray lecture](https://www.russilwvong.com/future/stlaurent.html)) is ensuring that it doesn't divide us. if you're a climate voter, albertans are not our enemies! a compromise that considers the interests of albertans is a good thing, not a bad thing!

personally i think world war ii is not a particularly helpful metaphor. [chris turner](https://thewalrus.ca/were-doomed-now-what/) suggests that the challenge is more like the marshall plan, the us-funded, european-directed initiative to rebuild western europe after the war. right now the world depends on an energy infrastructure (oil wells, pipelines, oil tankers, refineries, gas stations, gas-powered vehicles) that gets 85% of its energy from fossil fuels. we need to build up a new energy infrastructure based on carbon-free energy. that's going to take time, and may well involve joint projects between bc and alberta (like [long-distance power lines](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/road-ahead-alberta-bc-electricity-bridge-interties-1.5848042)), or draw on alberta's expertise in energy production (like geothermal, or blue hydrogen production from natural gas).",liberals

frankly, everyone's to blame and they all treated this bill like a political football intended to get them points with their respective bases.

the lpc can blame the cpc, the cpc can claim a victory in preventing the bill from,becoming law, and the ndp have a cudgel to blame the lpc on in terms of killing it before it passed the senate via election period.

the ndp are irrelevant in somewhere between one-third and one-half of the ridings in the country. they are very regionalized, more so than the cpc but less than the bloc. if you do not live in a place where the ndp runs active campaigns and garners support, then it can be very hard to justify voting for them.

my deepest problem with the liberals is that they are the party of power in this country, and as such are the coziest with powerful interests. this is part of why they get the reputation for sleaze that they have: they are used to being able to cut deals and do favours. liberal governments tend to take a very deferential attitude towards elites. i don't think that's healthy.",liberals

&gt; the federal canada recovery sickness benefit, which has been accessed by 300,000 ontario workers since coming into effect last fall, pays $450 a week after taxes and is clunky to use.

&gt; queen’s park has been hoping to bolster that benefit, but ottawa’s co-operation is required, said mcnaughton.

&gt; “we heard this loud and clear from the b.c. ndp (government) last week, who called for the federal government to step up as well,” the labour minister told the house.

&gt; “there is a system in place that’s delivering cheques to workers but we can’t have the federal government paying workers in ontario and other provinces less than minimum wage,” he said, stressing ottawa has “to be part of the solution.”

cool, so the plan for paid sick days is still to get the feds to do it for you? 

the opcs are caught between one hell of a rock and a hard place. politically, out and out refusing to implement sick days is no longer tenable but actually implementing paid sick days, either by getting business to pay for them or by having the government pay for them, is ideologically blasphemous. the only way the opc can have their cake and eat it too is for the feds to pony up the cash instead.

not the greatest strategy as paid sick leave is firmly within provincial responsibility (excluding federally regulated industries). even if it wasn't, trudeau is more popular than the opc are in their own province so all the feds would have to do is wait them out so there's no way the federal government moves on this. 

likely outcome is that the opc will implement paid sick leave where no one actually gets paid or any sick leave. this program will then be touted as the best in north america ad nauseum until the election.",liberals

transcript:

&gt;	**interviwer:**the prime minister has said he is looking at making vaccinations mandatory for federal workers. should vaccines be mandatory for federal employees?

&gt;	**singh:** i think that makes a lot of sense. i think that in general canadians want to see us do whatever we to make sure everyone gets vaccinated.

carolyn bennett and the liberals straight just lied about him not supporting mandatory vaccinations. in their \"proof\", which was a response to reporter laura stone, singh said he supported vaccines and  that's unions should be involved in those plans. [this is the tweet from august 13th](https://twitter.com/l_stone/status/1426273868650528774?s=21)

transcript of singh's response:

&gt; families are worried about keeping their loved ones safe from a 4th wave and the delta variant.

&gt; **we have said from the beginning that mandatory vaccinations may be needed to keep everyone safe. and workers and unions should be involved in any plans for mandatory vaccinations.**

&gt; instead of calling an election in the middle of a pandemic, justin trudeau should focus on working with provinces to help everyone get a vaccine. 

&gt; we need to make it as easy as possible for people to get their shots. for months, the ndp has been pushing for an all-hands-on-deck approach to mass vaccinations. 

&gt; and we know that there are people who still questions about the vaccine. it's up to us as leaders to make sure those questions are answered, and people feel comfortable to get vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities.",liberals

in late 2018, early 2019 it started to heat up in bigger cities like ottawa and montreal, but never went truly gangbusters until 2020.

i bought in ottawa in 2019 and while bid wars and low stock were an issue, the prices were still \"only\" up 10% year over year the year prior and when i bought. 

the house i'm in now appreciated almost 35% since i bought. in just 2 years. and it's a national problem now that the prices have jumped significantly in almost every city during the pandemic. 

i'm all for saying it's a problem but let's not pretend that it was a *national* problem the entire time the lpc was in charge. it really has just been the last couple years where it's gotten to this scale. if the federal liberals had tried this kind of thing back in 2015 people would have accused them of pandering to toronto and to a lesser extent vancouver. 

and not one party had a significant plan of large scale like they do now i'm 2019 either. it went from a somewhat isolated issue that provinces should have handled in 2015ish, to a growing issue in 2019 that was mostly being addressed by foreign buyers taxes in the ndp platform of 2019, to a giant issue in 2021. 

i can understand taking things with a grain of salt, but i don't think it's fair to say the lpc have completely ignored or created a problem that only became a national issue in the last 2 years accelerated to this level by a pandemic that took priority in addressing at the political level.

i need to see details, though. an explanation of why these new promises will be kept, how the quality of execution will be kept high, and most importantly once there is a promise, evidence that the liberals are willing to spend political capital on pushing it through to completion without getting soft and watering everything down.

it’s very easy to make promises, what’s just as important is to have a government which won’t fold as soon as the going gets tough. the liberals saw carbon pricing through, but completely folded on electoral reform as soon as it ceased to be a walk in the park. the liberals will need to really signal their true intentions (e.g. who are they willing to piss off? how much hardball will they play with other levels of government?) for me to decide whether they’ll go to the mat on housing and if they truly see it as the backbone of their next mandate. or if it’s just another electoral reform and will be discarded as soon as there’s a hiccup in economic growth or the housing market under the guise of “now is not the time to change things in canadian housing”.

specifically around financial crime related to housing, the federal government has spent many years plugging its ears, largely pretending it doesn’t exist and allowing the bc ndp to entirely set the agenda on fact finding and policy definition. i’m honestly fine with an lpc plan on dirty money that amounts to “just do what david eby says, but turn the screws tighter and do it across the country” - but the liberals need to prove they’re serious about it, rather than just dropping some policy promises and moving along.

the best way they can prove they’re serious is to spend as much as time as possible for the rest of the campaign articulating exactly why and how they understand how bad the housing situation is in canada now and what they’re going to do about it. and not just in the big cities, since it’s now a national issue. campaigns only have so much time and the degree to which each party lets housing dominate their messaging/agenda will be a big signal to me how serious they are.

if the liberals spend a day or two talking about housing then move on to other things, i’ll know it’s not that serious. if i start to see regular and sustained outreach, sincere/genuine publicity, social media statements, ads etc from trudeau, freeland and other lpc candidates from the gta (not just toronto), vancouver, atlantic canada and southwestern ontario i’ll believe it’s sincere. in particular i’ll be looking for gta mps in ridings that aren’t yet full of condos.",liberals

you are not wrong that in a real democracy the counting system matters...but in a real vote you should get the will of the people no matter how the votes are counted (if you are not getting what the people want you are not a democracy).  i would argue that china and north korea don't really have real votes so their system is irrelevant to the discussion.  

fptp, proportional rep, direct democracy and ranked ballot are all democratic systems and it turns out if you applied them to a vote (like the 2019 canadian election) you get similar enough results every time (if the ndp or anyone else supports the liberals they have over half the seats)  https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2019/elections-federales/mode-scrutin-proportionnelle-mixte-compensatoire/index-en.html

hb3oe7s,2021-08-31T06:30:12.000-07:00,"new mortgages surge to record high, raising red flag about heloc growth well, it gets a little hard to follow at the end as the speed of the narrative and jargon increases, but it makes the point.

i'm just comparing household debt to gdp ratio for the u.s. and canada for 2008 to now.  

[in the usa](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/households-debt-to-gdp), it peaks at 2008 at about 100% precipitating casusing the crash and gradually coming down to a still high 75% and spiking to 80 due to the decrease in gdp due to covid. it's nowhere near the sane levels of 20 to 40% in the 50's and 60's when you had mortgage rates closer to a healthy 7 or 8%. now that kept property values low! 

[in canada](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/households-debt-to-gdp), we were heading in the same direction, but in 2008 it was at about 70 to 80%. it looks to me like the harper governemnt responded by allowing canadians to take on more debt causing a rapid increase in hosehold before flattening off at abot 95% in 2010. then it looks like the trudeau government slacked off and actually allowed the ratio to go above 100% before taking measures to (i think they increased the downpayment amounts). 

so both canada and the u.s. saw a 10% spike in the ratio due to the covid recession, but frankly, our possitions are the reverse of what they were in 2008, witht eh u.s. now being able to better handle the coovid crisis without a collapse of the housing market.

this is going to be a painful correction like it was in the u.s.  reuters shows that [here](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/8613/8538/pasted%20image.jpg). (article it's form is [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-debt-charts-graphic-iduskbn1xn2oh)).   the u.s. reduced debt here by predatory financial institutions hiring an army of  debt collecters around 2004. they would put the collection pressure on people for over a decade to get their profits.  it began by precipitatiing a spike in personal bankruptcies before 2006. they then went after people's houses,  precipitating the crisis and recession in 2008, with foreclosueres peaking aound 2011 and returning to normal levels around 2014. the pressure from debt collectors, however, persisted until 2017, so it looks like some people made it out, but probably lossing most of their income to these predatory financial institutions. 

this is awful and nasty. you have maybe a decade of 10m people more than usual losing their homes. i suppose in canada that would translate to about 1 million people, probably mostly the millineals that are foilish enough to take out a loan they cannot afford in the last few years as prices spike.   

really, the only way of controlling this is increasing the downpayment needed on a house by a very steep amount.",liberals

which means that our furthest left-leaning mass media outlet (competitive possibly only with the toronto star, which is about the same) is a centrist (to perhaps centre-left at the most generous) media outlet, and all other mass media is to its right. some of it, like the sun, is significantly to the right.

we have had a 'fixed election law' for about a decade now, but it's entirely toothless and nothing happens if the prime minister disregards it.

because we have more than two parties, the party who wins the election (and whose leader becomes prime minister) might not have a majority of members of parliament - i.e. might not have a majority government. many countries have the political culture of forming coalitions at this point, but canada doesn't. instead we tend to go for what's called a 'minority government', where the government tries to broker support for their legislation on a case-by-case basis. governments tend to find minority rule frustrating and would prefer to have a majority government, where they don't need to seek help from other parties to pass laws.

trudeau might characterise our previous parliament as dysfunctional and might claim that canadians deserve a say in their post-covid recovery, but the downside is the appearance of the election call as a naked power grab. i think the hit the liberals have taken this week is probably proof that a significant number of canadians have preferred the second explanation.",liberals

it's not $5000. it's a *tax credit* for $5000, so it only gets you $750 (15%).

furthermore, it's a tax credit, so you don't get the money until that year's tax refund. so if you buy a house in may 2022, you won't get the money until the spring of 2023, which is after you need it. so you still need to save the amount you'd get from the credit anyway. between down payments and closing costs you need tens of thousands to buy a house; a promise of $750 half a year *after* a five figure bill is due is useless.

this is the problem with using tax credits/deductions as a way to help people pay for things - it only gives people money after the fact, not when they need it. so any form of incentive or subsidy that is delivered as a tax credit basically screws over the poor who don't have the liquidity to wait that long.

this is the exact reason why trudeau abolished the children's activity tax credits and replaced them with ccb payments - getting a 15% rebate of the cost of putting your kid in summer camp 9 months later does nothing for someone who can't afford the up front bill in the first place.",liberals

the problem with something this scale is it requires massive industry to invest in something this large. 

an individual contractor might build one building and they won’t overly benefit from having such a huge area purchased and rezoned. as i alluded to neighbours don’t want just one mid rise apartment building in their suburban neighbourhood so the affordable apartments get blocked by the community.

think about it this way, if a six unit building costs a half million dollars to build you need to have that kind of capital to spend up front. now if you want to build 10 of them there’s 5 million dollars liquid that you are investing into solely the housing market. that’s a lot of eggs in one basket for average carpenter running a few person operation and sub contracting the rest. 

let alone if you build that many you might have to invest in streets, or the new infrastructure load isn’t supported on the cities current system in the area. suddenly you need to dig up 10km of city streets to reach the artery sewer and upsize the pipe.

suddenly the price of building 10 doesn’t benefit from economies of scale anymore. in fact it’s the opposite. housing projects look more like a staircase when you graph costs as they get larger. it takes incredibly talented and ambitious developers to optimize them within the parameters provided.

unless the attitudes of home owners shifts or the housing construction industry massively consolidates. i doubt there’s any way for these to be built in that way.",liberals

if you can see what others are bidding you can make an informed decision on how much to offer and counter offer until you reach a point where you don't want to / can't spend more. while you could end up at the same price point as blind bidding the chances of a massive difference between first and second highest offers will narrow significantly, slowing the price creep across the board.",liberals

this was much more of a local issue 4 years ago. i think it's unrealistic to expect a federal hammer drop because prices in vancouver and toronto are going up by 10% per year, when it's completely flat on much of the prairies.

the last 18 months have been a different story, with a whiplash effect of very low interest rates, massive savings for down payments during a pandemic, and a huge increase in material costs. hindsight is 20/20, but honestly a lot of people expected a huge housing _crash_ because of the pandemic, when the opposite happened. now that we know, it's expected that a federal government should have a plan at this point.

clearly, the provinces had the tools to deal with this and did not do so effectively. bc put in a foreign buyers tax which legally seems to have been within their purview, so a total ban could be done as well. municipalities need to figure out their zoning issues, with provincial incentives if need be. i don't see why the provinces couldn't have implemented rules about no blind bids and mandatory inspections either.

edit: [here's a graph](https://content.crea.ca/creastats_assets/board_charts/nsar/home/nsar_chart05_xhi-res.png) of nova scotia housing prices. there's really no consistent increase until 2020. i don't think a province that was experiencing flat or negative population growth would have welcomed federal interference in any economic activity before the last year or so.",liberals

between the increases in taxation (25 billion) and the deficit spending (77 billion) over his first 4 years in office he had an *additional* 102 billion before covid to spend.  
  
ask yourself, has health care received extra federal support? has education? the military? mental health? has housing seen any subsidization? have we seen huge investments in the arts? sciences? have vets received the 400 million they asked for, out of the 102,000 millions *in extra funding* trudeau had, never mind the basic budget.

we've been building so many in the past 30 years that i don't even recognize my home town anymore, and it's just a small town outside the gta. building sfhs hasn't worked, though i agree that limiting business ownership of sfhs is something that will need to be implemented.

&gt;this race to the bottom of coercing people to do away with home ownership doesn't address the problem.

i don't feel like there is any coercion away from owning a sfh. the government has a first-home-buyers plan and has done quite a bit to try to make home ownership more affordable. it's the market that's overwhelmed with cheap debt from low bank rates, and making it worse is foreign capital buying anything they can get in order to take advantage of stable/growing values that they don't get at home.

in what way do you feel like you are being coerced away from sfh ownership?

&gt;those at the mercy of rent-seekers are seeing rapidly rising rents as well. if the answer is \"build more\", then build more houses. 

we only have lots of land in theory. in practice, everyone wants to live in the same areas and those areas are limited. the vast majority of land that is taken over by sfh developments is prime farmland that can never be recovered once destroyed. if everyone wants to live in certain regions, those regions naturally need to build up instead of out. in any case, sustainability isn't just about the environment, it's economic too. sfh are net-negative tax income for a city due to the services (water, elec, gas, etc) costing more than the property taxes from the single owner. we all benefit when cities \"stand tall\" instead of \"sprawl\".

&gt;we should remind ourselves that perpetually increasing the population level in itself is bad for the environment.

population growth is a race against the usa who will overwhelm us if we can't keep up. i'm all for slowing immigration, but we do need it. we aren't managing it well, and that's what needs to improve. restricting home ownership to individuals, and pulling back on the cheap debt that is driving the market will help us all. we should also have more incentives for immigrants to settle outside the \"hot\" regions, though it can be very hard to convince immigrants to live in places that are often lacking immigration services and can be less welcoming than the more liberal cities.",liberals

now, some people will argue that the who is not credible, because china gives the who a significant amount of money in funding. however, the u.s. provides far more funding to the who than china does. so, i don’t buy this narrative at all. generally speaking, i personally trust the who.

with that said, my opinion doesn’t really matter. what i want to know is, why are the canadian and american governments providing tax payer dollars to the who, if they are simultaneously stating they do not trust the findings of the who?

either we trust the who and actively support them, or we don’t and we’re wasting our money. which one?

gnurqxd,2021-02-17T13:09:27.000-08:00,"trudeau said canada committed genocide. why won’t he say the same of china? probably because of a few main reasons:

1. because the genocide that has occurred in canada is our genocide to own up to, and it is something we need to do as part of the (very long) process of moving on.
2. because china is a massive superpower that has a population larger than both north and south america, and has the ability to greatly damage our economy without feeling any ill effects themselves.
3. because it is very unlikely that many of our allies in the international community will come to our aid, for reason #2 above.

it is interesting that urback mentions in her article how saudi arabia was using canada's admission of the genocide that has occurred as a way to criticize us, without providing a bit of context of why they were criticizing us. that was at the time that canada and saudi arabia were having a [diplomatic tiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada%e2%80%93saudi_arabia_relations#august_2018_diplomatic_dispute) because canada had the nerve to do the following:

&gt;canadian minister of foreign affairs [chrystia freeland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chrystia_freeland) issued a statement via [twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/twitter_diplomacy) on 2 august 2018 expressing canada's concern over the recent arrest of [samar badawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samar_badawi), a human rights activist and sister of imprisoned saudi activist [raif badawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raif_badawi). freeland advocated their release. other canadian diplomats and the canadian embassy in riyadh later released statements of their own in which they called for the release of all peaceful human rights activists detained in the kingdom.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canada%e2%80%93saudi_arabia_relations#cite_note-thestar-14)

and because canada advocated the release of peaceful human rights activists, saudi arabia lost their shit, and began implementing economic sanctions, recalling students, cancelling flights, etc. which isn't bad in itself...but what was crappy is that we received barely any support in the international community. some positive statements from some eu countries, but that's it. (and to rub a bit of salt in, john baird decided to wade in and went on sa television and stated that trudeau should fly to riyadh and apologize to the royals in person).

so if that's what the international sentiment was from the saudi's, what are we to expect from china - which is notoriously thin skinned - and which has deep economic ties to pretty much everybody? painful trade sanctions that will negatively impact us as we try to recover from covid, and radio silence from pretty much everyone on the international stage, lest they receive the same fate.  it's only really if a large chunk of the international community got together (which is starting to happen about [some things](https://globalnews.ca/news/7641177/canada-arbitrary-detention-coalition-2-michaels/) \\- even though china wasn't specifically mentioned, and even then they still lost their shit) in which this would even be feasible, but i don't see that happening anytime soon. (the us government, in trump's last days and continuing with biden, have denounced the uyghur genocide. this is great, but the us is almost singular in its ability to handle a tiff with china, as their economies are tightly connected - china and canada - not so much.).",liberals

3) diversionary programs for at-risk individuals. 
- utilize camps to get troubled youth away from their trouble-making peers. furthermore, give paid leave to parents who want to attend these camps with their kids, to return to a functioning family.  hopefully, with mental and emotional tools to address issues within the family in a constructive, meaningful way.

here's what harper says in a speech in london, england in 2008.

&gt;for the first time ever, we are establishing a regulatory framework that will impose mandatory emissions reduction targets across the spectrum of canadian industry.  industries will be expected to produce 18 per cent less greenhouse gasses per unit of production in 2010 compared to 2006, and those targets will get tougher by two per cent each year, each and every year.  this will lead – and this is important – to absolute reductions in emissions, not just reduce carbon intensity.  it will lead to an absolute 20 per cent reduction, as i’ve said, by 2020.  canadian industries that do not meet their emission reduction targets will be required to do one of three things.  they will have access to a domestic carbon trading system which will include offset credits for non-industrial practices that reduce emissions.  we eventually hope to participate in a north american trading regime, depending on what action the united states takes, and i’ll talk about that in a second.  we likewise hope to participate someday in a more mature and robust emissions trading regime internationally.  as well, industries will have access to credits through the united nations clean development mechanism…

&gt;i should mention that while our plan will effectively establish a price on carbon of $65 a tonne, growing to that rate over the next decade, our government has opted not to apply carbon taxes.  

&gt;carbon taxes will establish certainty about price, but not about outcomes.  the central purpose of our plan is to create certainty about emissions reductions, not to raise revenue for the government.  our plan will compel industry not just to pay for their carbon emissions but to actually reduce them.  industry has told us they want and they need certainty.  our framework provides that.  clear targets, realistic timelines, fair across the board application.  now industry knows what they need to do and when they need to do it.

it’s also *much* easier logistically for the employer who’s already doing that employees payroll to just compensate them for the equivalent of x days pay if they’re sick. adding gov program beaurocracy should be avoided where possible. 

most higher paying jobs already have sick days paid by their employer, so why should the public pay for sick days on a permanent basis just because they’re low income? a temporary program i’m reluctantly ok with, as covid has really highlighted the immediate need.

however, because the vote is split so much in this poll, 33% for ford would result in a 5% margin of victory. 5% is certainly enough to win a majority.

if you look at how ontarians view the government's handling of the pandemic: [63% say the party has done well](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/poll-shows-support-for-doug-ford-government-steady-despite-criticism-of-pandemic-handling-1.5363326), including 59% of liberal party supporters, 45% of ndp voters and 44% of green voters.

the liberal number is most important: the same block of people in ontario that make the province's huge seatcount the bedrock of support for the federal liberal government is the same group of people who placed ford's pcpo government in office provincially. there is a history in ontario of placing one party in power in ottawa, and the opposite party in power at queens park.

recall as well that the pcpo is the natural governing party of ontario, much as the liberal party is at the federal level. dalton mcguinty was the first liberal to win back to back majorities here since mitchell hepburn in 1934 &amp; 1937. the pc party was in government in ontario for all but 28 years of the 20th century. it's the 2003-2018 period of uninterrupted liberal rule that is the aberration in the political history of ontario, not the pcpo win afterwards.

there are a number of theorized reasons for this, but the fact remains that i would not say that ford is personally unpopular or disapproved of. generally, people seem to approve of his government's handling of the pandemic (the key issue of late) and are comfortable with pcpo government compared to the alternatives on offer.",liberals

* can the scandal be reduced to a one-sentence soundbyte (but not easily refuted/denied with a one-sentence soundbyte)?

* does the scandal cut against a core element of the candidate’s brand?

    no, i don't think so.  the liberals are not associated with or trying to fend off a reputation for being anti-lgbtq, so the association is less likely to be seen as saying about the mp's views.  it might say something about their vetting process for their friends, but that's a much less sexy story.

    no for the cpc, yes for the ndp.  the cpc itself tries to fend off a reputation for religiously-motivated anti-lgbtq views, so if it condemns this too hard then it invites scrutiny into its own far more close associations.  the ndp can use this, but it also has the smaller national profile.

unless housing pricing becomes a government regulated market like the price of milk or eggs (read essentials) i don’t see a way out of the attitude. 

if you want to address housing, i think the government needs to decouple housing and savings but good luck getting voted in on that platform. i suppose if there was a glut of government owned housing to compete with housing sales so only people who wanted to own could choose to do so. but as someone with family in the military, i can tell you pmqs don’t feel like the right answer either. 

it’s an incredibly complicated issue that can be attacked from numerous avenues. but every attack feels like it hurts others. 

a delayed equity bracketed tax similar to income taxes (but independent from income tax) on all future sold homes could be an answer that in turns funds tax credits for non home buyers to equalize the differences between buying and renting somewhat. it can’t be absolutely even due to risk but realigning rent prices and ownership costs would be a step in the right direction. that way it doesn’t impact those who already owned their home and made that decision 30 years before the policy rolled in to be punished as they retire but forces those who going forward choose that route that they are actively making a choice. buy a home risk yourself in the market, win too big and it gets clawed back.",liberals

not sure what you mean with permitting? obtaining a permit? we already have those + red tape galore. if you have a pal, a wildlife card/hunting stamp (province depending) you can go hunting/target shooting on approved land. there shouldn't be any other permits needed to leave a house. that's covered already if you have a non-restricted firearm. 


&gt;having said that, i don't really know why anyone needs an assault rifle like an ar-15 to hunt

it has its uses for varmint hunting, as well as small game with trapping. for instance, a trapper can make/buy ammunition for the ar that doesn't expand, and will save the pelt from exit wound damage. it's light, easy to handle, quick to shoulder and not overly expensive. 

an ar15 isn't *needed* for hunting/trapping, but it's a great tool to have. we can't hunt with one in canada, so that kind of eliminates that idea. you can get other semi-autos and bolt action rifles of a similar caliber that's better suited for the task of small game. 

&gt;i also think there is room to distinguish between acceptable and unnecessary guns for a civilian to have in their arsenal

the issue is who gets to decide that and why. i had a rifle that would not be suited for anything other than squirrel hunting that was made illegal because it *looks* like an assault rifle. i also have a semi-automatic big game rifle that would be overkill for anything less than a bull moose, but because it's a boring hunting rifle nobody really cares or bats an eye.",liberals

like just recently alabama passed a referendum that essentially bans abortion and puts it into their state constitution, does that make it ok? because a majority of the people wanted its suddenly ok to deny abortion rights?

we may not have property rights in the sense that we are immune to confiscations from the government ie 4th amendments. however we do have laws and standards that say laws must be \"reasonable\", 

&gt;reasonableness review is concerned with both the decision-making process and its outcomes. to be reasonable, the court must be able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic. a decision must also be justified in light of the legal and factual context, including, most importantly, the governing statutory scheme.

unless, 

&gt;instances where correctness review would apply, such as constitutional questions, questions of law of central importance to the legal system; and when addressing questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies.

with that being said you can still argue both points. you can argue that it breaks a section of the *charter*, while also arguing that it breaks the reasonableness standard. that way if the court rules against your constitutional question, they may still rule in favour of you with the reasonableness standard.

as to how this applies to the gun laws, everything in the may 1 oic and c-21 is being challenged on both constitutional and reasonableness grounds. constitutional is not likely, but the reasonableness grounds are quite strong. in the ongoing court cases the governments only defence thus far has been \"we did it because we can\". that type of argument would not suffice for the reasonableness standard. whereas the applicants have affidavit after affidavit with evidence pilling up that shows these laws are unreasonable and overreaching. when the federal police union, the chiefs of police association, and criminology professors say it won't work, that's some fairly serious grounds for unreasonableness.

we will see how this plays out in court, a decision is expected by the end of the year. it's likely both sides would appeal up if they lost the case, so if accepted this could go on for years.
