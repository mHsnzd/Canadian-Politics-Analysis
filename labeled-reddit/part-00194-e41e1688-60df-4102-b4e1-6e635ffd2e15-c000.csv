honestly, vuong's best move right now is apologize, resign, liquidate some assets, take a 1-2 year vacation, grow as a person and move on with his career. the current environment isn't good for his riding, but it's also not good for his mental health -- and it will only get worse if he gets sworn in. $180k/yr salary for a guy with a bcomm and llm and who has hustled a seven figure business is not worth further jeopardizing his career or health.",liberals

neoliberals concerned about the environment have also created and will maintain a circumstances in which the costs of climate action will rest almost entirely on the poor and the working class as a whole, both because they've systematically destroyed the capacity of anyone but the heights of capital to guide policy and because the policies that neoliberals who are concerned about the environment support (e.g., carbon taxes) have incidences that fall almost entirely on the final consumer, as the primary polluters of the world today are industries that produce inelastic goods.

neoliberals that are concerned about the environment, also, due to their antipathy the provision of public goods delivered do things like raise the cost of transportation by cars, but don't seem to account for the fact that individual consumers can't simply 'choose' to use a public transportation system that doesn't exist/is insufficient in it's place, or 'choose' to work from home instead when they are not trained for such a job/their internet connection is insufficient to do so.

lastly, neoliberals who are concerned about the climate's best bet for meaningful cliamte action are asset management firms like blackrock going to companies like exxon and others and requiring action from them because since they own assets across the board in the economy, they have at least some of an interest in mitigating climate chage on behalf of their other assets. unfortunately, just as exxon externalizes costs because they don't have to pay for it for the sake of their profits, amfs will ultimately adopt climate act policies that externalize costs to anyone who isn't a shareholder/owns a sufficient amount of assets to have them come out ahead for the costs externalized to them. the end result, being, ultimately, a rising tide that drowns those without boats or boats liable to capsize, again, a global climate outcome, supported by the ignorance and malice of neoliberals that will utterly dwarf any previous atrocity in human history.",liberals

i see no reason to believe that capitalism can be regulated into something sensible and pro-democratic. 

capitalism inevitably concentrates power, rewards the rich for being rich by making them even more richer, carries deeply irrational beliefs like ever-increasing profits every quarter and exploits workers in order to \"create\" profit for the rich.

25,000 people died today of needless starvation. america wastes 30-40% of its food ever year. we had the resources to feed those people but don't because doing so doesn't make profit for the rich.

it's a genocide of the poor and all due to a system which benefits us first-worlders at the expense of those 25,000, and countless others.

so no, there's nothing wrong with being a neoliberal who's concerned about the environment if only because it's at least it's one more person who cares about the environment.

i think neoliberalism is capitalism's 'white moderate' that mlk warned about. 

&gt;more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; **✓**

&gt;who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; **✓**

&gt; who constantly says \"i agree with you in the goal you seek, but i can't agree with your methods of direct action; **✓**

&gt;who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; **✓**

&gt;who constantly advises to wait until a \"more convenient season.\" **✓**

the last one is particularly apt. \"now's not the time\" must be a mating call for neoliberals. i hear it often enough.

-------------------

what you're describing is a way for the rich to stay rich while slowing down any regulatory changes enough so that they can be watered down when people don't care about it in 3  years time when government is finally reading to do something. 

it also lets the rich better adapt, own and control the market as they have been for too many decades.

&gt; even ignoring the s.2 aspect of the law, it still fails on a s.15 basis because it privileges certain religions (namely, christianity) over others in a clear and obvious manner.

the catholic church certainly doesn't feel that way, since they also openly oppose the bill. let's be honest: the reason why christians are affected less by this bill is because the shambling corpse that passes for christianity in canada, and particularly in quebec, demands practically nothing from its adherents. this province is filled with self-identified \"catholics\" who never go to church, never pray, barely believe in god, and would immediately laugh in your face if you'd ask them if they follow what the pope, the head of their religion, says. it's not a religious privilege: it's that the law mandates the absence of religion in authority positions, and christianity in quebec is practically an absence of religion. and muslims, jews, sikhs are all free to take the same approach, if they feel that strongly about being a cop or a judge.",conservatives

&gt;the federal government source told the globe that so far, ottawa has been able to deal with cases individually, so implementing a resettlement program hasn’t been needed.

&gt;alexander cohen, a spokesperson for immigration minister marco mendicino, said that in 2009, the government introduced a program for certain afghan nationals who served as local staff in kandahar province or were on a contract in direct support of the canadian government.

&gt;in 2012, he said, immigration, refugees and citizenship canada began implementing a revised policy toward reassessing cases that were not successful under the first one. more than 800 afghan nationals, including family members, were resettled to canada under the initial policy and its successor.

&gt;afghans who were not eligible under the policies, he said, may apply to immigrate to canada through existing provisions under the immigration and refugee protection act. and those who do not meet the government’s immigration criteria can request humanitarian and compassionate consideration.

&gt;“we are closely monitoring the evolving security situation in afghanistan,” he said.

&gt;new democrat immigration critic jenny kwan said as canada’s allies withdraw troops from the country, “time is of the essence” to resettle afghan employees who aided the canadian government.

&gt;“to say that canada will monitor the situation, which is the minister’s response, that’s akin to saying that canada will stand on the sideline and watch as afghan interpreters receive the death sentence,” she said in an interview.

&gt;ms. kwan also took issue with the idea of dealing with cases individually, calling it a “stock answer to quell public pressure.”

&gt;afghan interpreters who helped the canadian military, ms. kwan said, should not be left behind.

&gt;conservative immigration critic jasraj singh hallan, defence critic james bezan and  public services and procurement critic pierre paul-hus issued a joint statement saying that the withdrawal of u.s. military forces and nato partners in afghanistan has given rise to increased taliban activity in some provinces, and that afghan interpreters who assisted the canadian armed forces are receiving death threats.

&gt;“as afghan interpreters plead for assistance from this government to flee from these threats of danger, the trudeau liberals are slamming the door shut,” the statement said.

as you move further left or towards activist groups, this is sort of what starts to happen. people just start thrashing each other over moral missteps and everyone develops hurt feelings. we all carry a blinkered perspective. we can't help it.

but i'm perfectly aware of why the liberals are a successful party. i've lived in alot of places here, the number of perspectives out there are crazy. two linguistic solitudes, ten provinces, 5000 km of space, urban, rural, dozens of first nations communities, hundreds of immigrant ones.

the liberals are a brokerage party which soft pedals these differences. they're the dictionary definition of centrism. everyone's compromising somewhat, everyone is being politically correct, tolerating some imperfections, to exist in that big tent. you can call it cynical, but in a country as ridiculously diverse as this that i've heard multiple times from different people shouldn't even be able to exist or shouldn't exist or is doomed (no matter where i am), it's the only political party that can hold any power federally without completely imploding.

i'm generally green. it's my natural perspective as an atmospheric scientist. i'm going to wait this out and see what happens and hope everyone manages to take a breather and reconcile without literally destroying the party. paul nearly won a riding well outside the green base and deep in liberal territory and the liberals pegged the carbon tax to our 2030 copenhagen target in response. that's a very large victory. i'm not used to victories. she deserves a shot even if the old guard doesn't like what she says sometimes. the rural green base and huge potential in atlantic canada and vancouver island also needs to be respected. these folks need to work together.

but maybe that's impossible. maybe human nature forbids it. in my teens i used to think that with a bit of hard work and muster the greens could win government one day. now i think anything taking out the liberal party of canada is completely impossible. even if layton did, once he got in government some rabble rousers would have started some lefty party and we'd start the cycle all over again. it already happened in bc.

h768vns,2021-07-30T15:33:41.000-07:00,"erin o'toole says he'd let new brunswick decide how to fund abortions hi! 

i live in saskatchewan and supported peter mackay in the last leadership race, i also voted for and supported brad wall provincially. i consider myself to be a centrist and have voted for a variety of political parties over the years. way back in the day, maybe when you were still a child given the demographics of reddit, i supported mulroney. 

i was initially hopeful on o’toole but once he made a play for the socons in the leadership race i quickly soured on him (let me be your second choice etc…) 

for me social issues are a red line. i can’t support conservatives who want to tamper with that stuff, those conversations are not helpful to the country as a whole and have largely been settled for ages now. i am not into culture wars and think we should all be free do so what we will - individual liberty and john stuart mill are big drivers of my political philosophy 

it’s anecdotal i know but my friend group largely all feels the same way. remember, i am in rural saskatchewan, this is the conservative heartland, nobody that i know has an appetite for this socon bullshit. i am sure there are lots in this province who do, i have just yet to meet any of them, 

a few of my buddies are planning on not voting conservative over o’toole’s flip flop on the carbon tax and a few more are not going to vote for him over conversion therapy (they have gay family members) incidentally, a few will vote maverick as they say they are not going to legislate on social issues. 

i don’t know how i will vote but i doubt it will be for o’toole. if mackay won i’d be donating money every month. 

so yes. lots of us do care about abortion in new brunswick as from my point of view socon issues have played a large role in the conservative party losing the last three elections.",conservatives

h6ev2r2,2021-07-24T08:26:09.000-07:00,"liberal majority government in ‘doubt’ as lead over conservatives shrinks, poll finds - national | globalnews.ca hi there. congratulations. a friend showed me your post and i really wanted to say something to you. i normally don't use reddit anymore, but made this account just for you because of how skewed your take on that data is.

that report you are using is a kind of problematic one for the point you are trying to make. there is a lot of nuance to consider in how those numbers came to be. for instance nunavut would of course have an increase  in ghg emissions, since it's been slowly increasing in population and infrastructure. the same can be said of saskatchewan, which saw increases. quite frankly, if you take a unbiased look at the data and compare it to your comment; it doesn't match up. how so? well, to be blunt about it, only about half of the provinces you are claiming to have gone down actually did. the other half are rather stagnant insofar that they have gone up and down, almost equally in some cases.

go ahead and look at the long version of the data with all the numbers to get a better look at the reasons why you are all sorts of wrong here pal.

some points to leave for you to consider.

1. from 1990 to recently, the prairies have gone through a lot of ups and downs both economically and populous wise. with that comes a lot of changes in ghg emissions.
2. bc is mainly a tourist attraction. sure it has other economic capabilities as well, but by and large when the tourism is down, so is bc's economy. we saw this full and true with the pandemic. so imagine being a province built on mostly tourism before that point. what are you going to have a constant use of? transportation. what does that entail? more ghg emissions.
3. the other provinces that do lend towards your point at all, are all provinces that people are mostly ***leaving***. especially towards the greener pastures of the prairies from my earlier point about them. the natural result of this is that there will be less ghg emissions in those areas. if anything, the main reason why we see a stagnation in some places is because of the immigration balancing things out, i would wager to guess.

i hope you can take this all in the best of intentions. i just saw you use the wrong data to prove your point and felt the need to point it out. greatly enough that i made an account on a website i despise.

i see jenica winning again regardless of which banner she runs under, green or liberal. fredericton isn't a seat that the green strategists were worried about, despite the tight race of 2019. but given that she has defected to the liberals, she'll win there as a liberal. many nb greens want paul to resign as leader, and many of those in fredericton talk about voting for jenica as a liberal as an endorsement of jenica as a candidate and also out of spite against paul's shit leadership, to send her a message. 

there'll still be those who will vote green regardless of jenica's defection. but their results won't be nearly as good as they were in 2019, and may likely end up in third place behind the tories.",liberals
