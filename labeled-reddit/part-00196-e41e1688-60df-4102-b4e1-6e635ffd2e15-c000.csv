*”with his cult of diversity, justin trudeau has pushed this ideology even further into a form of extreme multiculturalism. he described canada as the first post-national state, with no core identity.”*

*”in a free society, immigrants have the right to cherish and maintain their cultural heritage. however, that doesn’t mean we have any obligation to help them preserve it, with government programs and taxpayers’ money. the vast majority of canadians rightly expect them to learn about our history and culture, master one of our official languages, and adopt widely shared canadian values.”*

yeah, there's honest ways to look at statistics, then there's what you just said.

the us has had 800k deaths in 2 years. the problem is that the way they count those deaths, as admitted by the cdc and many state and federal health officials, is that anyone who dies and tested positive for covid is counted. many of these cases, when examined, end up where covid isn't what killed the person. further, the vast majority of the deaths were old people, to the point where (just like canada) the average age of covid death is older than the average life expectancy.

my kids have aged out of needing childcare, so i'm not really emotionally invested in this issue any more, but back when this was last floated by the liberals, i was opposed based on:
1) taking choice away from parents - parents have arranged their lives to care for their kids for years, and the proposed plan is a one size fits all that will leave many families out or potentially make family lives worse
2) the benefit isn't income based. it makes absolutely no sense to me that top 1% can choose to get this benefit but someone who needs overnight  childcare  for a low wage night shift potentially faces increased taxes but is left out of the benefit.
3) the cost and lack of clarity on how the costs would be funded.
for full disclosure, back when our kids were little, dh ran a small daycare from our home and i was the primary income. the 'we must save the women trapped at home' messge also rubbed me the wrong way... along with a lot of messaging from trudeau it came across to me as infantilizing women, not supporting them.

you might want to reconsider the notion that numbers on a balance sheet are indeed fictional (or at least research what happened to countries or empires in the past that just printed money or diluted their currency when it was precious metals etc).

i find it strange how many rationalize this (excessively increasing government debt is not real or a problem) with government money but they themselves wouldn’t just max out their own credit cards (because then it would real and not fictitious?)

i find it scary that every 6-12 months in the us there are articles about debt ceilings, and potential government shut downs because their (usa) finances are so bad; essentially a persistent threat of anarchy related to government finances.  

our current government has doubled the national debt in their time in office (more debt than the previous 22 governments).  there are also these lpc numbers:

https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/canadas-spending-and-deficits-higher-than-comparable-countries-during-pandemic

regarding the lpc’s carbon taxing, there are also concerns:

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/globalnews.ca/news/7646946/canada-carbon-tax-experts/amp/

 especially in these times (country on fire, highest ppm of c02 ever measured) it’s hard not  agree with you: it’s a problem that needs attention.

some questions you should ask yourself regarding the topic of a carbon tax (for comparing party platforms), while knowing the goal is to reduce ghg emissions.

-where has the carbon tax money gone under the lpc’s control (consider the nuances, eg. sometimes the province is running the tax sometimes the feds)?  try an find (specific) examples online...

-the lpc tax is said to be 90% revenue neutral (so 10% lost to the gov coffees).  how does this compare to the ndp, greens, cpc?

-would you prefer to have more control of these funds yourself (cpc plan)?

-relative to the g20 (g20 essentially all trying to cut ghg emissions right now) how much is canada paying for carbon emissions relative to its peers? are you sure ok paying more than your neighbour (or less in some cases/countries)?

-food for thought, 70c a litre in some us states, 1.75cad in vancouver (maybe 1.40 with usa conversion) so double...

-at what cost is it to your generation (the carbon tax) to be paying more for consumer staples (effected by carbon tax) when trying to save up for a school, car, house, needful things etc? what is the goldilocks amount of carbon pricing?  is it the most?

-because financial things are tied together, is the added inflation this tax is causing a concern to you (keeping in mind minimum wage increases are always lagging behind inflation, eg see current living wage complaints or the minimum wage buying power of the past vs the minimum wage buying power of today)?

at least for me when i think about the nuances, and break down the issues, it’s not a simple cpc bad and lpc good (and visa versa... cpc platform and party have issues too).

that is the verbatim text. in order for quebec to have actually made a constitutional amendment about the status of these languages, there has to be a part of the constitution for them to amend in the first place. there is no part of the constitution that makes quebec bilingual to begin with, and merely having only french as an official language would not negate the charter rights to minority education rights (just as there is a requirement for alberta to educate people in french even though english is very clearly the only official language of alberta).",liberals

almost as if it isn't hamas that is the biggest issue but rather the genocidal nuclear armed regime on their doorstep slowly stealing more land as it surrounds them with conditions made explicitly to entice them to leave the area.

saying hamas is the issue is like looking at a woman being raped and saying that the issue is she is scratching her rapist, and that is why the rape must continue. without israel's occupation there would be no need for hamas. if it wasn't for the dispossession and expulsion of the palestinian people and the constant denial of their right to return to their homes on the basis of their ethnicity there would be no need for that resistance.

the problem isn't hamas - hamas is just an easy place to point to because it's easier to point to them than pointing to israel and actually doing something to end this. end the occupation, give the palestinians stability, give them the opportunity to educate themselves and get ahead and you won't see extremist movements. that works everywhere. on the other hand if you keep oppressing them, keep denying them those things, keep killing them and making them live in fear for their lives then the problem isn't the hardliner resistance to that - it is what you are doing to them and that alone.",liberals

a provision added to the constitution affecting the use of english or french in quebec would be a provision relating to the use of english or french applying to one or more provinces. there's no requirement that the provision in question already exist for section 43 to apply to it.

note, the application of section 43 specifically to changes affecting the use of english or french is not a result of 43(b). 43(b) is a specific example of a change which could be made under section 43; it does not in any way limit the application of the section (the word \"including\" specifies a non-exhaustive list). the reason section 43 applies to such changes is because of section 41:

&gt; (c) **subject to section 43**, the use of the english or the french language;

since section 43 requires strictly fewer legislative assemblies to consent to an amendment, this makes it clear that, if an amendment can be passed under section 43, the unanimous consent specified in section 41 is not required. however, if section 43 doesn't apply for any reason, then unanimous consent would be required under section 41.",liberals

the problem here is that justin trudeau has all the same strengths as singh, but trudeau also has the brand of the liberal party granting him a perception of seriousness and competence. having been pm for the last 5.5 years also boosts his perception of competence/being serious.
