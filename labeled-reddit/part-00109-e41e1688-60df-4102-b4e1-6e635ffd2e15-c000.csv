the same health officials we've been closely listening to and following on pandemic issues have been completely ignored on the toxic drug issue. dr. henry in bc, along with the cov and bc government has been *begging* the federal government to decriminalize drugs and it still hasn't happened.

lately the image management has shifted back to the 2015 style: new hairdo, no beard, no jacket, sleeves rolled up and shirt unbuttoned, nearly all the money giveaways done by him personally not so much by ministers.

i actually agree with your argument about the cpc for the most part and your remark about a progressive fiscal conservative party. i have grown up in poverty and struggled to find success due to mental health issues. it is our duty to look out for each other when we can, just as much as our self.  i am of the opinion that when one sees someone in need of aid and has the ability to render that aid without harm, one must. in failing to do so, you diminish yourself and so diminish the world.

however i also believe virtue without moderation can rapidly sour into vice. humility can become arrogance, wisdom becomes ignorance, courage to cowardice, chastity to lust and gluttony, justice to injustice and tyranny.  all of the oldest democracies in the world have changed or reformed over the centuries. and with those changes and reforms, came alot of dead people. over 60 000 for the first english civil war and tens of thousands in the two that followed. almost 2 million dead in the american civil war.  it took the death of 85 million people worldwide to restore half of germany as a democracy. these countries have histories stained in vast amounts of blood and horrors we never really had to endure.

that seems to be the part you can’t wrap your head around. **the petition itself is what’s unconstitutional.** that’s what the party’s lawyers told national council, your argument that we might as well throw the constitution out because we’re not following it is completely invalid because the party is — by your logic allowing this petition is akin to never bothering with a convention again.

here is literally the part of the constitution that’s relevant to this petition:

&gt;12.8 all matters to be voted on in a referendum shall be in the form of a resolution including a resolution to amend the constitution.

so what’s a resolution? well most of them are policy resolution but there are also dispute resolutions. so let’s take a look at the first line there:

hof469u,2021-12-13T03:59:26.000-08:00,"338canada: the quebec liberals in free-fall (20% support overall, only 9% support amongst québec francophones) &gt; so is federalism dead in quebec?

no. the independence question is dead in quebec (for the moment).  there was always a faction of federalists who were basically a pro-quebec lobby group and were pro-federalism because they thought that the benefits of staying in canada outweighed the costs (and if that changed, they would vote to leave).  and there was always a faction of pragmatic sovereignists who were only pro-sovereignty because they thought that canada would restrict quebec too much for the province to implement the policies they wanted to implement (and if that changed, they would become federalists).

those two factions combined, and that's basically what the caq is.  legault himself was a former cabinet minister for the parti québécois, and a lot of his senior ministers used to be part of either the liberals or the adq (which was basically this...autonomist party?  i think that's the best way to describe it; federalist, but very pro-more-powers-for-quebec).  funny story: the current leader of the quebec liberals (dominique angalade) used to be caq's president.

today, the liberals are basically the party of a few different things: immigrants, anglophones, multiculturalism, big business, and....that's pretty much it?  they really don't have a large coalition, and it's hard for them to find a \"wedge issue\" to use against caq right now.  i genuinely don't know how they will expand or what voter groups they will be able to target without losing their current voters.

university students and normally-lefty professionals (who used to vote for them) now will usually just vote for québec solidaire.   which reminds me....

&gt; and then the number 3 and 4 parties whose projected share of the popular vote is greater than the plq are openly separatist.

so this is the weird thing: québec solidaire is technically separatist, but most of their supporters are not.  the last poll i saw was something like ~75% of qs voters would vote against independence if the question were asked tomorrow.

this is because qs is *in theory* in favour of independence, but in reality they only support independence because they're far-left socialists who view canada as a right-wing, colonial state which is an impediment to their communist utopia. they do a lot of crazy stunts, like they refused to take an oath of allegiance to the queen when they were sworn in, most of the men refuse to wear ties, they don't technically have a \"leader\" (because they don't believe in hierarchies) they just have \"spokespeople\" and a \"candidate for premier,\" etc.  because independence is kind of a \"right-wing\" cause right now, most of their members would feel polarized to vote against it.

(as a side note: i find the way that a lot of qs politicians talk in public very...jarring, i guess would be the word.  there's just a certain formal way of speaking in french that most people in public speaking do, but most of them never do it at all.  i suppose the english equivalent would be if you just spoke in vocal fry all the time, and started saying a bunch of \"like\"s and \"totally\"s.  you might talk that way to your friends, but in public it just sounds trashy.  it's very off-putting to a lot of people, but this is appealing to a certain sort of granola-eating left-wing college student who regards it as authentic.)

basically: qs aren't really committed to quebec independence.  they're just far-left crazy people who want a communist state, and only want independence so they can nationalize the banks and burn the queen in effigy.  if that's any more comforting.

but if you mean \"federalism\" as in \"we love and are committed to canada\" rather than \"we're canadian because it benefits us,\" that has never been a majority position here.  so it can't really be \"dead\" if it was never alive to begin with.

&gt; a series of laws over the course of decades that merely recognize the truth of the facts on the ground. quebec will already be gone and we'll just be mopping up the loose ends.

depends on what happens.  but i think that you are right that we need a party that is more ideologically federalist than the caq if we want quebec to stay in canada in the long term.",liberals

conservatives know it doesn't matter what they do, albertans will vote for them; so why should they care? just spark some outrage and the voters will fall in line. pillage the people the rest of the time.

but basically your reasoning comes down to popularity? any time i ask you, you only say “because it’s popular”. we saw in the poll everyone likes to link regarding the “assault weapons” ban that it’s majority popular with those that self-identify having no or little knowledge of firearms and the laws. but then you mock that perspective. do you believe all opinions are equal? i know for a fact you don’t believe that on any other topic (and you’re not wrong there), so why is it an argument point here?

the reason why he gained with both in 2020 is that the electorate shifted somewhat from being divided by race to being divided by education. less educated hispanics and african americans shifted republican in 2020 just as less educated white voters had in 2016. 

there’s a lesson here. the us is different than canada in that it’s immigrants are mostly less educated lower income people. canada with its points system brings in much more educated immigrants. canada is also more educated than the us. 

but, if you could get the canadian electorate to divide itself on education the cpc would win in a landslide. i’m not sure how you would do it. the conservative party in the uk just did this incredibly well and now have a huge majority. but they had the help of brexit and the labour leader siding with the ira when they blew up british soldiers.",conservatives

&gt;ukrainians are white now but were not until the 50s or so. italians, greeks, scots/irish, polish etc etc. there were many ethnic groups that came to canada and within a few generations became ‘white’.

i'm right with you on your second statement, but still hold my original position. for me, \"to be racialized\" is to become aware and think of yourself as a separate race. ethnic japanese people in japan aren't racialized, because they think of \"japanese ethnicity\" and \"japanese identity\" as the same. in contrast, a canadian of british/french/scottish/irish/etc descent, when they think of \"white race\" and \"canadian identity\", thinks of them as different. in the past, they were seemingly identical, but now, they are not, and so people are developing a sense of 'white' racial group identity, perceiving racism against a 'white', and an identity of being 'othered' (e.g. stuff like saying \"dear white people\" and \"white fragility\" and \"white privilege\" - directly being treated/talked about/addressed as a group, that all 'white people' have in common).

&gt;fuck white identity. go buy a kilt and wear it to work. make borscht. embrace and reinvigorate your suppressed cultural heritage.

see, i actually have an issue with that, because it assumes that \"culture\" of a group is something essential. it's traditionalist, in the way that spanish traditionalists appeal to retaining bull-fighting because it's part of their culture. culture is fluid and changing, people nowadays eat pizza, drink bubble tea, watch anime, and listen to rap, and i don't feel like it's inherently 'right' to try to push people to reconstruct or re-adopt things that they don't associate anymore. 

plus there's, a lot of traditional things that people don't care about now, from 99% of western classical music, to beijing opera, to traditional gender roles of a culture. it's okay to want and make a personal choice to practice and perform certain cultural aspects, but we can't force other people to act a certain way and say \"oh a real scottish person wears a kilt and plays bagpipes, you should be more scottish, don't erase your true self!\" there is no \"true\" version or \"right\" way to be a certain culture.",conservatives

however i do understand where the idea is coming from and i know that a lot of older quebecers grew up in the 50-60s and that religion was just plain evil back then.  so their choice i guess.

what i think hurt a lot of us yesterday was how the question was formulated.  she asked thinking she was on the moral high ground and didn’t leave any room for interpretation: she had decided that the law was shit and discriminatory, so please explain yourself.

as a simple analogy, imagine a journalist asking the conservative:

we know alberta is destroying the environment and compromise our future, your party supports that so please explain yourself.

how do tou think it would go? how do you think the west would react?  and then again the analogy isn’t even that good because it doesn’t involve culture and / or prejudice from the past.

as a quebecer i felt betrayed yesterday.  i grew up thinking that canada wasn’t sl bad after all and that we were all a big family.  yesterday i learned that quebec was the unwanted child of that family.  a nuisance.  a stupid child that needs to be educated, because the roc knows better right?",liberals

um, have you forgotten about all the streets with christian based names?'

&gt; the street name still has \"saint\" in front.

so even if he wasn't an official saint, not many people are going to know that, they're just going to see this street named after what reads like a christian icon, and laugh at the idea that quebec is secular.

&gt; furthermore, modern quebec has rejected religion, that doesn't mean we have to throw away our entire history,

when your history, and present are both so permeated with religion, the idea that you've rejected religion is laughable. 

&gt; religion is rejected by a society when religion is seen as private and that it doesn't belong in government.

street names are chosen by governments, so thanks for proving that quebec hasn't rejected religion. there was also a city council (saguenay i think) that started each council meeting with a christian prayer, until they were sued to allow other religions to have prayers as well, and decided that no prayer was better than heathen prayer. again, quebec is christian, you just don't like admitting it.

&gt; you're arguing that religion is still a major factor because the window-dressing is still up.

because what you call window dressing, is part of religious practice, and can't be divorced from that religion so long as it is a practiced religion. if no one in quebec celebrated christmas as the birth of christ, i could agree that it is a secular holiday, but that isn't the case, so as consumeristic as it has because, it is still, also, a religious holiday.",liberals

the trudeau liberals might not be popular, but they're at least less unpopular than everyone else and weren't in much danger of getting less than 145-150 seats in 2019 or 2021. as long as the cpc holds on to it's paleoconservative/reform baggage, the liberals can likely coast off of 30-35% of electoral support to maintain their current legislative position. even if the cpc wins slightly more seats, the ndp or bloc would likely rather hold up the liberals in return for concessions since the current cpc isn't able to work with other parties.  so even under electoral reform, the liberals position is secure so long as the cpc remains dysfunctional and it's reform elements scare potential moderate and swing votes away.

there's real criticism available, especially in the military case where the government hasn't implemented the changes suggested in the reports on changing military culture. falling back on inflammatory lies doesn't solve anything, and just shows opposition is more interested in headlines that actually addressing issues (which military victims themselves even pointed out during committee testimony).",liberals

and yet, here we are with yet *another* scandal(scandlas?) involving the liberal elites and sexism. from 'she experienced it differently', through the claims by caeser-chavannes of sexism by the pmo and pm, to the shocking revalations of gross sexual misconduct in the military over the last 6 years, including these most recent examples, the liberals have made *no concrete effort to live up to their hype*.

and now we have these examples, all happening under the party that cancelled operation honour, and the minister responsible is *still in fucking office* with the pm *still not doing a thing*. 

the minister needs to be removed. under his watch we've seen zero reduction in sexual misconduct, near zero effort to hold senior leaders accountable (with danny fortin being the singluar exception, all the rest personally quitting, and not being fired or forced aside by the minister), and we've seen a massive number of scandals, some of which *directly involve the minister.*

and somehow the cpc isn't correct that the man should be fucking fired for all of these issues. no, no. the cpc is somehow 'slanderin' sajjan. 

and there are people, even here, who think that the issue is not the hypocrisy and cynicism of the governing party, its leader, and the minister responsible, but rather, that hypocrisy of the cpc for not traditionally having the same level of feminism as the liberals at that time.

and beyond creating several different visions of conservatism, the merger also meant internal competition. kenney had to win a leadership race against brian jean, and he played hellishly dirty to do so. there are several former wildrose mlas who endorsed jean over kenney, todd loewen included among them. and if you look closely you can see that loewen's statement against kenney sounds pretty similar to what brian jean has said.

so there's a lot going on here. the immediate story is that loewen said that kenney is unfit to lead and that barnes has been saying similar things for a while. the broader story is about a range of things - kenney's personal unpopularity finally coming to a head with terrible polling for the ucp, a split in the conservatives on how to respond to the pandemic, old disagreements coming back to the forefront, holding together a caucus that was united *against* the ndp as opposed to united around a common ideal, etc.",conservatives

even though i have voted lpc in the past as a strategic vote, i am not an lpc supporter.  i am an ndp supporter and want my leader to do the best for my political party.  this is particularly true in elections like this last one.

when there is a close race between the cpc and the lpc in the country, the ndp usually gets crushed by the lpc in the east and by the cpc in the west.

singh did a good job of preventing that from happening (in the west) while accomplishing something that the ndp has not been able to do in a long time.  he established the ndp as one of the two main choices across most of western canada and picked up additional seats when it was predictable that the cpc would completely dominate the west.  people in central and eastern canada have no idea how deep seated the hatred of trudeau is in much of the west (outside of winnipeg and vancouver).  (it is not so much justin trudeau that they hate.  it is related to how his father treated the west.  perhaps, it is wrong to blame a son for the \"sins\" of his father but there you have it.)  recently, the ndp has become viewed as an ally of the lpc and the cpc tried to use that against the ndp in the west this past election with their advertising. legault did the same with his warning about not voting lpc, ndp or green as if they were one and the same.  if singh would not have been aggressive against trudeau that perception would have been cemented in the eyes of western voters.  as a result, the cpc would have dominated bc and there would have been neither ndp or lpc gains in vancouver/edmonton /calgary.

we often think of the images of pierre trudeau coming to the west and telling farmers that they can sell their own \"damn\" wheat and then literally giving them the finger when they protested.  we also remember him for instituting official bilingualism and destroying the language programs (other than french) throughout our western communities.  he did this without any consultation in our communities.  mandating that french would be taught in all schools led to the destruction of norwegian, ukrainian, russian, german etc. programs which were prominent in many prairie communities.  as a result, those languages were lost and as quebecers know, when a community loses its language, it also loses its culture.  then, he enacted the national energy program that caused financial instability in saskatchewan almost bankrupting the province.  

ndp'ers have a goal to establish the party as the dominant party in some part of the country so that it does not risk extinction in every election.  singh contributed to the eventual achievement of that goal.   he cemented the ndp as the leading party on vancouver island.  he expanded the ndp vote in the lower mainland.  he won an additional seat in edmonton and increased the ndp vote in the city so that the ndp is a contender in several other ridings.  and, he did this at a time when the two main parties were in close competition - past leaders have been unable to do as well in this situation.",liberals

at the time of this comment, a majority is in favour of some kind of electoral reform, and of those strictly in favour of it, a majority want some form of proportional representation. 

it's a commonly used counter point to advocates of electoral reform: claiming that there is common-ground on the issue. every government committee tasked with studying the issue has recommended pr. a handful of referenda won a majority in favour of electoral reform, but were arbitrarily rejected. change is warranted.",conservatives
