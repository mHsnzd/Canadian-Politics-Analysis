what i'm saying is that canada is in practice, basically a resource colony—just one with multiple foreign majority-shareholder clients, rather than a single controlling empire. the corporations that extract resources for export here, are mostly canadian *subsidiaries* of the *foreign* companies that *import* those resources. their policies are set by their foreign owners.

and the government of canada can't push too hard on these foreign companies to change how they do things here, because the governments under which those foreign companies exist are—in aggregate—a lot more powerful than canada's government, *and* benefit greatly from having the externalities of their large corporations' resource-extraction efforts hidden behind a political border where their own citizens won't see them.

canada's economic model is pretty much unchanged from the days where the english-owned hudson's bay company \"was\" the government, and the resource being extracted was furs.

entrepreneurial, well educated, with skills that fit the job market and a good command of english or french, immigrants today are better equipped than ever to integrate successfully into our economy and society. such immigrants are likely to believe that people can and should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, just as they did.”

when the new wave hit india, their politicians and doctors were saying that they believed that enough people had been exposed to covid to have the antibodies (over 50% of the population) but then the spread started happen and they realized that regardless  of their so called herd immunity, it had little to no effect on the new variants (double and triple mutants) and really did nothing atall to slow them down. 

that's what i was saying but in a more dramatic way for effect.

so i think you took what i wrote a bit to literal my friend.

my main point is you have 2 polar opposite examples, new zealand and india. one did everything right, and it worked exactly how you would expect. the other took a laxed approach, didn't really take it that seriously overall... politicians were very eager to open the economy up and get things rolling... jumped the gun and now they are the hardest hit by far during this entire pandemic. the lessons are there and very clear. cause and effect.

this isn't about opinion. covid could care less about that, either you take it fully serious and stop it by limiting travel, closing boarders, making check points, getting people to follow all the rules... not just a couple people, everyone... and you will succeed (like new zealand) or, do what we have been doing... play to business over people, don't really enforce anything, take an overall laxed approach and bam! covid will just keep being a problem.

and this isn't a game where the world can just keep going into new lockdowns forever, eventually if covid is allowed to keep spreading through countries who don't stricktly take it very serious, sooner or later a mutation will happen (if it hasn't already) that will be immune to the vaccines, and if that happens... its already too late for everyone.... based on mr. ford's wording to trudeau, i am pretty confident that mutation has already occurred in india. if thats the case, we are in for the fight of all our lives, and we are not nearing the end of this.

sorry for all the edits op. seriously. 

one last thing, if you look at the variants as we have discovered them on a timeline, you will see a clear trend of them becoming more resistant to antibodies, more deadly, and attacking new age groups who haven't been vaccinated. this is a 📈 graphable trend that is continuously trending worse. there are lots of mutations that don't take hold, but the ones that do get worse everytime. this is playing with fire, the longer its allowed to happen because sooner or later one will arrive that has the ability to infect even those that are vaccinated. if that happens, it's over... not just for us, for the entire world. back to square one with no ammo to fight.",liberals

* williams’ bombast wasn’t enough to generate the $6.2 billion that it was initially supposed to cost. he needed federal help, which prime minister stephen harper obligingly pledged at a time when he was facing re-election, eventually producing a $5-billion loan guarantee.
* when justin trudeau succeeded harper as prime minister, his liberals guaranteed another $2.9 billion, meaning ottawa — or, more accurately, canadian taxpayers — were on the hook for $7.9 billion for a project that was supposed to cost almost $2 billion less than that. even then, it was obvious that the project would prove to be the horror story many had predicted.
* “they seem to be living in some sort of alternate universe,” said ron penney, a member of the muskrat falls concerned citizens coalition, in march 2020, after a formal inquiry catalogued the many missteps that had pushed the project’s price tag, at that point, to $12.7 billion. newfoundland’s justice minister, declaring himself “pissed off” at the vastness of the ineptitude, sent the report to police to consider criminal charges.
* even with more help for muskrat falls — ottawa agreed to provide $5.2 billion towards costs now calculated at $13.1 billion — newfoundland’s books remain in alarming shape, with debt servicing costs swallowing more cash than anything outside of health care. a poll in january found that more than half the province’s residents expect it to go bankrupt within a few years.
* meanwhile, two timely reports underlined just how dangerous canada’s own finances have become. the parliamentary budget officer estimated it could be 50 years before ottawa balances a budget, if it fails to alter its spending habits. at the same time, the c.d. howe institute warned that the “sensitivity and fragility” of canada’s fiscal position means even a slight change in growth could set off a debt bomb.",liberals

albertans have a 100 year history of going against the canadian mainstream. if cpc vote evaporates and goes ndp that might just be a continuation of the same trend. it is, after all, a prairie protest party in origins, just one with more success than the older reform and social credit parties in going national (and staying alive).

saskatchewan’s big change (and this goes for alberta and manitoba too) is the end of the small family farm. there’s not many farmers left, (but a lot of people who identify with them), and they are all big business owners now. this is likely why the rural ridings have gone from blue/orange to solid blue over time.

the oil industry is epically conservative, probably most of any industry in canada. as an outsider, it looks like most other sectors are aligned with the liberals now, but this one is still offside as it were. however, they’ve haemorrhaged hundreds of thousands of workers, and the loyalty to the industry and party seems to be ending.",liberals

yes - tam says 75 percent - of adults, the figures you're looking at for the us and isreal are total population. including kids. there's a big difference. they are pretty close to 70 percent for adults. 

moreover they're damn near as far along for the second shot - 36 percent or so of their entire population in the states. we're at 2 percent.  so  it's not quite the comparison you think it is for the us vs what tam wants. 

second - that's just a recommendation. they don't actually get any say in it - the provinces will decide what they do independently. so it's in tam's interest to be on the cautiuos side becuase if the provinces don't go with that then she can say 'well - we did tell you to go slower' and blame everything on the provinces. which is what they've done so far. 

they don't want to 'control' you - they just don't want covid to end. if it ends, they can't justify their insane spending in the 'name of covid'. if it ends then they have to start producing results on getting us back on track and facing the debt they've created. it means people will focus on the other things they're doing - and it means that their political rivals can start getting out there and campaigning and building support the old fashioned way, which is the last thing they want.

affirmative action helps create opportunities for disadvantaged groups. equality that pays no mind to the differences in circumstances of historically marginalized people's is no equality at all. it always results in more discrimination.

also, stricter punishments for crime does not deter crime. there is tons and tons of social science evidence to this effect, largely in the american context, where governments love those types of policies. stricter punishments are disproportionately applied to bipoc and do not to stop crime. investment in social services and communities is required to do that. the best way to reduce crime is to create economic security in disadvantaged communities.

which means we need to spend more money--not less--on these and newer programs. at the minimum we must maintain the level of spending. reducing social supports, which are always the first to be cut when people start talking about debt or expenditure reduction, will lead to more crime, not less because they destoryed the security of disadvantaged communities. this also means slower economic growth and participation by these communities.

why lower population growth? canadian population growth has been on average 1% over the last 30 years. we aren't growing particularly fast at all. unless you just mean you want fewer immigrants? which is want conservatives usually mean when they say that, which is in line with the current conservative party.

the report comes from the \"[u.s.-based centre for the study of partisanship and ideology\"](https://cspicenter.org/), formed in 2020. their *about us* features a board staffed by academics, which is encouraging even allowing that most are phd *candidates*. if there is any information on their funding, i missed it.

i don't get a non-partisan vibe from them though. more enlightened centrist/right-wing-with-a-wig. frequent mentions of the \"great awokening\", reference to the left pulling away from the right as the driver behind current populism, and a very sanitized depiction of american right-wing politics in their only other released report.

from the article:

&gt;a report released this week shows clear evidence of a significant political slant in canadian (along with american and british) universities. the report finds that 73 per cent of canadian social science and humanities academics identify as being on the left, compared to just four per cent who identify with the right. this makes universities substantially more politically skewed than the general population.

that might have something to do with the right wing having been wrong on every social issue in recent history. trans rights, gay rights, the war on drugs, desegregation and interracial marriage, universal suffrage... and those are just the highlights that come to mind.

the [report's](https://cspicenter.org/reports/academicfreedom/) underlying thesis seems entirely based on the idea that academia should be a reflection of demographics at large, that *both sides* have contributions of equal value to make and are deserving of equal support. some highlights:

&gt;over 4 in 10 us and canadian academics would not hire a trump supporter, and 1 in 3 british academics would not hire a brexit supporter.

&gt;gender-critical feminist scholars appear to experience even more discrimination than conservatives. only 28% of american and canadian academics would feel comfortable having lunch with someone who opposes the idea of transwomen accessing women’s shelters.",conservatives

seems like it, liberalism is designed to fail. its weak, and only held up by few values.

lets for example examine zoophilia

any normal person would say that this is degenerate and evil. they will have no rational argument necessarily for that bias. but it exists, it exists for a reason, in built-in us. when we talk about sex what would a liberal vs conservative have as requirements for sex. lets take an very conservative vs very liberal outlook

&amp;#x200b;

conservative: you must be married, you must do it with the opposite sex, only in order to have a child, and do it with concent

liberal: you just need concent

&amp;#x200b;

now lets say \"science\" found out that dogs can give concent, where does the liberal stand? where does the conservative stand? the conservative  is on safe ground, but the liberal only becomes a bigot if they say \"zoophilia is still bad\"

&amp;#x200b;

so if science evolved to this point, how low will society go? how much will we be willing to endure? what is next?

to compensate civilizations tend to try to control elements of it with more laws and regulation - hate speech goes from \"advocating violence or crime\" to \"just being hateful towards something\" to \"i don't like what you said\".  morality tends to go from highly structured (chew with your mouth closed and wear appropriate clothing) to no structure (throw up in public and go naked). rights tend to be less about the individual and more about the 'society', which is odd as the purpose of creating a society is usually to protect and define the rights of the individual.

in the end societies cease to be a true ethos, and they just become a bunch of people with no connection living in the same geographical area, until an outside force takes over or influences them to recreate their society (taliban anyone?)

i will also add that opposition parties have been staking several campaigns to allege questionable or unethical behavior by the pm and key ministers since the last election. if those attacks were justified, this is the opposition parties' opportunity to make the case to canadians to strip the government of power. if those attacks were not justified, this is the government's opportunity to stop arbitrary and obstructionist proceedings from interfering with governing in the midst of an emergency.",liberals

the good:

-i agree with trudeau's comment about canadians not being able to properly vote in 2019 for which party had the best pandemic plan. granted, covid was not as massive of a concern at the time of the election. this does give us a chance to pick which we see have had the best ideas.

-i am happy any time the cpc loses seats to the ndp or libs, we end up in better positions when we do. according to polls, that will happen. it's not a bad thing based on how the cpc are acting and behaving. their recent ad is turning off the more moderate cpc voter.

the bad:

-which the 4th wave looming, provinces dropping restrictions, and not enough people fully vaccinated... i am concerned about the safety of the voting stations. with a 36 days campaign i hope there is enough time to get mail-in voting happening, as well as opening early voting stations earlier. i don't know if this is the right time to do this, when on a federal level things have been working very well. the lib/ndp cooperation has been a strong mix.

-for some, the pandemic spending is going to be an issue brought up. however, sane people will understand this was not an extravagant binge spending spree. this was to bail out canadians in a time of need. i fully expect the cpc to try and use this, but i am concerned that singh will go down that road. which i think would be the wrong call. singh needs to focus on what he would do and get thst message out. i am concerned he is going to try some of the same mudslinging that the cpc does.

the neutral:

-we may see no green party representation in a long time. which the party imploding and the public display of infighting, it's giving canadians a sour taste. however, this is from their own doing.

1) it's not a \"cpc is right wing extremist\" issue. the bloc and the green, both generally left-wing parties, also do not have this policy. this might be because the ndp was also campaigning early, so maybe they and the liberals were the only ones who found out about the early election. the other parties can't force candidates to vaccinate to go to rallies or it'll waste precious campaigning time. plus the cpc banned a candidate for being anti-public health measures.

a statement from the government might mean nothing to you, but i'm sure there are muslims who would feel reassured that their government is taking an official stance against hatred towards them.

and studying islamophobia is crucial if you want to actually do something about it. sure, a study won't solve it... but it could give the government information that would help them combat it.

a single individual could take violent action, inspired by hate and fear, without any sort of organizational support, and still be a part of a philosophy which could be called \"terrorism\" imo.

&gt;members of the ontario covid-19 science  advisory table said there are three policies that mr. ford could enact  immediately that would save lives: the increased redirection of vaccines  to covid-19 hot spots, particularly in the greater toronto area; the  provision of paid sick days; and a narrower definition of an essential  business  
&gt;  
&gt;the  globe and mail spoke with more than half a dozen members of the  advisory table during the weekend and all expressed dismay with the  government’s actions. several say they considered resigning in protest,  but feared the move would only worsen the government’s next steps.  
&gt;  
&gt;peter  juni, the scientific director of the table, said he was “at a loss”  trying to understand why the provincial government announced a suite of  measures that didn’t account for his group’s advice.  
&gt;  
&gt;nathan stall, a physician and the  assistant scientific director of the table’s secretariat, said he was  dumbfounded by the government’s rejection of science and common sense.  
&gt;  
&gt;andrew  morris, an infectious-disease specialist and also a member of the  table, said his reaction friday was a mixture of shock, disbelief, anger  and sadness.  
&gt;  
&gt;alison thompson, a  member of the ontario covid-19 health system response bioethics table,  another group advising the ford government, said she and her colleagues  were stunned, especially by the absence of enhanced protections for  essential workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;“it was probably one of the lowest points in my career. it was hard not to quit,” dr. thompson said.  
&gt;  
&gt;dr.  morris added the government’s small steps to correct themselves during  the weekend shouldn’t distract from their failure to implement the  policies that could alleviate the crisis.  
&gt;  
&gt;“we need a government that will listen to science,” dr. morris said.  
&gt;  
&gt;behavioural  scientist laura desveaux, a member of the science table, said she felt  angry and deflated to learn of the measures on friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;“i  started to reflect on what were the restrictions that were announced  and, benefit of the doubt, how could that link back to the evidence that  was presented? and some of it clearly didn’t,” she said.

if only confined to one province, they cannot do without the confirmation of that province, as described in 14(2). (fyi - \"lieutenant governor in council\" is another name for the provincial cabinet). 

even if this clause wasn't there, trudeau's own father already set the precedent (quebec 1970) that it cannot be used without request of the province, and under our common law legal system, precedent and unwritten law has as much influence as the written law.

the green's weakness generally was that they were effectively the elizabeth may party. the party's bases/sub-factions were so wildly at odds with each other that there was no way that they could share a party with each-other over the long-haul. you had disenfranchised liberal &amp; ndp voters who wanted the party to be everything that their parties weren't under their current leadership, you had environmentally minded centrist red and blue tories that were probably at home back in the mulroney/campbell days, but are currently homeless. then on top of those factions, you also had the fringe/tinfoil hat people (anti-fluoridation, anti-vaccination, anti-gmo, anti-nuclear etc.) a lot, if not all of which probably went over to the ppc because of their anti-vaxx policies (and possibly for some of their racist/borderline-racist policies/dog-whistling as well.)

you put that all together, you have a party that is fundamentally at odds with itself/not structurally sound. what a better leader could have done was give the fringe votes the door and try and adopt the best aspects from each of it's bases on social, economic and environmental policy while listening to the experts and play off electoral discontent to build the green's brand. make the party more third-way/ pro-market than the ndp, more progressive than the liberals and significantly less angry/contrarian than the cpc and you might be able to tap into something that a lot of the electorate is feeling  and build off of that. (the ppc \"could\" have went that route as well by moving to the centre on social &amp; climate policy, but bernier opted to go full fringe instead).

obviously that's not what paul did, but even if somebody tried to just emulate may all over again hoping for the same results or if the new leaders goal was simply to supplant the ndp as the new leftist party, all of that would have went far better internally and externally for the gpc than what happened under paul.",liberals

nothing wrong with focusing on those, i think the greens have always struggled to really make their non-climate focused views and policy goals understood in a convincing way. so i understand why she would choose to try and broaden what the party stands for in the minds of most canadians. but the climate crisis message was largely lost in the shuffle of all the other things that were going on with her campaign.

but i honestly don't think the greens are going to become more influential as more and more parties prioritise the climate crisis. perpetually winning 1-2 seats and competing in a handful of ridings across the country doesn't seem sustainable to me.

i think of the greens and ndp merged, and actually took the best ideas from both parties/teams, we could have a much stronger left wing coalition to push the liberals with.

the schisms in the party were obviously bubbling under the surface anyway, and paul's disastrous response to the zatzman issue shows a real unfitness for leadership. but both of those issues (which are definitely real and important) could have been worked on outside of the public eye. maybe if they had, things would have been different. particularly if trudeau had held off an election call for another, say, year. they could have kept fredericton and nanaimo, maybe still added kitchener and - who knows? - actually flipped toronto centre. let's not forget she *did* come in second in the by-election.

i'm not saying zatzman is responsible for everything that went wrong. clearly party brass *did* engage in sabotage, and clearly paul herself *did* make monumental and inexcusable mistakes. she is now falling on her sword, as she is duty-bound to do. there *is* no other way out of this. failing to win toronto centre is one thing, but coming *fifth* in the riding you've spent the whole campaign on is a very specific rejection of paul herself.

i want to say that as an ndp partisan, i ought to be gloating at the greens' failure. i should be saying, \"good riddance\" in hopes that if they fade away, the ndp could walk away with half of their vote or so... but i'm really not. i get no pleasure from the greens' misfortune, nor from paul's personal misfortune. everybody in the greens, from leader on down, are just people who want what's best for the country and for the world. and so do i, so i wish tuem well and hope they gwt through this and can move on.",liberals

gwe004s,2021-04-29T14:33:36.000-07:00,"pro-life or pro-choice &gt;one thing we should all recognise is that abortion is a very emotionally process, mothers are not having abortion all willy nilly.

it is emotional for some mothers but certainly not all. 

&gt;they are the victims on the situation too. even if a person didnt practice safe sex, they shouldn't have the entire course of their life altered forcefully by a government. 

conservatives believe in personal responsibility. people often cheat because of some emotional reason. does that mean they shouldn't pay the consequences? people often break the law for emotional reasons. hit and run could be due to spontaneous emotional reaction after the accident. does that mean they shouldn't be punished? 

&gt;for me, saying that is like saying smokers who contract lung cancer deserve whatever happens to them because \"they chose to smoke, or should have known better\"

the difference is that smokers with lung cancer get treatment which does not harm anyone. abortion is ending a life of a living being. 

&gt;entire course of their life altered forcefully by a government. 

no they shouldn't. this is the only good point you make in my opinion. now, they could just give birth to this baby and then leave it for adoption. but we already have too many children without parents. that is my reason for supporting abortion on conditions.",conservatives

while i don't think dictionaries have the exhaustive list of definitions for a word, and thus shouldn't be used to try to prove a word doesn't have an additional meanings.  i couldn't help, but notice that the cambridge dictionary even recognizes that central doesn't always need to refer to the geographic centre.

central: \"in, at, from, or near the centre or most important part of something\"

fyi i'm not from ontario or quebec, so i definitely don't think either is the centre of the universe lol

but you are right, i should leave this here.  sorry for trying to clear up a point of confusion for you.

edit: thought the person was trolling, now i am convinced.  they don't respond to the points i made, just more deflection and goal post shifting (shifting from central canada isn't a term to describe ontario and quebec to doesn't match the definition of centre).  also i did respond to the colloquial comment by giving non-colloquial examples of centre being used to mean something other than the geographic centre, for example, centre of population is commonly used technical term).

apparently they recieved something like 100,000 forms back.  basically an insignificant number, all things considered, and the results were 50/50 in terms of fptp and pr. 

given there was no clear majority of what to change and how to change it, it was probably a good thing it wasn't followed through on.
