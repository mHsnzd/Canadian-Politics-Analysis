a few notes:

- what they say they‚Äôll do doesn‚Äôt necessarily match what they‚Äôll do

- eventually a conservative government will get elected, whatever changes they can‚Äôt make now, they‚Äôll make next time. 

- i welcome subsidies to childcare. but things are ‚Äúok and not perfect‚Äù now and will be ‚Äúok but not perfect‚Äù with subsidies to childcare. it‚Äôs a good idea that will probably help canadians who need help. but we‚Äôve gone a long time without it; it‚Äôs hardly panacea; and if it‚Äôs so damn important to the trudeau liberals, they‚Äôd have done it already. 

- petro points is a dumb idea. agreed. if we have a shot at tackling climate crises, it will be through lpc style carbon taxes. *and* only if they actually begin to tax it to a point where people need to make decisions rather than just bitching. and only if we talk the usa and china and india into joining our efforts. i‚Äôm not comforted by self-masturbatory theatrics. 

there‚Äôs nothing that is so imminent that we *must* vote liberal. o‚Äôtoole is every bit as putsy as trudeau‚Ä¶ but neither are a demagogue. anything they do will be undone by the next pm unless we establish a more robust parliament at the expense of the pmo and executive. the idea that ‚Äòa better pm‚Äô will solve these problems is incoherent. 

and, ultimately, neither will change the structure of government. so it matters little to me what promises they make - they aren‚Äôt in it for us.",liberals

nearly everyone who is an expert in climate policy in canada has rated the liberal plan tops. great ambition, builds on the pan-canadian framework, and outlines specific measures to reach the 40-45 per cent by 2030 ghg reduction. also, the liberal plan has been independently verified and modeled, like the cpc's. the ndp plan is just bullets on a list.

&gt;the cpc is stuck in a rut because it refuses to change. it can either expand its base by moderating on social and climate issues,or the socons can keep holding the party hostage and subside off the toned down table scraps from the republican down south.   the issue with both o'toole and scheer is that they've kept the party in limbo rather than coming up with their own policies.

in thinking about this, the circumstances that brought about harper were incredibly unique: he literally unified the party, and ruled as such. no future conservative will get to shape the party's direction - and as a result, the country - the way harper did, just as no future conservative will be able to silence an increasingly-vocal socon base. 

the conservative leadership selection process is so broken (or so democratic, depending on how you look at it) that it leads to this nightmare, where leaders are determined based on their ability to sway social conservative votes. scheer was put into power by being the second choice of trost voters, and mackay was no lewis or sloan voter's second choice. the social conservative wing of the party, which is anywhere from 25-35%, is acting as king maker. ironically, it is also destroying the party's electability.",conservatives

i recognize that the government has handled the pandemic well, but in the context of the top issues of bc, housing affordability and homelessness, the government has been *terrible* these last few years and trudeau deserves a thrashing. 

the government inherited a housing crisis already underway in 2015 and things only got worse as the government did little. 

similarly the toxic drug crisis was also not dealt with, with the recommendations of dr. henry ignored, and thousands have died, with five bcians dying every day from this. 

vancouverites have seen on the ground throughout this pandemic how much worse poverty has become in vancouver.

what the un report alarm bells are telling us is that this is all hands on deck time and a time for severe action. it's not a time for a \"balanced\" approach.

gigmxhb,2021-01-07T04:09:35.000-08:00,"canada pm trudeau expresses concern about violence in washington so, i think there are a few points you don't understand about power and international relations.

first, power is relative. allowing another actor to enhance their power weakens all others. 

if you look at the great wars of history, *all* of them have been fought over this very principle, and many of them were initiated over minor territories. large coalitions frequently emerge to stop the expansionist aims of aggressor states. 

-the italian wars were fought to stop france from becoming hegemonic in italy. 

-the thirty years war saw france joining the protestant powers in order to stop spanish hegemony over europe. 

-the war of spanish succession was fought to stop the french from picking up the remains of the spanish empire. 

-the war of austrian succession was fought over a prussian attempt to seize silesia.

-the revolutionary and napoleonic wars were an attempt to stop revolutionary france from gaining hegemony over europe.

-the world wars were fought to stop two german bids for continental domination, after germany gave its closest ally permission to invade serbia (wwi) or after germany invaded poland (wwii). 

-and then there are all of the wars of the cold war and thereafter fought to prevent the expansion of communist bloc (e.g. korea, vietnam), or to prevent iraq from gaining control over the bulk of mid-east oil (the gulf war). 

-indeed, the united states today is committed to the defence of estonia, ukraine (not with an alliance, but with aid), and taiwan. america isn't there because those places are strategically important, it's because it's easier to draw a line now than after russian/chinese expansion occurs.

second, the us is less powerful than it seems. yes, the us has a large military presently. but much of that involves obsolete and expensive capabilities - aircraft carriers that can be taken out by relatively cheap missiles. moreover, nobody is on a war footing at present - the us spends 3.4% of gdp on its military, the europeans much less. but the size of each respective economy is comparable. 

third, power is structural. the united states is powerful today because it controls the global reserve currency. the us can borrow money in its own currency - something no other state can do. but that power depends on cooperation from other states. as the us shifts toward being an authoritarian regime, its structural power will wane as america's enablers seek other options. it's happening already. the eurozone just created a eurobond. the leaders of the uk, australia, new zealand and the conservative leader in canada all support creating canzuk, a new trade/migration pact. some us allies, like the philippines, are aligning more closely with china. 

fourth, there are almost always bargaining alternatives that are superior to war because war is costly. the us doesn't get much out of invading canada - it is far easier to threaten and gain concessions from canada. however, the more the us exploits canada, the more canada could gain by seeking other partnerships, or other options. 

fifth, canada was part of the manhattan project, we had nuclear weapons as recently as 1984, and we have one of the most advanced nuclear industries in the world. we could develop nuclear weapons in a few years if we had to. second strike capability might be harder to develop, but as long as there was some risk that attacking canada could involve a nuclear attack, there would be a deterrent effect. what is more, the threat that we could develop nuclear weapons might convince others that it would be better to protect us with their own nuclear umbrella. 

sixth, it doesn't matter if the us has more warheads than the europeans (or even canada). either would have the ability to inflict unacceptable casualties on the other. 

so, why might the eu defend canada? for reasons stemming from all of the principles i just highlighted. defending canada would:

1. contain american expansion. 
2. be more feasible than it seems presently (especially as european military spending would increase as the us lurched toward authoritarianism). 
3. make the eu credible as a great power patron to others.
4. help enhance the structural power of the eu (while diminishing that of the united states). 
5. prevent canada from developing its own nuclear arsenal. 

and hell, if the europeans don't do it, the chinese or russians will.",liberals

i think your missing the fact that america is already the world hegemonic power and is the only nation on the planet able to project power to any place it desires. those wars were fought in a time when armies marched and travelled by horseback. america today can level most of a countries infrastructure without a single american soldier stepping on foreign soil. you can't contain a country if you can't attack them and no other nation other than russia(barely at that) has this kind of ability. america literally has the ability to strike anywhere on the planet within 24hrs, that's a huge advantage.

&gt;second, the us is less powerful than it seems. yes, the us has a large military presently. but much of that involves obsolete and expensive capabilities - aircraft carriers that can be taken out by relatively cheap missiles. 

i'm not sure what us military you are looking at but let's look at a few of pieces of equipment.

f-22 and f-35 5th gen fighters: no other country is fielding a true fifth gen fighter at the moment, can engage any other fighter without ever being detected.

b-2 spirit bomber: the most advanced bomber on the planet, no country has successfully incepted a b-2 yet and the it's successor the b-21 raider will be a virtual blackhole to modern radar. these bombers could invade your air space and the only reason you'd know they were there is after things start exploding.

us carriers 10 nimitz class and 1 ford class: these carriers combined have larger air forces than most other nations combined. they are vulnerable to missile attack but you can't kill what you can't get close too and the american are going to make this an a very difficult task.

abrams m1a2 mbt: the most advanced battle proven tank on the planet at the moment, it's predecessor the m1 and m1a1 destroyed the iraqi feared tank corps in less than 100hrs.

&gt;canada was part of the manhattan project, we had nuclear weapons as recently as 1984, and we have one of the most advanced nuclear industries in the world.

we had american warheads owned and developed by the americans, we did work on the manhattan project in the 40's but those weapons were basic fission based devices and nothing like today's modern fusion devices. the idea that we could develop warheads in secret without the americans finding and removing them from us is ridiculous.  

&gt;and hell, if the europeans don't do it, the chinese or russians will.

those countries are more likely to sit back and use the chance to seize land then to come to our aid. neither country really has the ability to project power and would sit on the sidelines while the us fashions it's next group of states.",liberals

&gt; it shall be lawful for the queen, by and with the advice and consent of the senate and house of commons, to make **laws** for the peace, order, and good government of canada

note, the constitution allows the federal government to make laws for pogg purposes - not take whatever actions it chooses in defiance of laws for pogg purposes.

the emergencies act cited by u/ontmodsridyuts is clearly a pogg law. 

the federal parliament could written the law differently, but it chose to pass a statute that requires the governor general in council (e.g., the feds in their executive capacity) to receive consent from the provincial government in their executive capacity to invoke this statute in respect to only one province. 

just because the federal *parliament* has the constitutional power to make laws in relation to pogg does *not* mean that the federal *cabinet* can ignore laws duly passed by parliament in the name of pogg.

if the government wished to invoke with respect to the entire country, they could do so without provincial consultation, per the act. however, that is not mr. singh's proposal that op was discussing the constitutional merits of. 

your dismissive tone towards their [~~his~~ i don't know op's gender - that was sloppy] well reasoned analysis of the statute, a rarity on reddit, is unwarranted. 

as to unwritten constitutional principles which form part of the canadian constitution, i might refer you to the supreme court of canada on this topic in *quebec secession reference* [1998] 2 s.c.r. 217 at para. 54:

&gt; these principles may, in certain circumstances, give rise to substantive legal obligations, which constitute substantive limitations upon government action. these principles may give rise to very abstract and general obligations, or they may be more specific and precise in nature. the principles are not merely descriptive, but are also invested with a powerful normative force, and are binding upon both courts and governments.

the department of justice has a very useful primer for beginners and laypersons that includes a section on unwritten principles in our constitution:

https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art522.html

while the common law does not normally trump statute law, of course, certain unwritten principles *do* limit what laws the government may pass or actions it may take in our constitutional system, which op characterises as a common law constitutional system - perhaps not entirely accurately given that our constitutional system is a hybrid of mostly written law and common law constitutional principles.",liberals

he gave you an example: christy clark.

the premier is the person chosen by the lieutenant governor to manage the gov't of a province for the queen.

traditionally, that person is the leader of the party with the most seats in the legislature but it's not **mandatory**. 

they don't even have to have a seat in the legislature (i.e. they don't need to be elected).

they could, theoretically, be bob on the street.

if doug ford resigns, he would probably resign as premier and as chief of the party. the conservatives would choose a new chief (choosing him/her by whatever means they want, including elections within the party) and this person would in all likelihood be the new premier.

if biden isn't willing to do that i don't think there's much point to being the odd man out, especially if we have any hope of getting the michaels out.

more broadly though if we step out of this olympics i'd actually recommend trying to break the back of the olympics as currently practiced. the ancient olympics had one tradition that actually gave the event the meaning that would make all the spectacle warranted, the olympic truce. needless to say that hasn't been carried over to the modern olympics though there was some effort to revive it but if we're going to start taking moral stances again with the olympics lets take it seriously and through to conclusion.

1. can't participate in the olympics if you're at war, yes that means you usa, if you can't manage with your trillions in weaponry to garner a truce then no laurels for you.

2. can't participate in the olympics if you're up to anything on the ethnic cleanse to genocide spectrum, yes that means you china.

in large part, you seem to be conflating voting partnerships with coalitions. one is temperamental and often done on a case-by-case basis, while the other is an agreement to form government, share cabinet, and make legislation in a joint effort.

canada isn't india. we have more capacity in our healthcare system.  we've been able to impose and enforce restrictions better.  and we're vaccinating faster than them.  citing india to maintain lockdowns is pure fearmongering.

sure.  but over 80% of our vaccinations will be mrna in the end.  and to date those have shown more effectiveness against all variants.  at least enough to prevent the hospitals from getting overloaded, which was the entire point of the lockdowns.

it's about risk management.  we can't stay locked up indefinitely either.  once we have enough people vaccinated to reduce the hospital workload, it'll be time to move on.  and thats what people need to keep in mind with all this.  we didn't confine ourselves to stay safe.  we did to prevent our healthcare system from collapsing. and it's looking like the vaccines will help us succeed in that goal.",liberals

from a liberal's point of view he really has pulled off an amazing feat of squelching all internal opposition and creating the \"one party\", as it was branded. as wells points out, this has basically never happened since, i dunno, mackenzie-king probably.

as wells also observes, he has done it by showing the door to most of the voices for what a former boss used to call \"healthy friction\". there is no one left in the liberal party with the power, personality, or platform to stand up to trudeau.

it seems to be working for him and them, but the problem with eliminating internal opposition is it leads to and entrenches group think and the cult of the leader. those rarely lead to a happy outcome in the end. 

there are a couple of folks left in caucus - nathaniel erskine-smith and terry beech come to mind - who have successfully taken positions contrary to the government, but i get the impression that is because of the political reality in their ridings, and that they were given permission to deviate rather than their constituting any sort of internal challenge.",liberals

first, its a keen example of our intellectual impoverishment as a society. we've come to the point where [racism = bad] is flipped to [bad = racism]. our understanding of history has become so shallow that we cannot imagine any other metric than racism by which to evaluate discriminatory policy or outcomes, leading to outright absurdities like this professor's charge that legault is a white supremacist (!) 

the charge that legault is a white supremacist is patently absurd. 

yes, quebec suffers from systemic racism - after all, canada suffers from layers of systemic racism that permeate all of our society and societies, including quebec. pretending that quebec is unique in this is bizarre and discriminatory. 

however, it is not the only challenge we face - though our narrow focus has led to us purging our historical education of reference to any of these historical challenges, leading to their triumphant reemergence. 

if anything, legault's government is sectarian. this is hardly new - either in quebec, canada or the world. quebec and canada have had numerous sectarian governments and policies over the years, part of the long western tradition of sectarianism that has been at the root of hundreds of years of war and suffering, including anti-quebecois discrimination, the basis of which was anti-catholicism. 

quebec is not alone in this. ontario retains sectarian discriminatory policy in the form of its catholic school system, for example. 

however, since its passe to speak of such things, we're forced to watch tortured attempts to explain our sectarianism is really racism, because a professor (!) cannot imagine a way in which \"bad\" can be anything other than \"racist\". 

also, lets not pretend that a ltc or hospital advertising for \"whites only\" in quebec makes quebec or legault especially racist. first, these ads didn't come about because of some law legault passed - its root is that a racist lady is in cognitive decline and alzheimer's can lead to violent tantrums. ontario has an exception in its human rights code for personal-care work for this very reason. in ontario, its entirely lawful for an elderly or disabled person to set racist standards for their psws. so an ontarian pretending that legault is racist for not immediately stamping down on a practice that appears to have a lawful analogue in ontario is.... unfortunate.",liberals

no, it doesn't. there's absolutely no legal basis to the suggestion that it does.

&gt;you can thank the provinces whining after the last time the war measures act was used for that.

you're the only one talking about the war measures act (which, by the way, was repealed decades ago). the pogg power is constitutional in nature, not legislative.

&gt;there is no legal mechanism for the federal government to unilaterally assume provincial powers as would have been needed for a competent national response to covid.

please don't speak so authoritatively about things you clearly don't understand.

&gt;in exceptional circumstances, the¬†federal government¬†may invoke a state of emergency. (see also¬†emergency preparedness.) this grants¬†parliament¬†special powers. these powers allow the federal government to infringe on provincial jurisdiction when the country is facing an existential crisis. such emergency powers are only to last as long as the emergency itself.

this was confirmed most recently by the supreme court in the reference re greenhouse gas pollution pricing act where it was noted that:

&gt;in the¬†reference re anti‚Äëinflation act,¬†1976 canlii 16 (scc),¬†[1976] 2 s.c.r. 373, beetz j., whose judgment on this point commanded majority support, reviewed the extensive jurisprudence on the subject **and concluded that the peace, order and good government power should be confined to justifying (i) temporary legislation dealing with a¬†national emergency¬†(p.¬†459)** and (ii)¬†legislation dealing with ‚Äúdistinct subject matters which do not fall within any of the enumerated heads of s.¬†92 and which, by nature, are of national concern‚Äù¬†(p.¬†457).

(my emphasis)

indeed, several academics, as well as judges of the provincial courts of appeal that heard the case, suggested that the national emergencies branch was actually a better fit to authorize the carbon tax than the national concern branch was.

so, yes, there absolutely is a legal mechanism for the federal government to temporarily legislate within provincial jurisdiction for the life of the emergency, and no, it doesn't rely on either the war measures act (which was repealed in 1988), or the emergencies act. it arises from residual jurisdiction passed to the federal government at the time of confederation through the constitution act of 1867.",liberals

and i don‚Äôt believe king is one of the worst, but i certainly would not defend him as some magnificent leader either. much of the good that came out of his government was only as a result of more progressive ministers fighting hard for years for shift in polices and the progressive party‚Äôs demands for supporting his governments in the 1920s. so, i don‚Äôt know what you mean by preventing a third party from forming because they existed and provided his government with supply and confidence in exchange for movement on their social welfare agenda for the entire decade. and then again in 1945 when the party did implement some major aspects of the ccf platform to maintain public support in the post war era.

and just a note on the referendum, i think you‚Äôre confusing the wwi crisis with the wwii one. king, for some reason, actually believed that all nine provinces would vote in favour of releasing the government from their pledge to not introduce conscription. of course, he was sorely mistaken, but that was his sincere belief. but throughout the war and especially after the passing of the referendum king was extremely hesitant to deploy conscripts overseas precisely because it was evident it would deepen divisions between anglo and francophone canada. king always believed that if quebec nationalism grew too strong it would lead to a declaration of independence and intervention by the us leading annexation of canada. 

hell, he basically went to war with his martine cabinet ministers to prevent conscription going forward in 1944 by siding with his french canadian ministers. a small conscription force was only sent to europe in 1945 after it became clear that not doing so would be detriment to the war effort.

and it was actually arthur meighen who spent much of his second stint as leader of the tories pushing for conscription and damned be the objections of quebec. the conservatives and all it past and future leaders were very vocally pro conscription.",conservatives

i personally struggle to see the similarity of trudeau trying to pressure the legal system to make special laws for his donors at snc, or funnel tax money to liberal friends through charity as a \"meteor\" wiping out canada. i do get your point to a degree, that in this trudeau government it seems like we are more divided as a country than we've ever been. government spending to canadians based on race, scapegoating legal gun owners, coming up with ridiculous hotel internment policies for travellers, calling everyone a racist and prancing around in literal blackface ... yeah it's going to turn people against each-other. human nature, that would happen in any country exposed to such divisive policies and behaviour. 

the only thing i hope for, is when trudeau was telling canadians the \"budget would balance itself\" and we'd get \"electoral reform\" and there would be \"record transparency\" that people knew he was a liar, or at least do now - and they just disliked the other options. if canadians believed/believe trudeau to this day when he tells canadians he knew nothing about the sexual assault claims in the military or whatever he's on about today, we are in big trouble as being the most gullible nation out there. i hope regardless of political affiliation we give people the benefit of the doubt - and when the show repeatedly they have no problem lying to our face, the trust is gone. 

if people hypothesize that maybe a more fiscally conservative approach is worse than extra \"woke\" budgets that give hundreds of millions to china controlled banks .... sure vote liberal on policy, but i hope people don't still have some image of trudeau as an honest person - that leads to some dark shit down the road for our country, even worse than our current situation which sucks as it is for any future generations.",liberals

ford nation is a good example - rob ford was elected mayor in part by attacking downtown toronto, and promising subways to places outside the downtown core (his rants against people on bicycles are an epic example of hyper-local identity politics). 

even if the tories won just the voters that say, backed doug ford in his failed 2014 mayoral run it would be way more than they win now. let me give you an example - look at etobicoke north. it's been a liberal riding since the 80s, and the current incumbent won by nearly 40 points. but in 2014 ford won there handily even in a race he lost (and he also took it handily in the provincial election). and here we aren't even talking about the 905 which is more suburban.

and qu√©bec is plenty divisible too. there is plenty of resentment in qu√©bec against the well-heeled quarters of montr√©al (as with toronto, you probably want to include the suburbs and even the not-quite suburbs in your conception). here we can look at the places that happily vote for legault. if the tories wanted to go that route they'd slander outremont and mock (in french) the gazette. o'toole can't pull it off in french, but he can delegate to a french lieutenant.

i'm guessing that you are refering to \"les n√©gres blancs d'am√©rique\" by valli√®res?

i guess it's worth pointing out here that this book wasn't an attack on qu√©b√©cois but rather a defence.  

the author had spent some time with the black panthers a bit before the october crisis (either being sheltered by them or in prison) and wrote that book to describe the parallels he saw between french canadians and black americans in the late 60's.  

there were a surprising amount, notably the fact that french canadians were the 12th out of the 13 biggest ethnic groups in qu√©bec when it came to earnings up until the early 80s, just above indian people.

&gt; they faced themselves historically

maybe, but any attempt to highlight current discrimination is followed by outrage, denial and attempts to *deplatform from what i've seen. if i can see the use of \"cancelling\" problematic people who exhibit  bigotry or like to play with outrage, this is the kind of events does support the idea that there might be some boundaries being crossed that we should address.  

preferably, without falling in the trap of finding how a person can fall into camp x and then dismiss their opinion with prechewed rethorics against camp x like i've been seeing in some threads of this post (legault is a conservative and conservatives are x or the students are wokes and the wokes are x)",conservatives

*every* tax has some weird edge cases and exemptions, including the carbon tax, income tax or property tax. this hardly makes these taxes unworkable.

case-in-point: the carbon tax. many emissions can be straightforwardly determined by measuring the amount of fossil fuels burnt. but things like agriculture, chemical processes, land management and imports? lots of emissions remain untaxed. the idea that you must tax every single cent of the base or its a complete failure is a ridiculous standard that is exclusively invoked to oppose taxing the rich.",liberals

investors do value private companies and art when they make a raise or do a transaction, but how do you determine the value between those transactions? 

many large private companies rarely make transactions that impact business value. those that do like tech see massive changes between rounds, but also risk down rounds in between.

you suggested a ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù. how do you determine what multiple to apply? apple trades at a very different multiple of profit or revenue than microsoft or google or samsung despite all of the companies competing in similar sectors. 

what multiple do you use? you say ‚Äúprofit‚Äù but this excludes companies that make no profit but are valued highly. take a tech startup. i‚Äôve acquired several for my company for a high multiple of revenue because they were growing fast. but many were incurring negative earnings because they were investing in growth. if i valued them on profit, we would have valued them at zero. that would result in no taxes. 

plus, if we are just using a multiple of profit, then why not simply tax income more? it‚Äôs effectively a second tax on income. why not just raise income taxes on private businesses?

should we use revenue ? well that‚Äôs not really appropriate for grocery stores like loblaws that have profit margins of &lt;5%. they will need to raise prices because they are running on such thin margins. 

and finally who is to say what someone paid for something is it‚Äôs value. is there any material resale value to an nft? will the value decrease after the tax reporting period?

hdzq2ou,2021-09-23T04:05:54.000-07:00,"ndp should push liberals for public hearings on wealth tax &gt;switzerland actually excludes startups and private companies from its wealth tax for the very reason that it was too hard to measure and discouraged investment

do you have a source for this. zucman claims that switzerland does tax private businesses.

in fact, it's with reading his whole paragraph on this issue:

&gt;valuing closely held businesses as discussed above, it is likely that the share of private businesses among top 0.1 percent wealth holders is fairly large‚Äîprobably around one-third‚Äîand hence the valuation of closely held businesses is very important. it is useful to distinguish between large versus small closely held businesses.

&gt;large private businesses for large private businesses, it is possible to draw on the financial system to put market values on many of these assets. large private businesses (such as uber or lyft before their ipos) are typically valued on secondary markets, and their stock transactions are centrally registered. making such transactions reportable to the irs would allow the tax administration to value such stock systematically. 

&gt;more broadly, the financial industry regularly values private businesses (in the context of venture capital funding, mergers and acquisitions, or share issuance). these valuations could be made reportable to the irs for the purpose of administering a wealth tax and could be used to value assets retrospectively. more ambitiously, in case of disagreement about valuation for large private businesses between the irs and the owners, owners should pay in stock, and the government can then create the missing valuation market when selling back the stock. a defining feature of modern capitalism is precisely the ability to divide business ownership with dispersed shareholding. creating a valuation market is the best solution, since any asymmetry in treatment between comparable publicly traded corporations versus private corporations would create incentives to

&gt;for smaller businesses for which no information exists within the financial industry, there already exists a section 
of the internal revenue code (409a) that values private businesses for the purpose of taxing stock options or valuing iras.68 these valuations can be perfected based on best international practices. switzerland is the best example of a country that has successfully taxed equity in private businesses by using simple formulas based on the book value of business assets and multiples of average profits in recent years. the irs already collects data about the assets and profits of private businesses for business and corporate income tax purposes, so it would be straightforward to apply  similar formulas in the united states. smith and others (2019) give a recent example of how to use administrative data to systematically create valuations for s corporations using formulas based on profits, book value, and sales.this means that when the business is owned by a very wealthy individual above the exemption threshold, the business faces a higher tax through the wealth tax that takes the form of a profits surtax, a property surtax, and a sales surtax. the important point is that no costly valuation would be required each year, as the calculation would be entirely formula based. also note that few small businesses are owned by the 75,000 families with net worth above $50 million, meaning that such surtaxes would apply only to a small fraction of small businesses.

this is us-centric, but the same basic ideas apply in canada. moreover, i'd just like to emphasize the difference in tone here. this is what is sounds like when someone is interested in actually addressing challenges of a tax. this is how most economists sound when discussing carbon taxes - they acknowledge the challenges but quickly point out tractable solutions. when discussing wealth taxes, however, the stance is plainly argumentative.",liberals

i was polled by environics a few months back and the question of \"assault rifle ban\" came up. the pollster began by defining assault rifles as those that are capable of \"rapid fire' and have \"large capacity magazines\". now, ,magazines are limited to 5 rounds in canada, and select fire firearms (rapid fire) have be banned (outside the military and the police) since the 70s. so when i was asked if i support the ban, i responded that these firearms are already banned in canada. undaunted, the pollster asked again if i support he ban or not. so i was left either supporting  a nonsense (banning firearms that have been banned for over 40 years), or answer in the negative, that i don't think these banned firearms should still be banned....it was nonsense, and it made clear to me how pollsters are getting the answers the government wants; keep the plebs confused.",liberals

&gt; ... the cra would be left with 5,500 employees in quebec with absolutely nothing to do, since the feds, in an earlier questionable move, handed over collection of gst to quebec in 1991, for which it still pays quebec $141 million a year.
&gt;
&gt; the union representing cra workers in quebec is understandably worried to death about the prospect, particularly since half its members are in tax centres in shawinigan and jonquiere, where working for the feds is about as good a job as you can get. legault hasn‚Äôt promised them jobs in this combination and even if he did, the province pays its employees significantly less than ottawa does.
&gt;
&gt; scheer says that‚Äôs no problem. he would simply assign all 5,500 of the cra‚Äôs quebec employees to work on tax evasion. of course, they couldn‚Äôt be working on any quebec files, since the cra would have no jurisdiction in the province anymore. why in the world would the cra have employees in quebec to chase after would-be tax cheats in regina and halifax while having no jurisdiction in montreal and quebec city?
&gt;
&gt; and the skills of cra employees in shawinigan and jonquiere, most of whom have spent their career as collection agents, are nowhere near the sophistication needed by highly trained auditors tracking down tax evasion.
&gt; 
&gt; asked about scheer‚Äôs plan to redeploy the workers, marc briere, who heads the union representing the tax workers, is apoplectic. ‚Äúit‚Äôs absolutely insane to say something that stupid,‚Äù he says.
&gt;
&gt; the loss of 20 to 25 per cent of its business would also make all of the cra much less efficient, forcing the federal government to pay more for collecting each dollar of tax in the rest of the country or requiring it to scale back operations, including its headquarters in ottawa.
&gt;
&gt; and there are other problems as well. revenu quebec has no jurisdiction outside the province. so if a quebec business person were to move all their assets out of quebec and place them in alberta to escape the taxman, revenu quebec has no legal jurisdiction to go after them. and that would presumably be the case even when revenu quebec would be collecting federal taxes.",conservatives

this is about tyranny of the majority not specifics around certain things. courts and charter documents are to protect against the tyranny of the majority.

back to the point.

you cannot support tyranny of the majority in one case and not the other. either you support it or you don't.

if you think tyranny of the majority is valid to ban guns then when it bans abortion you must agree then too regardless of your individual view.

once you accept tyranny of the majority as a valid premise you no longer get a say when it doesnt go your way.
