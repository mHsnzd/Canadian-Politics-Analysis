most people who go to prison are not murderers, or sociopaths, or people who are fundamentally \"too dangerous to let out.\" we don't need that level of retribution (the kind that prevents you from getting many jobs ever) for someone who stole a car, or someone who was growing marijuana. it's stupid. it's cutting off our nose to spite our face. it's also draining money away from resources that could prevent many of the crimes from occurring in the first place - guaranteed livable income, social welfare programs, after-school programs, addiction and substance use help, housing for homeless, etc etc etc.

to go further, the people who deserve jail the most are the ones least likely to see it. the people who made the decisions about care quality in ontario for-profit long-term care facilities, that cut hours and wages, that cut back on supplies, that lead to their complete unpreparedness in the face of covid-19 all in an effort to make more money for the stockholders? they're never going to see the inside of a jail cell despite their actions leading to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of people. they made those choices knowing that if even just a bad flu year hit - let alone a pandemic - people would die. they did that math and said \"yeah i'm cool with those odds.\" but that's never going to put them in a jail cell despite having a higher body count than any canadian serial killer, because we have societally decided that it's not illegal.

theft is not a victimless crime, and therapy cannot undo the harm caused by theft because no amount of therapy can return to us lost opportunities and wasted time.

h9a5ft9,2021-08-16T22:25:56.000-07:00,"green leader annamie paul will skip the campaign trail to focus on winning her own seat in toronto centre i've been following the story of paul's leadership with some interest - i have to admit that this came in the summer of canadian politics which is generally when the press latches onto anything that even vaguely resembles a story.

that said, the situation has been fishy from the jump - paul has remained available to do any interviews, anytime, anywhere, where the green leadership hasn't said word one save for leaked documents with vague details. in a democracy it seems odd that the party leader is subject to such vague and shadowy machinations. in old guard politics, party members would make their concerns known publicly, stand behind them, and step down if their concerns were not met.

that said, as time goes by paul bears more and more responsibility as her wounds become increasingly deeper and more clearly self-inflicted. running in toronto centre is a dumb idea. standing behind zatzman was a dumb idea. calling trudeau sexist and racist was a dumb idea. driving away atwin (allegedly) through autocratic rule and personality clashes was dumb. 

that said, it has laid bare some serious strategic issues within the greens - they're a white party, even whiter than bernier's cpp - they don't have diversity in any measurable sense of the word in the party, and their fundraising and election machine, not to mention their war room, is sadly underequipped and inexperienced. 

paul and her advisors are making the best of what is a transitory period for the greens. without may as the figurehead and matriarch of the party it's becoming difficult for them to find and define an identity, which has understandably led them to identity politics themselves. 

i don't think it's a stretch to say that there's a lot of hidden factors involved. while i think race and identity have both played a significant role i don't think that they alone are why paul's leadership is where it is - after her series of relatively fiery press conferences she stopped bringing it up but one senses that there is a storm under the surface and i wonder how long the greens can keep steering the ship through unfamiliar waters.",liberals

well, at the time, i was much more libertarian and nationalist and i thought that scheer was trying too hard to concede to the left by not engaging in the culture war (which i was heavily embroiled in at the time). he was a socon, sure (which i'm not), but he didn't seem adamantly anti-woke. i also felt like he didn't have backbone when it came to cultural issues, as i was heavily embroiled in the culture war at the time.

in retrospect, i misjudged him, especially looking at his platform now (the cliff notes on wikipedia). i also thought bernier had a more engaging personality, more to offer, and was more innovative but if scheer ran on the exact same platform this time as his 2019 one, i probably would vote conservative. however, i also have different priorities now and bigger fish to fry.

&gt;i really thought his speech when o’toole won the leadership kinda cemented his social conservatism as well.

yeah, that's when it hit me that i had basically misjudged him. i think though that he didn't hold any restraint since he was getting the boot anyways, and the news commentators ripped him apart afterwards because he skewered him.

&gt;i would argue though that under him party discipline has loosened even further

this is a policy that i actually like from both o'toole and bernier, and is partially the reason i thought scheer was being leftwing as well (but harper apparently did the same thing so again, i was just naive 🤷‍♂️).

i will have to admit that i'm not too thrilled with o'toole's plan, and have said as much on another thread. it leaves a lot to be desired for sure, especially since it diverges from what he promised in the leadership race. but at the same time, o'toole still has an ounce of personality/charisma, the conservatives are the only ones who can win, and the ppc is going nowhere.

but yeah, i guess to sum up, i just know more now than i did then, have moderated my views, and part of it was just climate change denialism, xenophobia (i thought immigration needed to be limited and that there should be a values test) and anti-multiculturalism (which is dumb considering canadian history) which i said in my initial reply. those are big key differences between the ppc and the conservatives. i was also embroiled in the culture war at the time. and again, i'm much more pragmatic when it comes to politics now; idealism is naïveté.",conservatives

the carbon tax as done by the liberals has been hailed as the best and simplest solution by actual economists. yes not fraiser institute hacks, but by actual nkn bias economists. remember, the simple carbon tax is a conservative plan. 

additionally the bi lateral nature kf the liberal plan is again a conservative way of doing things with each province having the ability to direct the carbon tax  as it meets federal objectives.. same as the liberal child care plan, if someone has any regard for provincial autonomy what the liberals have done is by far the best way to do it. federal standards, provincial needs. 

the cpc plan is... odd, its hugely burocratic and inefficent as compared to the liberals, additionally it helps the rich far more then the poor. so when staples like groceries increase in cost due to carbon taxes, the poor suffer far more under the cpc plan, while those well off like myself get to use credits to buy green home improvments and evs.

(it's pretty similar to a supreme court justice) so there's a tradition that governors and judges are supposed to be 100% neutral, because not playing favourites with different parties is a big part of their job.

but what if a former governor decides to become active in partisan politics? could it politicize the bank of canada, because people might start saying \"oh, governor x is just biased and preparing for his future political career\"? or if carney ends up as prime minister, could he start micro-managing and trying to interfere with the bank of canada because it's his area of expertise? will future prime ministers pick governors who agree with their politics instead of the best person for the job, just in case the governor decides to run for a different party later on? so some pundits just think it's really awkward and it's best if retired governors (and former sc judges) just stay out of politics for the rest of their lives.

it's not something the average person is going to care about (although i also think carney is going to seem really out-of-touch and elitist to the average person, he isn't going to be the liberals's saviour or anything). 

in other countries, it's already common to mix politics with central banks and courts - president biden just appointed a former chair of the central bank to his cabinet (janet yellen), and the democrats are planning to run a former judge (cheri beasley) in the 2022 north carolina senate election.",liberals

[canada's corporate tax rate for instance was halved between 2001-2012](https://winteryknight.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/canadacorporatetaxrate.jpg), yet federal corporate tax revenues still made up about the same percentage of gdp despite a substantially lower rate. in practice, canadian cit revenues only made noticeable declines in the middle of an economic shock or prolonged recession (the early 80s and early 90s, global recession, the dot com bubble as well as the 2008 global recession), but the cit itself being cut did not diminish federal receipts. the same was also true in regards to corporate tax revenues [in real dollars adjusted for inflation](https://www.iedm.org/sites/default/files/web/pub_files/figure1note0418_en.jpg) where rate cuts had little to no effect on government revenues.

generally because both capital and investment are elastic and highly mobile, taxes on those assets tend to marginally depress overall revenue levels. economist stephen gordon for instance goes over this on his [blog](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/03/cit.html) when addressing the corporate tax. if the corporate tax did not exist overall federal revenues would likely be marginally higher.

in terms of corporate tax incidence/burden, between 20-70% of that is felt by labor/workers, making the tax's effects somewhat regressive. if the goal is to either increase revenue or tax rich people more, there's better taxes to achieve both priorities.",conservatives

grrlire,2021-03-21T11:45:29.000-07:00,"climate change denial proof erin o’toole’s conservatives are living in their own virtual reality its basically because most of the places that canada allows immigration from are former british colonies. ie immigrants from common wealth countries have a easier time immigrating here. historically these immigrants come to canada for the freedom it provides for their children. yet, their policy points and view are garnered from old conservative british modes of life, which are now normalized as their countries heritage. 

this view for me is based on being parents to immigrants from sri lanka. the only reason my parents could immigrate here is because my mother worked hard to get a degree (this would have been impossible if it wasn't for the free education they provide. regardless it is really competitive so i am not downplaying my moms hard work.) immigrants like my family that are from poor backgrounds are extremely rare. most of my friend in canada are from relatively wealthy families that were predominantly the supporters of old colonial rule. hence why they are more wealthy because they were able to capitalize on british colonialism. i am sure there are many reasons why this is. 

for example, sri lankas laws are made under the guidance of the british. we were only given independence after our leaders were educated in britain. this is not to downplay many progressive things that came out of independence. for instance, sri lanka had the worlds first elected female prime minister. however, there are to this day several regressive laws that are now thought to be our ancestors way. this is a lie that is basically perpetually fed to us. laws/culture that the we inherited british are now normalized and we continue to uphold them. for example, sri lanka has the strictest abortion laws in the word, even though there is no historic or religious reason for having this. it is justified now a days religiously, but its nothing but rhetoric.  

this is not a phenomena that happens in just one country. it also is happening in africa with homosexuality. if your interested in this i liked an interesting article below. 

trld: colonized countries that have western culture imposed on them are perpetuating and upholding those laws that oppressed us in the first place.(i am also not playing this victim here we need to wake the fuck up.)

rent prices have been explosive over the last five years, ditto housing prices.  most people in a 5 year fixed mortgage term haven't seen their payments go up because rates have continued to decline.

and to enter the housing market, it isn't simply the pit payments; it's also securing a down payment large enough to purchase a home, where in the gta it costs north of a million dollars.  with stagnant wages and absurd supply shortages causing upward pressure on rent, it's simply untenable.

but now it’s time to adapt and change approaches because as with any marketing campaign it won’t work 100% for everyone. so, as i see it, the two options are: 
1) mandating vaccines across the country and removing people’s individual freedom of choice, or 
2) switch to an inclusive approach that still encourages people to get the vaccine but provides them with options to not have to get it. 

now i understand providing options can sound counter-intuitive, but when you have a media machine pounding on everyone to get vaccinated, naturally the skeptical people push back. this can lead to some people becoming extremely defensive in their opinion.

so to actually encourage more people to get vaccinated the government needs to show they’re ok with the unvaccinated people not getting vaccinated. (super confusing i know)

also, i am willing to bet we would see an uptick in vaccines if our leaders put a timeline on free vaccines. if they came out and said “ok people since the majority of the population has been vaccinated, if you haven’t received your shot by canada day 2022 then it’ll cost you $25.” 

this would make some of the skeptics realize their rights aren’t being taken away, and this medicine actually costs money so they should jump in on the freebie when they can. obviously this won’t be 100%, but it would work on some. just my 2-cents :)",liberals

this is an enforcement issue, not a firearms law issue. it is already illegal to transfer a firearm to someone without a license. if the estate did this, the rcmp can charge them under the current law.  

&gt;	change how firearms are tracked? there are numerous obvious ways to prevent that lol.

ok but how? if it is so obvious why not provide specifics? tracking mechanisms like gun registries and the liberals new transfer policy would not have necessarily prevented the transfer from happening. if someone is willing to break the existing laws, new laws are unlikely to make a difference.

come on dude. if someone makes a credible complaint that a citizen is in possession of a stash of prohibited firearms, the rcmp can do their job and investigate. of course i am not saying they immediately barge into someone’s house. maybe pay them a visit and question them? maybe visit the two military veterans who made the complaint to get more information? if it seems credible, maybe go to a judge for a warrant to search the premises? none of this was done. the rcmp did not talk to wortman, did not contact the neighbours that made the compliant, and did not investigate a thing. what is the point in having firearms laws if the rcmp won’t take the most basic steps to investigate a claim of contravening those laws?",liberals

cpc started it when allowing companies (rbc) to use tfws to perform work for highly skilled canadians. lpc continued but vastly increasing the number of skilled immigrants canada takes in every year.

friends of mine who immigrated as skilled workers were shocked to learn how low wages were in canada compared to doing the same work in the united states. they are questioning if canada was the right decision considering they both would land good positions south of the border in their fields.

employers are taking advantage of it. i don't expect anything to change if we go back to a cpc government. they also know any legislative changes to increase wages they will just push onto the customer anyways.",liberals

i see the same applying here. the national flag has been lowered for months, and just seems normal now, rather than a sign of mourning. i agree that reconciliation needs to take place, and that the initial lowering of the flag was a step towards that, but now the significance of the symbol is waning. it would have been more powerful to raise the flag again, and at the same time, make some announcement that also goes towards reconciliation, in step with the afn, and the new gg. in fact, as she's indigenous, having her raise the flag the day, or the day after her appointment, would have been a powerful symbol. now that's lost, and i don't expect anything to change until the new cabinet is sworn in at the earliest.",conservatives

1. the establishment pushes it in that direction
2. the right compromises, and points out hypocrisy. instead of speaking out and pushing their ideas towards the public. things have only gotten worse for the right as they have compromised.

soc cons have woken up, they realize what is happening, that is why the cpc is now polling at an extremely low rate. we would rather vote for no one, than vote for a part that is called \"conservative\" but gives no support for conservatives that are soc cons.

the best popular vote count the ndp ever got was in 2011 when they got ~ 4 million votes (30%). that only happened because the liberals had a historic collapse the ndp had the perfect leader running a great campaign. as a result bunch of liberal voters went to the ndp. but even with everything going right the best it could do was ~100 seats.

the liberals may lose the election but they won’t collapse. but let’s assume 2011 is repeated. the ndp still need another 1.5 to 2 million votes to win enough seats to win government. where will those votes come from? 4 million votes isn’t enough. 

you can’t wave your hand and say it is possible that millions of voters who only ever voted conservative or liberal will suddenly vote ndp. even an ndp minority is almost impossible.

sorry. i'm not a phd in political science. if you want a discussion with me, you're going to have to keep the jargon out of it. it's not a convincing argument to resort to jargon.

\\&gt; they didn't \"deliberately left the liberal option of ranked voting off their report.\" out of spite, but because it is not as good of an option.

sure it is. they kept the liberal option off the recommended ballot, but kept the conservative fptp option on the ballot. so they were willing to keep what they see as an even worse conservative option on the referedum ballot. it's obvious their decision to include that wasn't based on merit.

in my opinion, the canadian people deserved to have all the options on the table. the conservative fptp, the liberal ranked ballots, the ndp proportinal representation, and whatever it is the greens and bloc would represent. the decision to have only the conservative and ndp options on the ballot was a purely partisan political decision on their part.",liberals

literally none of the federal parties have a good plan for this, because the problem is that supply is being restricted through zoning laws and that must be handled at the provincial level. you can be as mad as you want, it won't matter. provinces have complete and absolute power to modify municipal zoning laws as they see fit. they just don't want to. screaming about trudeau isn't going to change anything.",liberals

i have similar concerns about the debate but he has seemed to be polishing his speaking a fair bit. having said that, a little lack of polish might suit him well. when he relaxes a little he's a lot more 'everyman' and someone you could have a beer with, and that might be exactly what he needs to convince canadians he's trustable, in comparison to trudeau's saccharine tone.

&gt; within the current framework, diagnoses tend to very much be binary, someone either meets a particular set of dms criteria for a particular disorder (as diagnosed by a professional), or they do not.

sure, in the current framework that may be the case. on paper it's  binary, but i'm sure professionals would say some cases are better or worse than others.

&gt; i can also envision many scenarios where people may kill and not be mentally ill in any medical sense of the term. people can be pretty different

my original comment was not about people who \"kill\", it was people who \"commit murder\". i understand the difference is not obvious at first, and i could have been more clear, but i am referring to premeditated killings. people who, for example, kill in self-defense, or in a fit of justifiable rage are not the people i'm talking about.

1. it ignores tory+other vote switchers who don't vote for the other two parties for their own reasons. merging all three is bound to lose some of them.

2. the merger of the pc and alliance at the federal level actually had lower vote share in their first run as a combined party and many of their issues today can be traced back to that merger.

because to actually believe that a policy, which does not discriminate at all based on race, that requires valid id would only disadvantage black voters, but apparently not white voters, indicates you think that black people are too dumb/lazy to get id cards, and need to be coddled.

one can easily argue that the greatest present failure is that of the ones currently with the power to change it once the pattern has long been proven to exist. in practical terms the liberal government is very poor at meaningful reforms. they're very good at being nowhere near as horrific in establishing at times deliberately harmful policies that seem intent on worsening things like the cpc does, but in terms of reversing them the liberals seem even less interested than the democrats down south with the surge of \"about time\" actions by biden and company looking comparably strident.

the only thing the lpc seems adept at is the thing they've always been known for, which is managing economic policy in a way that is apparently steering the ship away from the worst icebergs and being somewhat humanistic in the cost benefit analysis of things like covid relief. when it comes to social ills they're still profoundly disappointing.",liberals

the constitution act, 1982 does apply to quebec eventhough its government didn't assent to the resolution of the chambers of the federal parliament sent to the imperial parliament. but this has nothing to do with the fact that this union is a federal one as per the constitution act, 1867 and that the said union would never have been effected had it been legislative instead of federal. a federal union implies that the federated provinces are sovereign within the bounds of their legislative powers as per the jurisprudence of the judicial committee of the privy council for the united kingdom.",liberals

hdyd5dw,2021-09-22T22:03:55.000-07:00,"election 2021: the final ridings 1) the liberals unfortunately have more legitimacy because they’ve governed and don’t have to answer this question as much but their plans are also far less bold. i’m not saying that they have to be elected twice. i’m saying they present it as “year one, we do the revenue reform and continue implementing childcare and other progressive priorities. once the revenue rolls in, we will proceed with these big ticket items (pharmacare, etc.). governments can’t do everything at once anyways, so shoring yo finances and finishing with liberal programs in year one, as well as those programs that don’t cost a lot of money, before seeing what you have won’t mean they don’t get a lot done.

it just shows a little more responsibility that might be able to draw more of the middle.

2) the grades on the ndp climate plan is the perfect example of this. he ndp, especially under singh, say they’ll do x but often just don’t provide the details. the ndp climate policy, while wanting to go lower then then the liberals, had few details about how they’d reach it while the liberal policy that was less bold was praised more because it had the details to get the job done. but this isn’t just climate policy - through most of the campaign singh struggled to describe the how.

4) you can look provincially to ontario as well to see who most unions back and unfortunately it’s not the ndp. even in 2018 they threw their weight behind wynne more then howarth. i just think that if we want to be a ruling party we need to have the majority of labour behind us.

5) the federal government has the ability to basically tax whatever it wants. the *current* ndp platform already has taxes planned for foreign ownership of homes. an additional tax on homes is well within their rights. it’s simply not just provincial jurisdiction. the only way we sort this out is if we make owning multiple properties less of a worthwhile investment - no one needs to be hoarding 10+.

hdyg8pz,2021-09-22T22:34:06.000-07:00,"opinion: if anyone should be stepping down, it’s the likeable jagmeet singh &gt; pollsters build low youth turnout into their models, 

they&amp;hellip; don't?

unlike those of the united states, canadian polling firms generally do not apply sophisticated 'likely voter' models to their results.  they universally weight their data to census-derived demography for age, gender, and province, and some firms also include education.  none of this will systematically underweight youth opinion.

the handful of \"likely voter\" surveys i saw during the past election worked by asking respondents whether they were certain / likely / not going to vote and selecting responses from the 'most certain' group.  that filter doesn't have any built in demographic bias, but if youth groups are less likely to say they are certain to vote it would underweight the group in the top-line result.

(edit to add:) it's also not like the ndp vote intention shifted much among youth, either.  compare ekos's [final poll](https://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2021/09/liberals-headed-to-form-government-2/), which had ndp at 28% among 18-34, with its [august 29 poll](https://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2021/08/daily-tracking-august-30-2021/), which had the ndp at 31% in the same demographic (within moe given smaller sample sizes).  the demographic effect was consistent throughout the race.  (on the other hand, the ppc _did_ see a surge of mostly-youth support in ekos surveys, noting that ekos also wildly overestimated the final ppc vote share.  it could very well be that ekos's surveys weren't wrong, but they captured sentiment among youth who were even less likely than average to turn out.)

the ndp also has its best support among lower-income cohorts.  we don't have hard data on voter turnout by income, but it seems very likely that poor people vote less frequently than rich people, all other things being equal.  obviously \"cater to rich people\" is not exactly in the ndp's wheelhouse, but the party needs to take that structural disadvantage seriously.

&gt; politicians cater their campaigns to target the most likely voters (according, of course, to polls) and the cycle reinforces itself.

given its persistent underperformance relative to polls, the ndp could use more of this catering if it cares about winning^(&amp;dagger;).

alternatively, the ndp could give up the fantasy that a zealous argument will lead to mass enthusiasm and automatic turnout and devote real resources into 'ground games'.  it's much less sexy than a flashy leader tour (and given the general state of the ndp's finances there is a trade-off that the cpc and lpc don't really face), but identifying supporters, knowing which messages they most respond to, and *getting them to the polls* could turn around that underperformance, but it may take several election cycles to bear fruit.

^(&amp;dagger; &amp;mdash; i'm not just being glib here.  the ndp might decide for itself that it's better to win 15 seats with an uncompromising platform than to win 50 with one that's watered down to 'cater' to likely voters.)",liberals

&gt;there's a lot that's misleading, but let's go with the proper consultations part. the argument the video makes is that proper consultations are unnecessary, because it's based off the canada health act. that doesn't really make sense, because a) its not quite the same thing b) the cha was negotiated with the provinces and c) the cha streamlined the existing patchwork of legislation. its a false equivalency to just say c-213 works because the cha does.

&gt;pharmacare needs consultation with the provinces to a greater extent than the cha does because of the need to buy drugs in bulk. the more provinces that are on board, the cheaper it will be, so the goal is to get the approval of all provinces. quebec for example has its own pharmacare that needs to be integrated into the universal system, which will require extensive consultations, especially as the bloc will flip their shit if its seen as infringing upon their system, as they did with c-213.

&gt;there's also the question of which drugs will be included, which also needs the provinces input and collective agreement.

&gt;so you might say, c-213 accept this, and recognizes that these are all things that must be done, but that the bill is just a \"framework\". to which i must ask, what's the point of the framework, then? if it doesn't accomplish funding, bulk purchasing, and a decision on what is covered, then its not a framework, it's just a piece of paper that doesn't accomplish anything. there's also no incentive in the bill for a provinces to enact pharmacare, anyway. it doesn't tie overall healthcare funding to pharmacare, which is basically the only stick the federal government has in this situation.

as a general proposition that is true, but what happened in lytton is not an example of that (and so pointing to it as an example is incorrect).

lytton/lillooet has long been one of the most arid places in the lower half of canada (north of the arctic circle is actually drier). my point being that the prime conditions for a wildfire/brushfire (hot+dry+windy) have already existed in that region for a very long time (long pre-dating the arrival of europeans). fires (mainly from lightning) are quite common in that region, however a fire is only made \"worse\" when it has fuel to feed it. if you look at photos of the region, you will readily see that the terrain is far more sagebrush/scrub than trees, and the opportunities for a fire to spread are generally quite limited. unfortunately, this time the fire had an entire small town to feed it, and so that is why the fire was made \"worse\".

look, \"climate change\" is a serious issue, and nobody should be arguing otherwise. however, what happened to lytton had absolutely nothing to do with \"climate change\", and using it as an example of \"climate change\" is both alarmist and incorrect. there are lots of good, existing examples of the effects of \"climate change\", so there is no need for us to be making some up.",liberals

progressive conservatives can be very progressive, but they are still philosophically conservative. they believe that a hierarchical society is both natural and good. a leftist thinks that society should be equal.

in other words, a progressive conservative might very well advocate for taxing the rich, for example, on the grounds that they should pay their fair share and that they have an obligation to society and that the funds should be used for a social safety net, etc... very progressive. but a leftist advocates that we shouldn't have \"the rich\" at all.

now, the ndp isn't purely leftist, there are many centrist members, and so their policy is also a mixed bag in that regard. additionally, for pragmatic reasons, of course the social hierarchy couldn't be eliminated over night even if the ndp was still the ccf and had a majority. it would take decades, and it maybe wouldn't even be possible given our southern neighbor. so when it comes to policy, ndp and pc have a lot in common. but the underlying philosophy is different, and the ndp does officially acknowledge its socialist members and ideals.",conservatives

maybe it's just me, but there have certainly been times where i haven't realized my wife was asleep when kissing her neck. and then she wakes up and tells me to stop 🤷‍♂️

if she was silent and he didn't realize she was asleep i can see how he misunderstood her liking it? 

and the consensual cues could have been the context being in a relationship, having a nice date night, cuddling/spooning, and then initiating some foreplay without realizing she had fallen asleep. 

idk, i think most people who've been in long term relationships can relate to the \"oh sorry didn't realize you fell asleep so quick\" situation. and i think the fact he apparently listened and stopped and left when asked to, that's... reasonable?  

most of us don't get charged with sexual assault and don't get it dug up during an election campaign though.

parliament's argument is that its historic and inherent privileges allow it to demand whatever information it wants, for whatever reason it wants.  saying that it's okay to demand _this_ information because the law clerk would redact it is incompatible with this unlimited privilege, since that's attaching a restriction to parliament's demand.",liberals

sadly, i don't think this would have helped much.

in my view, the critical and overriding policy failures were the delays in recognizing that covid could spread a/presymptomatically and that covid was truly airborne.

the first erroneous assumption led to policy failures across the board, including useless fever checks and more critically restrictive test policies that outright blocked data-gathering necessary to conclude that community spread existed.  remember, early testing *required* documented travel / contact with a traveler, so we simply could not prove community transmission.

the second assumption led to two big failures, in my opinion.  the first was the horrible decision to return covid patients to long-term care homes, under the theory that moderate distance was enough to prevent transmission.  the second failure was the late adoption of mask mandates, and in my opinion that error continued further with weak guidance over time to adopt better masks.  by late fall or early winter, there's no reason that vulnerable people could not have been advised to wear n95-grade masks, but we never got there.

at best, border closures would have delayed the introduction of covid variants by a few weeks, but ultimately we're at the mercy of essential travel to/from the us.",liberals

yes, that's part of cost of living that i mentioned to you. accessible infrastructure is part of any housing policy. aren't we just agreeing again? if i can't get to work in a reasonable time i'm forced to bid up real estate closer to where i work.

&amp;#x200b;

&gt;the survey found 47 per cent of respondents believed “a carbon tax is necessary to fight climate change” while 40 per cent felt it wasn’t and 13 per cent weren’t sure.  
&gt;  
&gt;the firm found 18 per cent strongly support a “carbon tax paid by everyone,” with 26 per cent somewhat supporting one for 44 per cent cent support in total. but 26 per cent strongly oppose the levy while 16 per cent somewhat oppose it, for 42 per cent opposed in total, with 13 per cent unsure.

these are pretty good polls given the pro-carbon tax vote is split by green-ndp-liberals. especially as the pro-tax vote is concentrated in city of toronto which is not electorally necessary anyway.

&gt;that was most pronounced in the city of toronto, where 56 per cent felt it was necessary while 29 per cent believed it wasn’t with 14 per cent unsure.

i'd suggest that you're overestimating the effect of blocking pipelines. [andrew leach](https://web.archive.org/web/20180920190012/https://inroadsjournal.ca/bc-alberta-pipeline-fight-undo-national-climate-plan/), writing in 2018:

&gt; without incremental pipeline capacity, there would be significant reductions in the value received for oil sands production and this would likely further limit the amount of growth and production-sustaining capital investment we would see. in 2016, the national energy board estimated what a no-pipelines scenario with these types of price impacts would mean for oil sands production. after modifying those projections to reflect reduced overall production numbers and converting them to a ghg emissions forecast, we’d expect blocking not just the trans mountain expansion but all new pipelines to result in approximately 8 mt fewer emissions per year by 2030.
&gt;
&gt; ... by contrast the pan-canadian framework, announced in december 2016, is expected to yield significantly more emissions reductions. the most recent national reporting to the united nations framework convention on climate change projected that measures implemented and under development would lead to a 232-mt decline from what was projected in early 2016 (figure 2). yes, economic conditions have also impacted these projections, but policies including the coal phaseout, the national carbon price and methane regulations play a major role.

232 mt/year is a lot more than 8 mt/year. the [2020 update](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/documents/pdf/climate-change/climate-plan/healthy_environment_healthy_economy_plan.pdf) (the \"strengthened climate plan\") reduces canada's emissions by another 85 mt/year by 2030 - see page 62.

[william nordhaus](https://fpif.org/after_kyoto_alternative_mechanisms_to_control_global_warming/) suggests that a global carbon price floor (backed up with [carbon tariffs](https://environment-review.yale.edu/can-climate-club-help-solve-global-warming-crisis-0)) is the right way to coordinate international action. here's [the price path required to stabilize co2 at 450 ppm](https://twitter.com/russilwvong/status/1066759924384915456?s=20) (in us dollars), which canada is exceeding.",liberals
