&gt; why...

because my take is an accurate and honest one.

honestly if this was 2009, we wouldn't even be having this discussion.

but i won't stand in the way of whatever dead horse needs to be beaten.

the new pope could very well apologize again and this would be a good thing.  i guess.  but the reality is if the new pope apologizes, in canada, in kamloops, wherever, the outcome is the same as it was in 2009.  we have to move on.

&gt; as a gesture of reconciliation... it was important to hear from the one person who does speak for the catholic church around the world, to hear him say 'i am sorry. i feel for what you people have suffered. we hope that we can turn the page and move toward a better future together.'\"

chances are a war torn country is probably not the best place to get a proper education that can land you a career or decent work in canada.

on the flip side it costs current tax payers a lot of money.

we can't give them money forever nor afford to give more we cant afford especially in a pandemic society when millions of canadians are on some kind of financial support.

in a perfect world we can support both, do we provide options for education? imo if they come here it makes sense to flip the bill on schooling especially when we have a massive skilled labour shortage in the country. but again canadians pay... not just me. i used social assistance for 8 months of the pandemic and now just recently finding meaningful work again.

so if so many are on the streets it might be better for a temporary hiatus on accepting refugees until we can sort out our current homeless refugee issue. 

but is it worth the lives lost if they dont come here actually worth it as we are a small country and can't help everybody?

the energy conversation is a very difficult one to nail down just right, because there are soooo many factors at play that need to be considered. sometimes things just outright aren't considered at all. such as solar's ability to increase the heat island/dome effect of areas you use them in. it depends on the layout, the type, the size, and many other things; but the end result is they all produce heat.   


and that heat has to go somewhere. so even if you ignore all the other pollution that results from making said solar panels, there is still the heat pollution that comes from both the inefficiency of solar panels, and the fact that sun + black surface = hot. that heat is going to go somewhere, and that somewhere is probably right back into the local environment.   


see. far more complicated than people take for granted. meanwhile things like hydro dams are protested, despite being possibly the better electrical generator with all things considered. we just need to replace some materials where possible with better ones, and get better about capturing the methane released. the rest is stuff to be worked on over time.

\"in 1907, bryce submitted a report critical of the health conditions in residential schools. he blamed the federal government for negligence that led to the high death rates.

\"he really believed that once he proved the problem, and gave them a solution, the government of canada would do the right thing. how could anyone allow these kids to die?\" blackstock said.

\"but canada refused.\"

bryce's recommendations were dismissed by duncan campbell scott, then head of indian affairs. scott was the man who oversaw the indian residential school system, the man who stated that his goal was to **\"get rid of the indian problem.**\" scott eventually terminated bryce's funding for research.

the canadian government, explained blackstock, \"tried to disparage\" bryce.

\"they stopped him from presenting at academic conferences because they didn't want this news to get out, and eventually they pushed him out of the public service. but even then, he wasn't silent,\" said blackstock.

in 1922, bryce wrote a book, the story of a national crime: an appeal for justice to the indians of canada. in his book, bryce outlined the government's role in establishing and maintaining conditions that led to the high number of student deaths in residential schools, and the government's deliberate decision to not take action. **the number of residential schools continued to increase in the following years. \"**

there are also different views about religion, whether it's someone's *choice* or part of someone's *core identity*. an analogy could be food restrictions. if you are allergic to something and go to a restaurant, it should accommodate you as best it can without discrimination (*core identity*). however, if you don't like some food at the restaurant (your *choice*), you shouldn't force the chef to change its menu to suit your preferences : he could choose to do it, but he could also politely ask you to eat somewhere else.

i think most québécois will say that they consider religion a *choice*. if you are not willing to let part of your religion at home to work for the state, then choose to work somewhere else... pretty much the same way you are asked to leave your political beliefs at home for the same exact reason. you can believe what you want, you are simply not allowed to display it at some specific occurrences. i found a very interesting article that discussed that at depth but i can't seem to find it, so i'm afraid you will have to do with my very unsatisfying explanation.",conservatives

here's the thing: you can absolutely be pro-life. and hold events to speak to it. and not change the law around it. many liberal, conservative, and yes, ndp are pro-life. they just agree the legislation can't be changed. prior to be elected pm, trudeau said he was an observing catholic. having views, or letting people speak is not.offensive or immoral in and of itself. there are many nuns involves in ndp causes for social justice issues too.

going out of your way to violate someone's human rights, by selling weapons to kill homosexuals, or dress up as a racial stereotype for your own amusement, and introducing motions to remove legislative oversight in a democracy is certainly more of a concern.

gu54ke1,2021-04-10T22:23:13.000-07:00,"canada’s ndp needs to go big or go home actually that's not really all that true.  for the last couple weeks of the campaign, it was pretty obvious that the ndp was going to do very well in quebec.  why, because of the utter collapse of support for the bloc and the complete disarray of the liberal party.  the quebec momentary affinity for the ndp pretty much died with layton, and i wouldn't exactly call the liberals in disarray at this point in time.  even with the cpc in shambles, i can't see them losing too many votes to anyone next election.  so where do you think this massive wellspring of support is going to come from for the ndp?    

what you would have to see is somewhat of a combined miracle for this to happen.  first quebec would have to completely reject the liberals and the bloc in favour of the ndp, like they did in 2011.  then you would need to see the liberals and the cpc completely collapse in ontario, in the manner that the conservative vote collapsed (because of the reform/pc/bloc split) during chretien's complete domination of ontario/atlantic/manitoba in the 1993 election, which btw required the ndp to also completely collapse.  oh, and chretien and the liberals ran a massive and hugely successful campaign that year.  

the larger problem that the ndp has is that they don't have the infrastructure to win in most of canada.  in the last election at the beginning of the campaign, they still didn't have candidates chosen for over half of the ridings.  when you can't even convince your local members to run, because they know they are going to lose, how exactly do you convince their constituents to vote for them?  if the ndp was to really be a national party, they would always have a candidate ready to run, someone who's public and out effectively becoming known in the riding, before the election has even been called.   otherwise, all you are hoping for is a miracle like bon jack.",liberals

suicide fatality [rates](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/) with guns is about 80%, while hanging is about 60%. i skipped \"drowning\" (65%) because the data show that real life substitution tends to flow from guns to hangings. now you're looking at 175.

for homicides, about four fifths are committed with guns that are smuggled across the border and wouldn't be impacted by any ban. that adds 40, bringing us to 215. let's assume that compliance rates would be 100% and that gun accidents would disappear. **the best figure you'd be working with is about 265.**

so we're looking at 30 deaths you'd save by banning something that's purely for fun, compared to 265 lives you might save by banning something that hundreds of thousands of canadians like me use to fill our freezers every year. the difference in usefulness is more than in line with the difference on the numbers, though i'll absolutely cede that the numbers aren't the same.

but that's at its *most* charitable to your position, because we can skip armchair hypothesizing and look at actual data from heavy-handed gun bans in countries which saw no measurable impact.

[nih study on australian gun ban](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6187796/)

&gt; *the nfa had no statistically observable additional impact on suicide or assault mortality attributable to firearms in australia.*

[here's one from canada.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234457)

&gt; *in conclusion, firearms legislation had no associated beneficial effect on overall suicide and homicide rates. prevalence of firearms ownership was not associated with suicide rates. multifaceted strategies to reduce mortality associated with firearms may be required such as steps to reduce youth gang membership and violence, community-based suicide prevention programs, and outreach to groups for which access to care may be a particular issue, such as aboriginals.*

what the second excerpt spells out pretty well is that every penny spent on bans and buybacks is a penny that could've been spent on social, economic, and infrastructural programs that would have a *measurable* impact on saving canadians' lives.",conservatives

 as for the buying power argument the rebate more than covers most individuals and families so they shouldn't be hit too hard by it. it's really just a redistribution rather than a tax so the price pressures are potentially different than you would think. there might be an argument prices would rise because of increased costs on businesses but i'd wait for a study rather than take it as fact since inflation didn't spike in alberta during their carbon price regime in 2017, it did rise in 2018 but that coincided with an overall rise in inflation across canada that year, so its unlikely that it was due or at least exclusively due to the carbon tax. considering the overall inflation rate went down year over year in 2019 despite the implementation of the federal tax, that's another argument against the idea of the carbon price radically contributing to inflation/price increases. there was a bit of a surplus of natural gas those years though so that may have offset the impact somewhat. i'm no expert though so don't take me as gospel.

from the imf analysis:

\"a drawback of carbon pricing can be the burden of higher energy prices on households—particularly for lower-income families who spend a greater proportion of their income on energy. under the current plan, the burden for the average canadian household in 2030 will be about 2 percent of consumption. canada addresses this issue by returning carbon pricing revenues to households in the form of a tax rebate or through investments, offsetting about 80 percent of the burden. this is especially important as canada recovers from the covid-19 pandemic\"

edit: \"as one starting point for considering how to effectively and equitably align their domestic production with the paris agreement’s goals, countries could look to global decline rates that would be consistent with these goals. as shown in chapter 2, annual average decline rates of around 11% for coal, 4% for oil, and 3% for gas between 2020 and 2030 would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°c, based on the mitigation scenarios compiled by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc). in order to ensure a just and equitable wind-down, countries with greater capacity and lower dependency on fossil fuels will likely need to wind down their production faster than the global average\" (page 35).

and then the table on page 37 says that canada has a high \"economic capacity for transition\" away from fossil fuel production. the table also notes that only 1% of our government revenue comes from oil and gas production (vs, say, saudi arabia where it makes up for a whopping 64% of government revenue).

additionally, page 45 provides a great summary of the state of fossil fuel production in canada.

lol, that's one way to frame it. when trudeau called the election though, the liberals were favoured to win a majority, or were at least 50/50. then the campaign went downhill overnight and the liberals were projected to lose - trudeau staged a comeback and won 160 seats, but 160 is still less than what the liberals were expecting when they called the election. trudeau sure as hell didn't call the election to win a near-identical minority - so he didn't really even meet expectations he set himself.

maybe he's still the best choice for the liberals, certainly he seems to have a solid enough base to stay on and maybe even win a fourth term. but if he's constantly put in a situation where he has to pull last-minute comebacks, he's not exactly political dynamite, is he? it's like a student who finishes a paper overnight and gets a b. sure, it looks good considering he hadn't even started the paper until the night before, but had he started the paper earlier, it could have been an a.",liberals

...

&gt; article is mostly talking about the wealthiest families and people

i think we need to recognize that there are two different types of inequality, which have different causes.

a) first, we have the widening wealth gap between the top half and bottom half of the population, which causes lots of people to feel like they're falling behind and can't afford the lifestyle they want. this is largely caused by the high price of housing, so people who own property grows their wealth much more easily than people without property. 

b) then, we have the widening gap between the top 0.1% of people and everyone else. this is largely caused by the internet/computer revolution, which lets certain kinds of businesses scale up globally a lot quicker than was ever possible before. this makes it possible for founders of these businesses to grow their wealth at astronomical rates (e.g. jeff bezos or mark zuckerberg; or garrett camp or tobias lütke for some canadian examples). but not only that, it also allowed anyone that was already wealthy at the start of the tech boom to buy stocks in these companies, and grow their wealth vicariously.

----

for a) general inequality, ways to resolve this include taxing property owners more (land taxes, property taxes, or removing some of the ways the government subsidies homeowners) or else making it easier to build homes so homes aren't as scarce a commodity. fixing the top-half/bottom-half wealth gap are politically difficult because they would hurt the finances of half the country (and no doubt homeowners are the more politically organized of the two halves).

for b) high-end inequality, ways to resolve this could include raising capital gains taxes, wealth taxes, or inheritance taxes. but we could also strengthen unions, or strengthen antitrust laws to fight against the consolidation of giant tech companies, or tighten regulations to make online business models less of an unequal pyramid. these are probably more likely to be popular, but the people being targetted have such deep pockets that it won't be painless for a politician to take them on.

these are both issues of inequality but it's important not to conflate the two. you can make a strong case that justice demands reining in billionaires. and i'd agree that we should be doing things like reining in the googles of the world and raising capital gains taxes. but i suspect the average person who's mad about affordability is mostly hoping we close gap a (the top 50%/bottom 50% gap), not gap b (the top 0.1%/bottom 99.9% gap). they want to be able to join the so-called \"middle class\", more than stick it to the ultra rich.",liberals

really. are you claiming that he did? because like it or not that is evidence he didn't, so unless you've got evidence to counter that which shows he did then you're kinda out of luck there. 

&gt;if only it were that easy! rolls eyes

well someone who actually did it says it is.  but - it's even easier to roll your eyes and pretend it isn't so i guess you and trudeau are on the same page there. 

&gt;no, it's actually not that easy

sure it is. it's not that hard at all. it's costly and time consuming but really water processing is pretty easy. hell the military has portable ones they can take to earthquake zones where the water is brutally contaminated and still produce thousands of liters of clean water. 

&gt;i mean, they lifted 38 of them in 2018 alone.

i don't think turdeau did - list them and we'll look at them and see if it was him, or if other agencies did the heavy lifting there. 

and that's still 3 years after they were all supposed to be done, and it still leaves hundreds. 

&gt;his government has lifted 117 long term drinking water advisories.

lifting an advisory just means the problem got solved - but most of those problems weren't solved by him. go ahead and list the ones where the feds were the primary driving force. lets see them. you seem to know them and the circumstances well so lets see these examples you mention and if trudeau even had any input in them. or if someone else did the heavy lifting.",liberals

hk60sua,2021-11-10T12:58:29.000-08:00,"annamie paul officially quits as green leader, will end membership in party | cbc news i'll always vote green because they are the only party to offer everything canada actually needs right now. also, the greens are the only party to not care if their policies get pushed through under other parties and they don't care who gets the credit- as long as those policies go through.

now that we notice the green party's usual platform having parts of it pushed by other parties- for example, the ndp and the dental care, liberals and child care- we can hopefully see what the greens stand for being actually implemented in canada.

the green platform in a nutshell- to raise corporate tax and use that money for dental, medication, cheaper child care, cheaper elderly care and tuition, forgiveness of student debt over $10,000, as well as ubi. by lifting the corporate tax, we may lose some corporations that operate in canada- but instead of leaving i believe most corporations will vie for our markets and try to become the top brand in canada, in order to keep that steady flow of revenue from our citizens. this will make brands compete, present better products, and reverse the bs that buying from cheap, plastic, made-in-china markets has done to our economy and the quality of goods we receive here in canada.

i do like that canada's younger generation actually takes the time to read each party platform before voting (or commenting on reddit about the lack of need for a fiscally conservative, socially responsible party in canada). considering none of the other parties have actually committed to solving canadian issues as much as the green party has- aside from environmental issues and all the issues affecting canadians that i mentioned above, there are missing and murdered kids and women, we need to start transitioning pipeline workers into new green energy jobs with training and proper compensation from the oil/gas companies (you think the liberals or even the ndp would stand up to big oil and demand they pay the pensions of those oil and gas workers who will lose their jobs in the next 20 years or so?), there are food prices being fixed and right now, a house i paid under half a million for six years ago is worth over 1.4 million. 

anyone saying the greens aren't needed or are obsolete are obviously not reading party platforms each election and making informed decisions. thank god for the younger generation, may they vote for their futures.",liberals

our population growth rate is like 1.1 or 1.2 or something? seriously - any country that can't sustain that low a growth has much bigger problems.
