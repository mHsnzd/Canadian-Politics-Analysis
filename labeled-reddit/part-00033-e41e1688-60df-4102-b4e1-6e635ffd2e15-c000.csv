this is probably one of the best ridings for them in the whole province and it's still a longshot.

in 2015, the liberals were the party of renewal and optimism, and trudeau had no negative baggage that you tend to accumulate after you know, \\*governing\\*.

results that year? lpc: 46.52%, cpc: 45.3%

the lpc \\*barely\\* won the riding in their best showing in a generation.

four years later?

cpc: 56.6%, lpc 27.0%

you'll excuse me if i don't think a red wave is coming to urban alberta.

i would also point out that even though every single riding in edmonton voted ndp provincially, every single federal riding except centre and strathcona went cpc with **over** 50% of the vote, and centre was pretty close to 50.

federally it's not as much about left versus right. it's about perceptions of pro versus anti alberta. for better or worse, the cpc is the only major party that doesn't have to prove to voters that they don't actually dislike the province.

we can debate whether or not that's fair (i would argue that the lpc has made their bed here with repeated actions that make their view of the province suspect), but it's the reality on the ground.  


this tendancy has been repeated over and over, from the united farmers, to the progressives, to reform.

to be frank, do you spend a lot of time reading what pro-life people themselves are saying or do you spend time reading others describing it?   in any case, i can assure you that for many pro-life people, (and not surprisingly pro-life women in particular because it tends to be women who first notice sexism &amp; misogyny), the misogyny of wanting to have a baby, but not a girl baby is very much an issue.   of course there remains the issue of being pro-life but this doesn't take away the concern about misogyny.  you would be very upset about the murder of teenagers, i am sure.   you would also be upset about the targeted murder of teenagers on racial grounds.  both things can be true at the same time.

&gt; putting restrictions on abortion limits a women’s right to choose. having liberal abortion laws doesn’t take away rights from anyone.

discussions are easy when you first assume your contention to be true and then notice that it is true.

you've just ignored the major issue under contention with abortion, namely, when does another person come on the scene...   saying liberal abortion laws doesn't take away rights simply assumes that an unborn person is not a person without first proving that contention.

********************
and since we're discussing the subject, i like to ask people this question of as many people as possible to get an idea of what different people think.

so when do you think that \"personhood\" begins.  at what stage of human development does a \"person\" with human rights that have to be considered appear on the scene?      and why do you choose that point in human development?",conservatives

the pandemic was certainly not forseen and kenney doesn't know how to deal with it. there are deeply entrenched problems and every single poll shows notley's ndp gaining more ground. keep in mind edmonton is under lock and key for them, and that alone is 25\\~ seats. after that, they just need to pick off a few extras in calgary, lethbridge, and maybe one swing-riding in the north. she's also the only other real contender, and even if people don't have ndp values (under 40s certainly tend to), they respect notley as an albertan and at least a decent leader.   


so where does this leave us? well, the right is just splintering, with both the ucp and the wrip (they have like 8% and that is significant) the left is consolidating under the ndp, the abp crumbled after the last election, and the liberals have been dead in the water since my memory stretches. this was not the path, and the pandemic is one thing albertan's will likely not have a short memory about.

* dealing with the disconnect between asset price growth vs. wage growth. basically, it is has become more lucrative to own things (e.g. houses, financial assets) than it is to actually work for a living. trudeau talks a lot about \"the middle class and people working hard to join it\" but his policies mostly benefit the first group at the expense of the second. potential solutions in this area include taxes on wealth, capital gains, inheritance, and large intergenerational \"gifts\"; aggressive urban re-zoning and higher taxes on empty homes, airbnb, parking lots etc.; and macroeconomic policies.  provincial governments have a big role here too, especially on housing.

* even more aggressive action on the environment and climate change.  i know that trudeau has done a lot on this issue, but we are still much slower than other rich countries (e.g. u.s., eu) in reducing emissions.we are also still building carbon-intensive infrastructure that we won't be able to use to the end of its lifetime. it doesn't help that we spent spent the last 20 years lollygagging. i would like to see a higher carbon price; fewer exceptions for large emitters; stricter project permitting; stricter building codes; and legally binding timelines for banning new fossil fuel infrastructure, production and use.


* less talk and more action on foreign policy. trudeau likes to be \"mr. canada\" and all parties treat us like we are god's gift to the world. but in reality, a lot of our foreign policy initiatives are political vanity projects or blatant pandering to diaspora communities. i don't really need a more active foreign policy, just a smarter one with with less pomp and hubris.


in a nutshell, i want the government to put style over substance; and to prioritize **the working class** and future generations over the current middle class incumbents who have shut the door behind them.  i fully recognize that these 'asks' are politically unpopular with the majority of voters, because they are middle class incumbents.  but it's my vote and you asked, so those are my priorities.

unfortunately, there's no *solution* to a the mass murder of children. the best way to move forward is to create institutions that fn people can access to create as much agency for these groups but that involves being a little bit socialist which gets lots of resistance sometimes.

that being said, if it's up to fn people to keep the flag lowered by remembrance day there will be a lot of push back against them and the federal government. we have to remember that these wars were also atrocities and many canadians had relatives who'd fought and died in them. it's in their political interests to allow the flag to be raised so it can be lowered again...

or, instead we can just lower it another half on remembrance day and have the stupid thing drag along the ground. it's just a flag after all.",liberals

no, they're not. they might be getting a small amount of vaccine at around the same time as the provinces, but since they have a completely separate medical system there's no way that the tiny amount of doses sent there would make any difference in the provincial rollout.

the delays we've seen in receiving vaccinations haven't been because of a shortage of vaccine - provinces haven't handed out even a third of what they've received to date. it's a distribution problem.

the amount that was sent to the federal correctional system was 1200 doses, a literal drop in the bucket compared the hundreds of thousands of as-yet unadministered doses the provinces have in storage.

and what's the alternative? it's not like the csc's staff would otherwise be injecting grannies in ltc homes. these people work in prisons, which are basically overcrowded petrie dishes just crawling with all sorts of disease. the medical staff who will be giving vaccines to prisoners are not people you'd really want moonlighting at your granny's nursing home.

this is a policy that literally harms no-one, and might help prevent the spread of disease among a highly vulnerable population; which helps prevent the spread from that population back to the rest of society. there is literally no downside to it. so i'm entirely unsurprised that o'toole is making it a political point. a cancelling a policy with no-downside? something that only helps people and harms no-one? that sounds very on brand for the cpc.

that's why i'm calling it bull.",conservatives

instead, placing canada under a british or french nuclear umbrella could be done cheaply, and we canadians would be desperate enough to offer a sweetheart deal. at any rate, the goal is deterrence - britain might not actually make good on their threats, but as long as there is some doubt in the united states it would make an invasion very risky. 

i'm not sure why you're knocking slbms - they mean that at the very least britain and france have some second strike capability. even five warheads hitting their targets, much less 500 could deliver catastrophic damage in a single moment (and if britain and france wanted to, they could ramp up their nuclear programs). 

in the scenario we are discussing the best strategy of the europeans would be to act as a patron to the remaining democratic world. particularly if they brought india into the fold, they could outgrow the united states in the long-run. there could even be some opportunities - global finance today is centred on nyc, but london might look like a better place if the us were run by a dictatorship.",liberals

macdonald helped get confederation to happen and dominated politics in our inception. borden led canada through ww1. diefenbaker was an ardent defender of his romantic canada who was what i would consider a proper *true blue conservative* since he was pretty. unifying; he's the proto-cpc figure. mulroney was a neocon who dreamed big and unified the various conservative elements of canada like no one had achieved since macdonald, and then proceeded to squandered it and helped usher in the destruction of that coalition. he did give canada us-canada free-trade, the gst, some strong environmental policies, etc. then you've got stephen harper, a man larger-than-life, the godfather of the cpc! he left huge shoes to fill, but he helped to create a unified cpc with a strong moralist foreign policy, unapologetic free-trade agenda, balanced budgets, and a nuanced approach to social services. his legacy will be the huge number of ftas we have now, a strong party for the right, recognizing québec as a nation, apologizing for the residential schools and starting reconciliation (regardless of what the liberals will say), helping to lead canada through the great recession, etc.

&gt;[a formula-based approach to equalization was reintroduced in 2007 when the federal government moved away from fixed-sum payments introduced in 2004. the last structural change to the formula came in 2009 when federal government changed the formula to cap the total amount of equalization payments made.](https://calgarychamber.com/equalization101)

under prime minister stephen harper and the late jim flaherty; at the same time, jason kenney was a cabinet member in harper's government. 

worth noting: 

&gt;[prior to 2007, 100 per cent of all natural resource revenues were used in the equalization calculations, with alberta and the atlantic provinces’ resources kept out of the calculations for equalization payments. since 2007, alberta’s natural resources have been included in calculating the standard, however any provinces that have eligible natural resource revenues now apply 50 per cent or zero per cent of their natural resource revenues to the formula. whichever one of the two options lead to more equalization payments for the province is used to calculate the payment.](https://calgarychamber.com/equalization101)

and:

&gt;[also added in 2007, equalization payments are now transferred to provinces based on a weighted three-year moving average, lagged by two years. this means that payments made for the 2019-20 fiscal year is the sum of 50 per cent of its payments for 2017-2018, 25 per cent of its payment for 2016-2017, and 25 per cent of its payment for 2015-2016. this method is meant to smooth out the payments received by the province in order to reduce fluctuations and ensure consistency in long term planning.](https://calgarychamber.com/equalization101)

so, the major changes that arguably has most right-of-centre politicians up in arms (resource revenue calculations and the moving-average from have to have-not), were all brought in during harper's tenure in the period from 2007 - 2009. and given that kenney was in cabinet during this time, it's quite disingenuous for him to try and pin unfairness with the program to changes that mostly happened in a government he was part of.",liberals

why is it that we are somehow married to this idea that a politician can not change his or her mind?

&gt;  
&gt;these protests have been escalating for a year. has the current government done anything so far? do they really think this carrot dangling will get them re-elected if they havent lifted a finger before this?

you seem to be blaming the federal government, but logging and forestry policy are a provincial issue (as with resource development in general).  the bc government gets to decide which forests are open for logging and which ones aren't.

the federal government can dangle some carrots to encourage provincial governments to do things a certain way, but ultimately the bc ndp gets the final say.

activist groups understand this, for example, [here](https://sierraclub.bc.ca/tell-premier-horgan-to-protect-old-growth-forests-now/) is a petition from the sierra club:

&gt;\"tell premier horgan: keep your promise—protect old-growth now!\"

in fact, the old-growth advocate in the article says the federal liberals' funding commitments are \"most welcome\" and \"what we had asked for\".

he says “the biggest glaring gap is the lack of funding commitment for old-growth from the b.c. government … this puts the spotlight on the bc ndp to move.”

funny enough, the clayquot sound protests in the 1990s and today's fairy creek protests both happened under the bc ndp.  might just be a coincidence though (i'm not sure).",liberals

they're better than nothing, but old aged security programs aren't generally the best or most efficient forms of welfare. the tend to only really benefit middle income earners while low income earners end up paying a higher share of their income for smaller payouts since they work longer and die earlier than middle and higher income earners. additionally oas programs penalize those that choose not to retire by withholding their benefits until they do. also, while it's not a problem in canada (the cpp is currently quite stable), government mismanaging the pension funds can cause net benefits to be significantly lower if the fund goes bankrupt (this is a looming issue with social security in the united states right now).

a lot of countries have actually privatized/abolished their public oas plans and instead focused on direct assistance via progressive social transfers such as sweden, denmark, japan and australia and they were able to do so in a way that made sure that the elderly/retired still received adequate social assistance. so there's probably better ways to do things than  the way we've currently been doing them in regards to the cpp.",liberals

the question is what you're cutting.  paying teachers, paying hospitals, paying for essential stuff like road upkeep doesn't just impact *today*.  it impacts what comes down the road.  education is correlated with lower crime rate and educated people that get jobs pay more in taxes in the long run.  getting good health care and having doctors today means you catch the little things for a $15 prescription instead of needing a $17k surgery further down the road.

ford cut education at a time when the expert consensus is that we were in desperate need of *more*.  he cut health care prior to the pandemic and ignored cries to give our beleaguered doctors and nurses the funding they needed to fight the pandemic.  we're hemmorhaging healthcare staff who are scared, overworked and burning out and we're swiftly approaching a point where our baby boomers are going to be hitting 70, 75, and having more health care issues.  that hurts all of us, including the conservatives as a whole, because the older age group does tend to vote more conservative.

i have family that work in/with hospitals (p.t. assessment, speech and listening therapist/r.n., &amp; a retired head of a major toronto hospital) and they've voted pretty consistently conservative for all their lives.  doug ford's handling of hospital funding had some of them spitting mad *before* covid, with the cuts agreed upon by all of them to be asinine and shortsighted, and i know at least one of them has, at 65, having voted conservative for 45 of those years, declared they'll never vote conservative again unless ford gets the boot.  purely because of the cuts.

also, she's a political neophyte (unless you count her run in scarborough in the 2015 election where she lost by 16,000 votes). but basically she's electorally unproven, making her a huge risk to run as leader in a general election. this isn't inherently disqualifying, after all, brian mulroney had no electoral experience when he became pc leader. but he was a socially moderate, fluently bilingual anglo-quebecer at a time when the liberals had been in power almost non-stop for 21 years and people were reeeeally tired of them. lewis doesn't speak french, is more socially conservative than any party leader since stockwell day, isn't a particularly energetic campaigner or skillful debater, and would be going against a liberal government that has quite a bit of support right now.",liberals

right now their is a lot of justified anxiety about the vaccine supply.  while most thoughtful people realize there is very little the liberals could have done much differently to improve the situation, most people are in a wait and see mode.   if the vaccine supply is restore and the target of, i think 6m doses by the end of march is achieved, that is still less than 10% of the population receiving 2 shots.   this will tamp down some of the anxiety, but the arrival of the far more infectious uk and sa strains is probably going to trigger a 3rd wave of infections that will lead to more closures and lockdowns before the vaccine program starts to help.

looking into my crystal ball, i think it will take roughly 3 months for the rate of vaccination and warmer temperatures to overtake the new infections. but we are probably in the worst phase of the pandemic right now.  this means more restrictions, more businesses closing, more cases and more deaths in the short term.   by may, the 60 - 70 year age group should be mostly vaccinated and they will be working on 50 - 60 age group.  if they are smart the government will spend may and june announcing stimulus, recovery, infrastructure spending and promoting the vaccine roll out.  of course this will require a new budget with the requisite poison pill for the ndp and bq.  

for the liberals, if they call an election too early it will look opportunistic and crass.  if they wait until the fall, it will allow time for the cpc possibly reform its image and the ndp to restore its finances.",liberals

this results in us doing our work after you move in.  which takes more time, at higher risk, so it costs more.  except... you guessed it, the builder doesn't want to pay more.  this often leads to an impasse.

examples include areas like markham, which has a ***very*** large asian community. there is a large proportion of the population that favors policies that encourage small  businesses, for example tax credits.  another example of a population that would be more culturally conservative would the the large proportion of filipino immigrants in areas like etobicoke who tend to be very catholic. policies which streamline immigration, while retaining its merit-based fundamentals, would  be popular, as well as ensuring remittances are easy to transfer to family back home without undue regulation.

more culturally  conservative communities in the greater gta which the liberals have a lockdown on right now include sikhs and more conservative muslim communities. the cpc needs to identify social issues which are important with these groups ***and*** align with the more traditional christian conservative base in the party. protection of religious freedom, in areas like education or expression, are an easy example.

it is sajjan's job to ensure that investigations can be conducted appropriately. it is also his job to review the performance of his top officials and to ensure they are setting the correct tone at the top. 

&gt;politicians in canada don’t have power to be the judge jury or executioner nor should they. 

they have the power to set up the system to address it, they have the power to ensure that a commander who is being investigated doesn't run the investigation. stepping in to ensure that doesn't happen is not being judge jury and executioner. failing to step in, refusing to even speak with the ombudsman, and intentionally creating a kafkaesque situation where they will not intervene because there has been no investigation and there can be no investigation because the accused is the cds is bullshit.

clearly sajjan does, if he did not, he would have acted differently.

how do you have substantial change if the minister of national defence refuses to even meet with the ombudsman or discuss the issues? the mnd set the tone from the top that he does not care, and he will not even bother to be informed let alone engage in meaningful reform. the job of the mnd is to drive institutional change. he doesn't get to actively contribute to a culture of looking the other way and protecting senior officials and then get off the hook.",liberals

&gt;in the past, immigrants who came to canada gradually integrated into our society. they did of course keep some aspects of the culture of their country of origin. they became canadian, but with a distinct flavour. this is a type of multiculturalism that enriches our society.  
&gt;  
&gt;however, over the past decades, the government of canada has pursued a policy of official multiculturalism that encourages immigrants to keep the values and culture they left behind instead of integrating into canadian society and adopting canadian values and culture.  
&gt;  
&gt;with his cult of diversity, justin trudeau has pushed this ideology even further into a form of extreme multiculturalism. he described canada as the first post-national state, with no core identity.  
&gt;  
&gt;in a free society, immigrants have the right to cherish and maintain their cultural heritage. however, that doesn’t mean we have any obligation to help them preserve it, with government programs and taxpayers’ money. the vast majority of canadians rightly expect them to learn about our history and culture, master one of our official languages, and adopt widely shared canadian values.\\[...\\]  
&gt;  
&gt;official multiculturalism is based on the idea that there is no unified canadian society and no distinct canadian identity to integrate into, and that we are just a collection of ethnic and religious tribes living side by side. but if we want to keep our country united, and ensure social cohesion, we must focus on what unites us as canadians, not what divides us.  
&gt;  
&gt;a people’s party government will:  
&gt;  
&gt;repeal the multiculturalism act and eliminate all funding to promote multiculturalism. emphasize instead the integration of immigrants into canadian society.  
&gt;

that is straight up dangerous rhetoric designed to inflame people against immigrants and blame them for all our woes. the language is *threatening* to people: \"if *we* want to keep *our* country *united*... *we* *must*...\"

who is the '*we'* in those kind of claims? well, the dog-whistling is clear: it means white canadians whose ancestors immigrated here in the past. how do i know that? read the opening sentence. it's explicit. they want a return to a non-welcoming, non-multicultural, non-ethnic, non-international canada. they want to return to our isolationist pre-1970 (i.e., pre-the elder trudeau) past. why? because anti-immigrant populist rhetoric mobilizes people against a common enemy: in their twisted view, the cause of this immigration is left-wing politicians, and trudeau in particular, and they are nothing but \"elites\" who are making life harder for \"real canadians\" (\"we\").

this is disgusting and it needs to be put in its place (the dustbin of history).",liberals

with all due respect, it's not that 'this doesn't follow', but that you don't follow.

specifically, the_mayor refers to 'enlightened centrists', a shorthand for those who dismiss or muddy the conversation by saying 'both sides do it' or 'both sides are fundamentally the same' and then doing nothing else about the actual issue.  

the 'enlightened centrist' may not actually be a centrist in terms of personal political beliefs, and it can be a rhetorical device, often used by internet trolls.  this gets tricky because actual political centrists in general are more prone to apathy; it's hard to be both enthusiastic and outspoken about politics and politically neutral.  enlightened-centrists-as-trolls, enlightened centrists who fell prey to a rhetorical antlion trap, and the bulk of apathetic true centrists can be put under the broader umbrella of enlightened centrist.  the effect is the same: political nihilism.

in general this is a bit of an issue because in general, a lot of voters are apathetic and may trend centrist.  many only get surface-level news, only really follow politics in the heated moments before an election, and are thus prey to the notion that, say, antifa or far-right violence are equivalent, or that the ndp and cpc's climate change policies are the same.

the mayor's statement follows just fine.  what you're failing to grasp is that he's frustrated at the people who are falling prey to (or, i'd add, those exploiting) the 'both sides are the same' notion.  kodos and kang.  it's something that warrants mention, especially for those who care about the issue.",liberals

&gt; unfortunately, lessons provided are not always lessons learned. crucially, the numbers show canada failed to learn from its most recent opportunity for education: the sars outbreak.

&gt;post-sars, governments in canada studied and planned for future pandemics and increased spending on public-health measures. yet successive federal governments produced conditions that left canada unprepared for covid-19, with the trudeau government seemingly quietly deactivating the country’s pandemic early warning system in 2019, failing to maintain stockpiles of personal protective equipment and moving slowly once the pandemic began. taiwan, in contrast, established a national command centre in 2004, which helped the country co-ordinate and map out its current and significantly more successful pandemic response.",liberals

thank you for informing me of your level of dismissiveness. if you *had* bothered to check, you would see that this is **not** a **\"copy paste response\"** but rather one that is original. i have re-worked a small amount from a previous comment in order to tailor it to you. so please, be respectful in that regard. 

&gt; additionally would you consider disqualifying indigenous persons from donating? as their population is also disproportionally effected by hiv. around 16x if i'm looking at the numbers correct? so where do we define a cut of of order of magnitude to be acceptable?

(1) this line of argument keeps being brought up, however it's disingenuous.

(2) you should try to do a literature review instead of getting me to do it for you. 

(3) being of indigenous background is not in and of itself a risk factor. there is no known means of communication that is solely associated with having an indigenous background. but let's say for sake of argument that there is something: smudging. so if there's a 50 in 10,000 chance of communicating a tti via smudging, then *yes*, such a person should be subject to a 3 month deferral. but that isn't the case.

(4) the primary routes of exposure with the greatest risk remain the same: pwid &amp; gbmsm. the problem is that, in canada, there is a greater *prevalence* of drug use among the population of those with an indigenous background. the *prevalence* of hiv among pwid nationally is about 6.0%; among those with an indigenous background, it is about 15.4%. (see: [survey report among indigenous participants who inject drugs in canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/reports-publications/canada-communicable-disease-report-ccdr/monthly-issue/2021-47/issue-1-january-2021/survey-report-indigenous-participants-inject-drugs-canada.html) in the canada communicable disease report, 2021). compared to those of other backgrounds, where the hiv prevalence rate among pwid is around 6.1% to 6.6% in canada. 

put another way:

&gt; the majority of cases attributed to pwid were reported as indigenous (68.1%).

source: [hiv in canada—surveillance report, 2017](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/reports-publications/canada-communicable-disease-report-ccdr/monthly-issue/2018-44/issue-12-december-6-2018/ccdrv44i12a03-eng.pdf)

hence having an indigenous background is not a useful category for deciding whether one has a sufficiently high risk of tti incidence. 

***

&gt; also as another user asked \"we haven't quantified the increased hiv risk of msm who claim to be monogamous.

in one study that i read, there was about a 10% rate of seroconversion among hiv-seroconcordant long term homosexual partners. 

but back to the main problem here: \"msm who claim to be monogamous.\" first, one partner cannot vouch for the other. so imagine that we bring in the couple. we ask each one separately, \"are you fully monogamous?\" if one confidentially tells the healthcare worker, \"no\", you *have to* deny the other from donating. in which case, you will have revealed to the other that he is being cheated on. hence one cannot get an honest answer from the partner and there are incentives against getting an honest answer. 

***

&gt; i'm guessing you would have argued the same thing when there was a 5 year ban too.

again, third time you're trying to make me out to be a straw man chock full of homophobia. no, that isn't the case.

gxvhfai,2021-05-12T03:03:19.000-07:00,"'it is extremely disturbing': nazi flag seen flying on second rural alberta property in a week &gt;in poland actually like very recently riots broke out due to the laws on abortion. the people didnt just simply go underground. no, they started becoming more violent. may i say \"demestic terrorists.\" (yes that counts as domestic terrorism, just not in any way compareble to the real terrorists that haunt the world) but that is my point, except the crazy part was, the pro-choice people did have a bigger voice than social conservatives do in canada. the real worrying part is, if that is the case. then you know how bad it could get over here right with conservatives?

what does poland have to do with what happened in canada?

&gt;the problem is the right will have no problem with calling that situation in poland domestic terrorism. but the left will. the reason is because the left sees this as an important issue for them. the right doesnt see having a pro-choice situation in their country as a good thing. rather the opposite. so they are willing to call them terrorists.

again i don’t see the relevance to what people in another country with a different history, culture, and political climate has to do with our discussion about canadian politics. 

&gt; its much harder to find \"principled\" right wing terrorism, due to the nature of social conservatism being rooted in christianity. those who are specially very principled would find it very hard to justify violence. but those in the far right dont have to  really deal with this problem. so they are willing to become very violent. so if one shifts from conservative to nazi, that is why its worrying.

even more of a reason not to give these people more of platform or cater to their demands/threats.

&gt;”these people are crazy, how are they even able to justify sych a horrible tragedy? will they not cry if millions of children are hurt around the world while they are alive? why dont they have the same view of children in the womb? why do they think this is just a joke? this is just demonic\"

&gt; the problem is you havent understood the other side. which i will not blame you for, even the right has the same problem. as a centrist, its easier for me to deal with this issue and see both sides. but when you are that principled, its harder to see the other side.

and yet when you ask these people why they don’t go after child poverty with the same fervour they go after a woman’s right to control her body there’s never a real justification. the fact of the matter is the pro lifers could do a lot to reduce abortion rates but they resist nearly all of them. stronger social supports so people can afford children? nope. better sex education? hell no. instead they opt for the most oppressive method they can. if that’s not a tell about the real motivations behind this movement, i don’t know what is. 

&gt; right wingers see you as \"baby genocide supporters\" the same way you see them as \"extremists wanting to oppress women\". this is why its soooo important to talk. you dont see them, they dont see you. you will never see each other if you refuse to give an eye and ear because you see the other side as evil.

except one of those two points are a fact and the other is up for debate, at best. the question i usually ask pro lifers who tell me life begins an conception is this: 

there is a burning building in one room is a tray of 5000 fertilized eggs and in the other is a 5 year old child. you can only save one side. who do you go for? 

&gt; the best way to find a solution is to come together and with us enlightened centrists lets really find a solution to these problems!

the main problem with centrism, and believe me there’s a lot, is it’s relative to both sides and not on what is actually right. in relation to the abortion issue is that the pro lifers entire foundation for their position is based on religion, that alone should disqualify their viewpoint from the discussion from a legislative perspective. yet a centrist would still consider this position. 

&gt; ahhhh, yes they do. that is the problem. that doesnt do anything does it? them calling blm just terrorists instead of engaging in convosation will help nobody eh? that is why you must listen to each other, and stop calling each other satans, terrorist oppressors.

okay so i listen to people tell me why abortion is wrong. cool, now what? what is the centrist solution to this? any non oppressive solution to this “problem” is heavily left wing. 

&gt; but in canada there are no major socially right wing news stations. most are either center or left.

what are you talking about? 

&gt;there are far more leftists content creators, than the opposite. yes i know there are people like joe rogan. but the left has much more power in that area due to most of the creative folk, tending to be left leaning.

this is purely based on your opinion the stats do not support or position at all. if you are just going to pull crap out of thin air i’m not going to continue this discussion. 

&gt; now in america the right does have much more of a stronghold. but this isnt the case in canada. i mean even our cpc leader isnt pushing for really any socially right wing policies. surprisingly thats even the case with the ppc.

because it’s not what the country wants. pushing socially right wing ideas is political suicide. and yet somehow in your mind that means instead of accepting that, we should give a bigger platform to oppressive fringe ideologies.

&gt; the internet is toxic, and rarely if ever helps people get into understanding each other. the algorithm is built in a way, to avoid such things.

that doesn’t matter that’s where more and more people are going to get their news, and that news is heavily right wing.

&gt; this is why we need dialog, and open convo here in canada, in the streets, in universities, and all over.

some things don’t need to be discussed. for example, just because a small group of people believe all jews should be killed or kicked out of canada, doesn’t mean we need to entertain that discussion or we must listen to it at all. they’re free to spew their shit and we are free to ignore it. if they choose to be more violent to be heard it’s not on anyone else.

centrism is probably the second biggest issue here and our discussion has really highlighted that. at its core it’s devoid any substance, it’s a lazy persons political stance. if i say the earth is round and someone else says it’s flat, there’s only one truth and yet a centrist will try to find some stupid amalgamation of both opinions and never actually pursue the truth. only one of those opinions is based on science and measurable data, but that’s irrelevant to a centrist. 

and of course there’s the obvious contradiction that undermines your whole argument. since centrists are committed to the centre, and not the truth or whats the best action, all you need to do to win them over is to be more extreme and aggressive than the other side and pull the center closer to your side.",conservatives

hc3piin,2021-09-08T06:30:24.000-07:00,"politics, polls, and punditry - wednesday, september 8, 2021 my thoughts on this:

both the lpc and cpc could probably be happy with this. the lpc are obviously up in quebec, 7% ahead of the bq. they are also doing well in atlantic canada and bc. 

the cpc are happy primarily for one thing, but it could be a huge game changer in the election. they're getting 43% (up 8% over lpc) in the 905 region as well as being tied statistical tie in ontario (lpc 36% to cpc 35%). 

this is largely where the acclaimed lpc vote efficiency comes from (along with the greater montreal area), winning a lot of seats by smaller margins in the region around toronto. 

it looks like this time the lpc vote efficiency isn't nearly as good, with the lpc actually now lagging in the 905. this could translate to *a lot* of seats flipping from lpc-&gt;cpc. this was where harper won his majority in 2011, but in the past two elections it has been very good to the lpc. 

so this really seems like a mixed poll for both parties. lpc has a nice topline number and looks to hold onto most of atlantic canada, bc seats and likely make gains in quebec, but could lose a lot of seats to the cpc in ontario. 

the cpc seemed to have significantly increased their vote efficiency with those numbers in ontario and could win a lot of seats in the 905 today (o'toole is \"only\" getting 53% of the vote in alberta compared to scheer getting nearly 70% in 2019). 

if these results were to happen today, and ignoring the changes in other regions, it would be interesting to see if the gains in quebec could outpace losses in ontario. the cpc have the chance to win a lot of seats from the lpc in the 905, with each seat won brining down the seat gap by 2.

i tend to think the lpc would still win in this scenario, but the seat lead over the cpc would be a lot smaller than the number tctc is predicting. the vote distribution is very different this time around and the cpc's vote is far more efficient.",conservatives

this is true of many of the things conservatives don't want to spend money on, from low income housing, to minimum wages, to safe injection sites, to mental health treatment. the list could go on and on. the truth is that poverty and marginalization are very, very expensive -  much more expensive than the mitigations that tie conservatives in knots. every person that goes to emergency instead of being treated at a clinic, every person that requires a police intervention instead of a medical one, etc, is costing multiples of the cost of doing the right thing in the first place.

that is just the direct costs. the indirect costs of the lost economic output of people that aren't healthy enough, aren't educated enough, aren't everything enough, are incalculable. i used to consider myself \"fiscally conservative, socially liberal\". now i know that is an impossible thing, and that the countries that invest in giving every resident an opportunity are going to be the powerhouses of the 21st century.

indigenous people are all of this in spades. miserly governments and racist ones have kept them in poverty since before canada was canada. the lost economic potential is impossible to conceive. it doesn't have to be this way and canada will be much, much better for it if we can unlock the creativity and productivity of this 5% of our people.",conservatives

gtaw7gq,2021-04-03T11:04:43.000-07:00,"biden's proposed $2-trillion stimulus will spill over into canada — but it could also hurt our competitiveness man they love patting themselves on the back for a bill they haven't even passed, nevermind implemented in the real world and is spread over 8 years.

just taking the 'miscalibrated' 70-100 billion of trudeau's stimulus and adjusting per capita and you've got parity. when you remove the 400 billion from biden's bill that goes to caregiving ( something that's likely to be found in a separate initiative given how entangled that would be with provincial matters ) the us is falling significantly behind canada's pace of spending.

of course much depends on what the nature of that 70-100 billion is, where it's going to be spent and how it impacts our emissions different answers there could radically alter the character of this comparison.

the major difference here seems to be the whole 8 year outlook of the plan which i'm dubious about at best. for it to survive biden and/or allies have to survive 3 elections, ambitious indeed. for trudeau's plan to pan out it could be 1 or 2 elections. this doesn't mean i'm against long-term planning, quite the opposite, but i've seen this rodeo before and it didn't amount to much. just see the unspent money in obama's stimulus for reference. if biden was promising specific physical results along with this i'd be singing a very different tune based off those goals but as is i'm not at all convinced that this isn't just a big number to put in news articles to assuage fears about the economy. a fair bit of this isn't directly biden's fault either as the nature of us government means they have a hard time finding capable partners at the state and local level but that's part of the context this 2 trillion figure is being pumped into.

a lot less talk about the topline figures and a lot more detail about what's actually going to be done with the money would do everyone a lot of good, especially in canada because that *is* a place where canada's clearly behind in defining where they expect that 70-100 billion to go not just in allocation but in specific projects.",liberals

the cost of housing alone forces a lot of people into poverty they should t need to be in if we managed supply more effectively. 

i think carbon taxes are a really great way to address the market failures leading to climate change. but that’s not really a tax, it’s just including an externality that costs society money in the price of a product, so really, not having carbon prices is a future tax.

a trips waiver would allow governments to order current ip holders to license their ip to and share information with generic manufacturers. this would obviously allow us to massively increase current global production by bringing more vaccine manufacturing capacity online. so anand's response that a trips waiver wouldn't help because current limitations are with production and supply chains is a complete dodge of the question, and a complete misconstrual of the reason so many organizations and countries are calling for a trips waiver.

&gt; this is just the first step into chinese levels of censorship.

is it monitoring all phone calls, messages, and content on the internet? searching for specific keywords, allowing for the targeting of people with certain viewpoints? that happens here, now. or is it just extra spooky that it is chinese instead of through the marketing lens of these tech monopolies? 

&gt; we do not need more regulation.

regulation is neither good or bad, it is specific to what is being implemented. if we added regulations saying that companies cannot put carcinogens in food, would that be a bad regulation?

&gt; enough is enough, the internet is fine the way it is.

is it, because it seems like 3-4 companies essentially own all traffic on the internet. do we want that much power in the hands of so few people?

&gt; we are one of the least competitive western nations on the planet, in every single industry, because of our ridiculous nanny state over regulation

could this be to our size relative to other countries, relationship with the us, and some indication of protecting people that live here, as weak as that is. 

&gt; we do not need shitty canadian shows shoved down our throats, disney+ for example, there is literally zero canadian shows on there, because disney is american, what would disney+ gain from this?

this is subjective, personally i dislike the overwhelming majority of disney+ content, how many superhero movies are we supposed to watch. perhaps this gives an opportunity for less connected individuals to create something from a canadian perspective, it is not good or bad, it is relative to what the product is made. people really like schitt's creek as one example. there are certainly some cringy canadian shows, but a lot of shows, regardless of where they are from or how they are funded are incredibly crginy. because it's subjective, you may not be the target audience. what is your favourite show, i guarantee there are people that think it is complete garbage that should never have been made.

just to recap, we went from chinese level censorship (which really isn't that clear what you mean and how it's different from what happens here in terms of the entire population being surveilled at all times), to disney, one of the largest and wealthiest companies in the world that control so much of the media we consume being burdened by needing to produce canadian content? 

how are you making these incredible leaps? just like i'm not going to watch the next superhero movie, you don't need to watch anything you don't want to watch. 

newsflash, disney+, facebook, google, amazon, etc are just making decisions that they find profitable, profitable for them does not mean a better service for people when they are a monopoly.",liberals

that's a big generalization. just switching to a pr system and assuming similar results means that the cpc would often be the largest party and have opportunities to make coalition governments.

it’s not unnecessary. the regulatory tools it has now are blunt instruments that would apply awkwardly online, and actually result in the over-regulation that literally nobody wants. the goal is to give them limited tools that are better suited to the objectives.

&gt;but it's pretty clear that the goal here is to get the crtc working actively into areas they haven't been. so... the mandate.

and what, exactly, is “the mandate”? be specific. the mandate is clearly not, “maximally regulate everything,” and if you think it is, then quote the bill to that effect, as i have. the specific nature of “the mandate” matters. you’ve been just making up what you think it is. that’s not how it works.

&gt;crtc won't licence online undertakings, which means they won't fall into the exception you're talking about. which means that these will just fall into the whole \"not cancon\" void.

i don’t know what that means. c-10 will create a new regime with new, almost certainly more flexible rules. it won’t applying existing rules and categories online.

&gt;i think you're missing the metaphor here.

laws don’t work in metaphors.

&gt;but if no one knows how the bill is going to work, throw it the fuck out and kill it with fire.

no one knows *exactly* how the bill will be applied. the general contours, however, can be readily determined by reading the policy objectives, regulatory policy, specific powers and limits thereon, and past precedent. just like the whole rest of the legal/regulatory system in canada works. if you want to “kill with fire” everything that involves some degree of uncertainty and interpretation, you’d might as well start with the *charter of rights and freedoms*, which includes imprecise and debateable concepts like “liberty,” “security of the person,” and “reasonable limits…as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.” you could then move on to family law, with concepts like “best interests of the child,” criminal law with, “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and contract law with, “implied covenant of good faith/fair dealing”.

conversations like these continue to enforce in me the belief that if we didn’t already have the concept in western civilization of the rule of law, we couldn’t invent it today because too many people wouldn’t accept it was possible. i say entirely without exaggeration that we would struggle to criminalize actual rape, if it wasn’t already a crime, because many—and, yes, they would be largely made up of conservatives and libertarians—would claim it “outlaws sex,” threatens the propagation of the human species thereby, nobody could possibly know what “consent” means, and anyway people (women) would abuse it all the time to throw every man they ever kissed in jail. i mean, incels and the incel-adjacent already argue those things. can you imagine if we didn’t already have however many centuries of precedent demonstrating the contrary? “if you give government/courts/tribunals power to do something, they’ll automatically abuse it and run rampant.”

we live in a world completely without nuance, where nobody wants to deal in complexity. kill it with fire indeed.",conservatives

my comment was to talk about how the federal government usually has a history of making bad decisions and provinces/states would probably be better at handling certain issues. provincial governments know more about the needs of their people when it comes to, abortion, guns, minimum wage and spending than the federal government. i support equal rights for everybody no matter their, colour, religion, gender identity or sexuality.",conservatives

this isn't an ideology thing, at least not entirely. there's just some basic competence and consistency issues that made dealing with the us under trump way way harder. this didn't just have canada caught up with a whole bunch of protectionist drive and subject to more then a few twitter comments from the twat in chief but it also meant that those that elected him didn't get anything they were voting for on a policy basis. the wars that trump bashed bush over continued on, obamacare remained and hasn't been replaced, the us continued an industrial decline.

this isn't to suggest that biden is going to turn everything around but while he's definitely coming up short of 'under promise and over deliver' he's at least getting the 'under promise' part right that leads people to being somewhat satisfied with what they're getting.

&gt;there is no need to rag on trump as it shows us to be mildly \"back stabby\". there is even no need to mention trump

it shows that we're willing to be honest, i mean hell if we're going to be that afraid of offending people then why have a vote over the genocide happening in china? certainly going to offend some people doing that.

&gt;(2) interfering in the internal politics of another nation is a no-no.

he's not, there's no election on and the midterms are a long ways off. more to the point the impact of trudeau expressing some relief that he's got a partner in dc he can work with is going to have a minimal impact at the best of times.

&gt;if i was biden i would say \"our past president was a fine president who represented our nation well, and even though we may disagree on some policy issues, i want to make it clear that he is a fine example\". this gets trump's base onto your side and stops dividing the us. i'm rambling.

this is basically bullshit, it's a nice notion but it ignores how us politics are in a number of ways. for one they're incredibly partisan to begin with, there's little biden can say to reach them, there *might* be some things he can do in terms of positively impacting their lives. this leads to the next problem, whatever the trump base might want mcconnell and the other republicans ( with a handful of exceptions ) are going to fight biden every inch of the way.

those of the trump base that are still with him after jan 6 and are concerned with what nice or mean things foreign leaders say about him aren't worth compromising with they're so caught up with the culture war wrapped around their dear leader that trying to find common ground will amount to capitulation on a wide range of important issues.",liberals

understanding that trump supporters may be a varied and complicated bunch that can be reached doesn't mean you reach them by protecting the ego of their dear leader. likely as not those supporters are going to be little more then a negative impact on us politics until they admit the flaws of trump and start to actually engage with his policies ( basically a rude republican ) instead of his rhetoric.",liberals
