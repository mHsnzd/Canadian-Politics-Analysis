false. trudeau didn't get the recommendation he wanted from the committee. are you suggesting the ndp should have twisted the committees recommendation to be what trudeau wanted them to decide on?

you are addressing a topic of my expertise, and you are right until the word but.

may i inquire as to what you were doing in 2009 if it's not too impolite to inquire?

10 years ago, what would have been your status:

* not born yet
* born but not voting
* millenial to the moon! woohoo! apes together strong
* none of the above . . .

my money is c but it doesn't matter because i can ask the same question to anyone in the d and they don't remember anything of particular interest occurring in 2009. 

a common defence of prime minister justin trudeau not declaring a national public emergency is the minority government status.  or that federalism means the provinces can better manage public health resources. frequently trudeau himself has indicated a \"one size fits all\" approach wouldn't work.

all of that flies in the face of prime minister stephen harper's minority government pandemic response in 2009 :

* *lessons learned review:* [*public health agency of canada and health canada response to the 2009 h1n1 pandemic*](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/about_apropos/evaluation/reports-rapports/2010-2011/h1n1/f-c-guidance-orientation-eng.php) (online report)
* [*canada’s response to the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic*](http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/403/soci/rep/rep15dec10-e.pdf) (senate report)

if you don't remember lockdowns, shutdowns and having politicians blaming you in 2009 for the spread of the pandemic - it's because it was a blip on the radar for canada.

the h1n1 influenza pandemic hit the rest of the planet very hard: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\\_swine\\_flu\\_pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic)

those lessons learned predict at least one problem trudeau has created.  the provinces do not have the epidemiological experts to provide proper guidance.

incidentally, prime minister harper did not declare a national emergency, only activated a national public health emergency.  when the who declared a public health emergency, that triggered  canada to use its pandemic playbook.   harper just followed the advice of those at phac and they followed the pandemic playbook.  for example, when a  community case was confirmed in canada on april 23, 2009 that triggered the activation of the department of public safety.  trudeau has often stated federal resources would be limited for a national response and its entirely because there's an entire federal department who would normally lead the response and direct phac and the caf but instead they are sitting on their hands. 

prime minister harper activated a national response where several federal departments formed the canadian pandemic influenza preparedness (cpip) task group with the cooperation of the provinces.   some of all may remember that back in 2009 most provinces were primarily liberal-led and there absolutely was push back.  this is when provinces were expressly threatened that any divergence from federal response guidelines put forth by cpip would result in a forced federal response  (use of emergencies act).

the problem with the current situation is not the failure of a declaration of a  national emergency.  the problem is trudeau isn't using canada's pandemic playbook to implement a national response (where step number one is to activate the department of  public safety) and has instead passed the buck onto the provinces.

one more thing about prime minister stephen harper's 2009 pandemic response, is it was done entirely during minority rule.  i'd like to share if i may one thing that harper did really well during the pandemic.  

nothing!  

prime minister stephen harper didn't want to be a part of cpip or talk to them.

he hated every measure that cpip recommended.  he felt the scientists were being overdramatic and everything they wanted would trigger an election.  so harper did what he was best at doing - gave the baton to the scientists to run with and drove behind them with a bus.  ready to roll over them the moment they failed.  

harper refused to attend pandemic update press conferences.  for each and every meeting with cpip he insisted there were two members of the opposition party there and he sat on the same side as them! 

when cpip would table a presentation for action, if harper felt the opposition members were just going to let him make the sole decision he would interrupt the meeting, kick out the members of cpip and then huddle with the opposition to conspire against the proposal.  

canada's pandemic response team, cpip, was led by none other than dr. theresa tam.  who incidentally, wrote canada's pandemic playbook based on the lessons learned from sars and mers. it's actually a well-balanced plan of measures addressing concerns of social and economic factors, all within the financial restraints towards health that our governments always seem to have.

the thing about being so successful at keeping a pandemic at bay is that now barely any canadian remembers the bullet we dodged.  it equates to, someone with precognitive ability tackles you to the ground to avoid a bullet.  you'd be looking up at them from the ground wondering why they are such an asshole. or if you lived in new zealand and your government shut down international travel.  you'd be pissed at prime minister jacinda ardern until you noticed the rest of the planet going up in smoke. 

if you still aren't convinced dr. theresa tam's pandemic playbook could have played out well for canada for this current pandemic, keep in mind it's the same plan new zealand implemented as well as every other covid-zero country.

the people who own gun licenses are usually the safest people with firearms. the government does a pretty good job of making sure of it. the number of shootings in canada is not even a fraction of the number of shootings in the usa. which is amazing considering we are right next door. canada doesn't have a gun problem, it has a gang problem. canadian firearm homicides in 2019 was 249 deaths, around 99% from gang shootings and in the usa 2019 had just over 15,200 deaths.",liberals

\"austerity\" in politics generally refers to a policy of public spending cuts. in that sense, this particular liberal government has never put out an austerity budget, and this particular one is the farthest thing from it.

the author's interpretation of austerity seems extremely loose. their criticism of the liberal budget seems to be that it doesn't go far enough on housing, pharmacare, and climate. fair enough, but not spending as much as you would like isn't *austerity*. if that's how it works, who even gets to define austerity? what's the numerical threshold to spend to reach the \"not austerity\" mark? words don't just mean whatever you would like them to mean, ffs jacobin.

edit: i realize they're not exactly calling this particular budget an austerity budget, rather saying that the political class hasn't abandoned the mentality of austerity for good. okay, perhaps, but this budget is not really demonstrative of that, is it? in fact they presented no real evidence to show that, which makes it a weak point. it's just a really weirdly written article",liberals

according to the 2019 budget, the first step to pharmacare was to set up a \"transition office\" within health canada. i was never sure why that was necessary (it wasn't part of the hoskins' report), but the gov't seemed to think it was in 2019. that's not something they need anyone's consent for, but they've pulled the plug on it without any explanation.

the next step (the first step based on the hoskins' report) is to form the canada drug agency. that does require provincial buy-in but, according to the pmo, they have it. there was a first ministers' meeting in december 2020, and the pmo came out of it saying \"on pharmacare and high-cost drugs, the government of canada, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, will create a new canadian drug agency\". that was only 4 months ago... but any mention of the cda is gone from this budget with no explanation. why not move ahead on that?

creating the formulary would be among the next steps, after the cda was formed. i see no sign that there's enough agreement between the provinces and federal government to move ahead on that, if agreement is necessary first. but the pmo claims that the december 2020 meeting was when the pm proposed the federal and provincial governments *begin* working together on pharmacare. has there really been so much discussion in the 4 months since, with so little progress, that trudeau's been convinced to abandon the entire project? there's been no public sign of that.

even if there has been, why not still move ahead with the pieces which the federal gov't can do unilaterally? or already has agreement on?

 article excerpts

&gt;conservative  politicians are sometimes suspicious of advice coming from experts for  good reason: the experts just want them to not be conservatives.  
&gt;  
&gt;but  sometimes, their suspicions cause them to ignore good advice. this may  have led ontario premier doug ford to take actions that could doom his  government. if so, it won’t be the first time.  
&gt;  
&gt;former  premier mike harris’s determination to keep cutting regulations,  despite the warnings of experts, contributed to the deaths of seven  people in the town of walkerton, and to the progressive conservatives’s  defeat at the next election. mr. ford may face the same fate, and for  the same reason.  
&gt;  
&gt;in may, 2000,  walkerton’s municipal water supply was contaminated by e. coli bacteria.  along with the deaths, more than 2,300 fell ill, some severely.

....

&gt;the  inquiry also concluded that the harris government had contributed to  the disaster. the ministry of the environment was no longer able to  properly monitor municipal water supplies because of cuts to its budget  and changes in regulations.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;but people expect  government to protect public health. experts warned that spending cuts,  deregulation and privatization had gone too far, endangering public  safety, and walkerton proved the experts right. in 2002, mr. harris  stepped down as leader; his successor, ernie eves, led the pcs to  defeat. the tories remained in the wilderness for 15 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;since  the pandemic began more than a year ago, mr. ford has sought to balance  the needs of workers and businesses alongside the recommendations of  public health and medical officials, an approach that until recently  earned strong public approval.        
&gt;  
&gt;but  in the winter, the government appeared to lose that balance. a number  of public-health officials and medical specialists warned that a third  wave of covid-19 infections, fuelled by more infectious variants of the  virus, could slam into the province unless the government kept tight  restrictions in place. seeking to preserve jobs and personal freedom,  the government instead relaxed restrictions. now, we’re in the thick of  it.  
&gt;  
&gt;last week, with the case counts  rising and icus approaching capacity, the ford government appeared to  panic. the premier on friday announced a series of unpopular and  seemingly counterproductive measures, such as banning outdoor  gatherings, where risk of transmission is known to be lower, while  permitting some indoor workplaces to remain open, where risk is higher.  all of this was accompanied by draconian warnings that police could stop  and fine people who ventured outside their home without sufficient  cause.  
&gt;  
&gt;reaction was so intense –  even strong progressive conservative supporters were appalled by what  appeared to be arbitrary and perverse regulations – that the government  was forced to back down on some measures within a day. now, critics are  calling for mr. ford’s resignation.  
&gt;  
&gt;conservative  governments often arrive in power with a mandate from voters to root  out vested and wasteful interests, both within and outside of  government.  
&gt;  
&gt;the hard part comes with  the transition from the reform phase to the steady-government phase.  some conservative politicians manage that transition: stephen harper,  federally; brad wall in saskatchewan; gordon campbell (a liberal who was  really a conservative) in british columbia.

...

&gt;the  ford government’s problems are not unique: outside atlantic canada,  infection rates have been rising across the country. vaccination levels  are rising, too, and may eventually beat back this third wave. the next  election is more than a year away. the premier and his government may  get through this.  
&gt;  
&gt;or doug ford may meet the same fate as mike harris. if so, the third wave will be his walkerton.",conservatives

&gt; premiers shouldn't try to maximize federal funding to their province? unless it's alberta i guess?

yes. that is absolutely their job. but we have enough evidence that conservative premieres in a few provinces are not doiing that. aren't doing it to reasonable levels and are attempting to use it for politicing against the feds.

examples: kenney doing his budgeting base on $60+ barrel of crude. 

doug ford sitting on 9billion of fed covid response money for \"reasons\" buit then trying to use 6billion to develope a highway to nowhere that nobody wants and all studies show won't help


&gt; the federal government shouldn't support provinces that are backsliding in standard of living, and we should just abandon the have-not provinces and move to the haves?

fed's should be helping provinces no matter what. it's their job. if a province back slides because of it's poor regional leaders, it's more important than ever for the feds to have the people of those provinces back. but it's not easy with how responsibilities are defined right now.

&gt; we should have direct proportional representation? except not now, because the liberals cheated by spending money on things people like, during a pandemic when it's effectively free?

not sure what your point on this. it's a bit.. back and forth. are you supporting the idea that spending to protect the people is nothing more than vote buying, or that you're mocking people who are making this claim?

 &gt; it's bitter, divisive, and nonsensical. at least when we have these types of hacks on the left they're attacking other leftists, not downtrodden provinces and their populations.

the issue with giving everyone in the world a loud voice is that certainly not everyone in the world has bright ideas.  and worse, our social info models demanded bad ideas to be brought forth.  the more sensationalized the info was, the more attention it got.  so you can see where this will inevitably head - the key moment of our crazy information age:  the capitol riot.

as it turns out, that level of crazy isn't a trump-triggered right wing wacko thing only.  it doesn't take too much scouring to find it on the opposite political pole either.

so now, post-capitol, we're leaving it to big tech (and the governments behind them) to funnel our information.  this empowers them greatly of course.  but in exchange for this the people are to be (hopefully) given more security and calm.  so that insane cancel culture becomes less of a thing.  as well as red hat psychosis.

that's not his decision. that's evidence based. i'm guessing you won't find much difference between federal and provincial suggestions, because it's coming from the world's top epidemiologists. here's what the conservative led province of ontario released on the subject: 

&gt;the  national  advisory  committee  on  immunization  (naci)  released  updated guidance  on covid-19 vaccines,  recommending  that  the  interval  between  the  first and  second  dose  be  extended  up  to  4  months,  which  has  been  adopted  in  ontario with  a  limited  number  of  exceptions.  this recommendation  is based  on  the importance  of  maximizing  vaccination  within  the  current  context  of  limited  vaccine supply and  significant  community  transmission.  to  make  this  decision  naci considered: 

&gt;• review of  recent  scientific  studies  of  efficacy  and  effectiveness  of  covid-19 vaccines 

&gt;• real world  effectiveness demonstrating  a  sustained  high level  of  protection after  the  first dose  of  vaccine 

&gt;• immunological  principles and  vaccine  science 

&gt;• modelling  data  from  the  public  health  agency  of  canada  that  examined different  strategies  to  prevent  the  greatest  numbers  of  symptomatic  disease, hospitalizations  and  deaths 

&gt;• vaccine  supply  projections 

&gt;the  vaccine  clinical  advisory  group  brings together  clinical  and  public  health physician  experts  to  provide  recommendations  for  ontario’s  covid-19 vaccine program.  it provides  expert  advice  for  special  populations  and  the  considerations needed  with  respect  to  covid-19 vaccination. 

&gt;the  vaccine  clinical  advisory  group  (vcag)  strongly  supports  the  evidenceinformed  public  health  approach  of  delaying  the  administration  of  the  second  doses to  maximize  the  number  of  individuals  receiving  a  first  dose  of  vaccine  at  this time  of constrained  vaccine supply. 

&gt;the  vcag identified  specific  populations  for  which there  continues  to  be  limited available  data  on  vaccine  efficacy  and  effectiveness,  who  are  at  increased  risk  of severe outcomes  from  covid-19  and  who  may  have  a  suboptimal  immune response  to  vaccines  on the  basis  of  their  underlying  condition. the  vcag  came together  to  discuss recommendations  for  these  populations, recognizing  that  the evidence  is constantly  developing  and  that  recommendations  will  continually  be revisited  as new  data  emerge. 

&gt;the  vcag  analysis  carefully considered  the  constrained  vaccine  supply  and  the impact  of  shortened  dose  intervals  on  the  availability  of  first  doses  for  other  at-risk populations  with  rates  of  high  morbidity  and  mortality  (e.g.  the  elderly). 

&gt;decision  making  on  exceptions  to  the  extended  dose  interval  is  informed  by: 

&gt;-  the vcag’s support for  an  evidence-informed  public  health  approach  of reaching  the  maximum  number  of  individuals with  the  projected  vaccine supply  over  the  next  several  months 

&gt;-  the vcag’s commitment  to  considering  clinical evidence  of  immune response  and  immunological  principles,  balanced by  real-world  evidence  on vaccine  effectiveness.  when  available, the  latter  will be  carefully considered due  to  the  fact  that  the  immune correlates  of  protection  are  not  yet established  for  covid-19. 

&gt;with respect  to  vaccine  supply,  the  vcag  reviewed  ontario’s  projected  vaccine supply  to  understand  the  vaccine  supply  constraints faced  by  ontario  at  this time.   considerations were  raised  with  respect  to  geographic  spread  of  infection  to impacted  populations,  as  recommendations  herein can  impact  vaccine  supply  for first doses.  emphasis  was  made  on  the  temporality  of  the  situation  whereby recommendations  will continually be  re-assessed  to  ensure  they  reflect  emerging science and  vaccine supply  improvements.  for  example,  if  a  change in  vaccine supply  allows  for  quicker  access  to first  doses  for  all  eligible  ontarians, second doses  for  all  ontarians  could  be  administered  prior  to 4 months.

china also promised to start reducing coal consumption between 2026 and 2030, and [south korea](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/south-korea-shuns-coal-power-financing-amid-rising-u-s-pressure) promised to stop financing coal projects abroad, and to announce a stronger climate target later this year (currently targeting 24% reduction by 2030).

some interesting context from andrew leach (quoted in the globe) about canada's climate targets relative to the us:

&gt;unlike the united states, canada has already significantly decarbonized its electricity sector; that’s one of the reasons why reaching its emissions targets will require tougher policies than those south of the border, said andrew leach an associate  professor at the university of alberta. the expansion of the  emissions-intensive oil and gas sector since 2005 makes canada’s path to  reaching its targets even more difficult, he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“if you pick any target, we’re going to need substantially more stringent policies than the u.s. to meet that target,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;for  example, he said the white house would come close to reaching a  30-per-cent drop in emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 with a  $50-per-tonne carbon price, while canada needs a $170-per-tonne carbon  price to do the same.

and a counterpoint:

&gt;kathryn  harrison, a professor of political science at the university of british  columbia, said there are “limits to how much sympathy we can expect from  other countries” for that.  
&gt;  
&gt;“one of  the reasons it’s more costly is that we allowed emissions to increase,  virtually unchecked, from the oil and gas industry and profited  accordingly,” she said.

it’s just stupid though because it makes conservatives look even worse on election day. it’s not changing the number of people who are saying they’ll vote conservative in the sample nor changing where the are located...just their identifiable demographic profile... giving conservative strategists a false sense of optimism. like “our current messaging is really working amongst black trans university aged students [based on what was collected from heteronormative white suburban supporters] we shouldn’t change it”

my point is. canada is child b, and should not be subject to the same/greater penalties as child a.
the argument i am making is around fitting the punishment to the crime. a country that does use a lot for its population (you are correct here) but does not contribute as much harm to world should not be treated like it is causing a big enough impact to be as regulated as it is. 
another example:
there are 2 fires. one burns a unit of 10 wood to create 1000 electricity with 7 pollution. (canada)

economically left would relate to specific economic policies to meet those social goals. naturally, economic policy is intertwined with social policy.

assuming we are staying within the overton window, then left economic policy would be things like progressive taxation where the wealthiest are expected to pay a larger share compared to the poor. (if we go further left, then we would try to eliminate having wealthy and poor). this funding would pay for social welfare programs such as universal healthcare, housing, education, childcare, etc...

most economically left policies also include a strong focus on job creation and worker protections. the idea that everyone has a right to a safe and respectful job, the ability to contribute to their community. (this job protectionism is generally the reasoning behind any left wing anti immigration positions, as mentioned before.)

i would also include regulation under economic policy, and generally the left favours increased regulation that protects the community. for example, limiting emissions in order to combat climate change. it also tries to avoid exploitive imperialist economic policy, like predatory loans to developing nations or taking advantage of depressed wages in the global south.",conservatives

grjk2go,2021-03-19T10:43:04.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention i just wish someone would explain how we got to the conclusion that climate change is real. it's nothing to do with scientists trying to kill big oil and coal. it's the fishing industry, travel industry, agriculture, and so on that need their market forecast. each of these industries pay big money for accurate data to make market decisions. stuff like health of fish stock and migration patterns to help forcast fish yeilds for the year. weather and natural attractions like coral reefs affect tourism. the farmers need to know how much water to preserve or how big a yeilds could be. all this data is collected by university studies who are competing against each other for the best data. they all send out scientists to survey these things and come up with better ways to get accurate data. they then sell this data to industries looking to make accurate market forecast for investment. 

when the data shows your market forecast to yeild less and get more expensive, questions start to get asked. why is the sea getting warmer? why is the water more acidic? why are droughts more prevalent and flooding so extreme year over year? 

this data that the universities are hoarding for the highest bidder is now being bought by non profits to verify their own data, and then you get the ugly truth. we are screwing up our environment and all this amazing data is proof of that.

science isn't something with an agenda, and in this case it was commercial interests that proved climate change it to be true.

grjkrpy,2021-03-19T10:49:30.000-07:00,"conservatives debate whether to declare that 'climate change is real' at policy convention they're not playing with statistics--global warming poses a real threat to human health around the world. here's an article from the world health organization which breaks it down: [https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health). 

global warming is caused by the release of carbon into the atmosphere. carbon is sequestered practically everywhere, including in soils, forests, oceans, etc. some of the largest stores of carbon are fossil fuels--coal, oil, and natural gas--and they've been sequestered for, well, a long time. and now, in little over a century, we've mined (and burned) a lot of these fuels. this has drastically sped up a carbon cycle that usually takes 100-200 million years, and has released an incredible amount of carbon into the atmosphere. 

when carbon builds up in the atmosphere, it creates a greenhouse effect, causing earth to heat up. prior to the industrial age, carbon concentration in the atmosphere was around 280 parts per million (ppm), whereas now it stands at 412 ppm ([source](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/)). this is higher than at anytime in the past 800,000 years ([source](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide)), which means that humans have never lived during a time when carbon concentration in the atmosphere was this high. james hansen, a climate scientist of columbia university, put it like this: “if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted… co2 will need to be reduced… to at most 350 ppm” ([source](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters)). so yeah, like i said, we're at 412 ppm.

let's just say that things are bad, and they're getting worse quickly. as we continue to release carbon into the atmosphere (mostly by burning fossil fuels), we only increase the risk of more and more global warming related deaths each year. we really need to reduce our global carbon emissions, and we need to do it quickly.

grjlk7v,2021-03-19T10:56:56.000-07:00,"with no new budget in two years, justin trudeau has been spending with our eyes closed just a note: overall, we're both talking in my aforementioned grey area, so i don't have any *major* problems with all the stuff you're saying. this is all sitting in \"opinionland\". that said, some places where our opinions differ, below. :)

&gt; a budget is just a plan. no budget in the history of budgets has ever been perfect. there are always unforseen issues/complications that arise out of nowhere that have to be adapted to.

this is fine, sort of. there haven't been this type of unforeseen issues. this is unprecedented. but i'm not saying a budget *wouldn't* have helped at all, i'm basically saying that it would have taken too long to develop to help in any meaningful way. in april 2020, there was no point in taking steps to start a new government-wide budget when the pandemic was in it's early stage. a budget now makes more sense (i guess? it's still a weird time). you could maybe even convince me they should have done some more significant promotion of their plans in the fall (beyond the fes). but at the same time, since it would have been a confidence motion, it's probably not the worst thing that the politics got left out of it.

&gt; but what she's really saying is that the budget process has a lot of checks and balances that would have caught a lot of mistakes the liberals made with their pandemic spending.

all of those checks and balances still exist. this why i don't totally get her accountability bit. it's still parliament. there are still mps doing their job. they're all still a part of the process. but she seems to mean a more general sense of accountability, not the specific role of mps to hold the gov to account. so i guess fair enough.

&gt; things like cerb going to prisonners, cews not paying enough initally, the whole we charity debacle etc etc could have all been sorted out by the budget approval process.

a very much doubt that any of these would have been solved by a budget developed in the early weeks of the pandemic (which, i'd doubt is even possible in that timeframe anyway). would the budget have known to develop cerb? maybe, but not as quickly as what we got. would it be able to tell us that we would need to extend it at least twice? what about reworking our ei? how about cews? how about crcb, crsb, and the other programs? many of these were developed in response to things we were just coming to realize as the pandemic unfolded (and probably still are). i don't understand how anyone would have planned for this in any meaningful way and still act quickly.

more importantly, would a budget have done all of those things, be completed relatively quickly, and and pass in a minority government? cause if not, we would have had a pandemic election that probably no one would have wanted.

the problems with we had nothing to do with a budget, so i'm not sure how that applies.

&gt; to me it comes across like you believe the government did the best job possible given the circumstances. there was no way for them to know or anticipate the problems they faced; the budget is a tool that could have helped them anticipate some of those problems.

pfft, maybe? probably not? i don't know. but that's beside the point. i'm saying a *budget* is not the thing that would have fixed all of this. an effective public service in key departments, a cabinet that is ready to turn advice into something impactful, and a parliament that is ready to sit, debate, and vote as appropriate is what helps everyone get through this i'd say.

&gt; but it wouldn't have hurt.

it almost certainly would have meant cerb not being implemented as quickly as it did, and that's enough to not even bother.",liberals

to be honest, would anyone actually believe them even if they started coming up with creative or constructive ideas? 

the problem with the conservatives, imo, boils down to harper: harper essentially constructed and controlled the cpc in such a way that the reform part of the party was protected from the electorate and, in doing so, allowed it to fester. here we are some twenty years or so later, and it's pretty obvious to a lot of people that a good chunk of the cpc are, generously, borderline bigots.

1 - immigrants do indeed provide economic benefit, especially since 2006. this fact is being exploited by the liberals to try to prop up the economy (precovid) and they take it to an extreme which is somewhat unsustainable. 

2. our dollar being above the us was more to do with the collapse of the us than our dollar. and yes oil prices were high and that helped but they've been high before without that happening. and it's also a bad thing. 

3. incomes are absolutely not stagnant. sorry - you're just plain wrong there. they've been increasing faster than inflation for at least 15 years or so.

the immigrant communities appear to appreciate having good laws that make sense and result in good immigration and immigrants. they supported harper's policies strongly even though they were more restrictive.  having said that, i think immigration is something we win points on by doing a good job between elections rather than making it a plank in an election. and our policy should be simple - we bring in as many highly qualified productive people as the circumstances call for and to maintain growth in the population (seeing as we're not doing it ourselves). as to shifting cultural issues - that's always happening regardless.",liberals

a poll that shows the ppc up 4 and the ndp down 4 could indicate that 4 points worth of the ndps supporters have gone to the ppc. or it could indicate they lost 4 points to the liberals who lost 4 to the tories who lost 4 to the ppc. you can't draw *any* conclusions about whose support is going where from looking at changes in voting intention.

it was a little weird the initial order was so open-ended in the first place. when flags are ordered half-masted due to a vip death, it’s normally “until sunset on the day of the funeral.” they’re half-masted from sunrise to sunset on remembrance day and national days of mourning. in the case of the gravesite unearthed in bc, a lot of provincial governments and municipalities did a 215-hour half masting - one hour for each child discovered. by ordering federal flags half masted “until further notice,” the government created an awkward bind for itself whereby a political decision would have to be taken to go back to full mast.

&gt;oil tanker traffic on the west coast is tremendously unpopular outside every province but alberta, and has been for decades. and frankly, it is easy to understand why. it was unreasonable to try to propogate it to begin with.

[here's a comprehensive pipeline poll from abacus in 2016, a few months before trudeau announced the northern gateway decision](https://abacusdata.ca/pipeline-politics-in-2016/). 68% supported building new pipelines, with that number being 71% in bc. for northern gateway itself, in bc, support was 30%, with an additional 28% saying they would support under certain conditions, while opposition was only 25% (remaining 17% were unsure).

&gt;[...]

&gt;the liberals’ proposed bank tax, which the party said would take effect in 2022-23, appears to pull forward a partial version of a comprehensive corporate tax hike that was likely already in the cards, noce notes.

&gt;“given that the federal government is in desperate need for more revenue to fund its deficit spending and that a global minimum rate would make canada generally no less competitive if it were to increase its current rate by three percentage points on a subsector of firms that post more than $1 billion in profits … trudeau’s announcement is politically astute, but dishonest in its purpose,” noce said in additional comments via email.

i'm a bit confused here; most of the article talks about how it's targeting a specific industry, worries about rising costs, etc. and then there's the suggestion that the proposed tax increase is likely pulling forward an agreement that's intended to raise the corporate tax rate in 2023. the primary difference being that we'd start seeing the benefits from the tax earlier (in part since its only applying to banks and insurance companies) essentially a year earlier than what's already signed. 

even if its true, i'm not really sure what's \"dishonest\" about this change, save that trudeau hasn't already pointed out that his government has committed to raising the corporate tax rate in a couple of years. instead, they want to hustle forward and do it now. i'm not even sure how it would negatively impact anything, since noce seems to argue here, the tax rates are going to be going up *everywhere* which, in my mind, limits what can really be passed on. furthermore, while you might get a year specifically targeting banks and insurance companies, this makes it sound like its only a temporary singling out for a tax increase that's already planned.",liberals

incorrect.

if queen's park and parliament hill agree, this can be changed at any time with a simple vote of the legislature and parliament. constitutional provisions that are in force in only one province may be amended or repealed by that province and ottawa acting in concert. there is no requirement for a referendum. 

there is no catholic political power as such, and there's no obstacle to simply ditching the board. catholics do not need to agree. the legislature can simply make the change.

catholic schools endure because the pc's, liberals and ndp all say they should. there is majority political consensus in ontario in favour of catholic schools. while the majority of people would favour their abolishment, most of those people don't actually care that strongly about the issue, so those in favour of the separate boards, who care very, very deeply, are allowed to have their way. 

&gt; in quebec, the protestant minoritiy community agreed in 1997 to get rid of similar constitutional guarantees and replace them with linguistic boards. you'l have t do the same in ontario if you want things to change.

again, not entirely correct. quebec is a unique circumstance, and the case that decided it was based on a deep dive into history. the court decided that the purpose of the protections in quebec was to protect the two communities' cultural, linguistic and, yes, religious independence, which could be accomplished with separate language boards.

&gt; canadian foreign minister stéphane dion has also supported the lifting of canadian economic sanctions but voiced concerns about iran's role in the middle east, its standoff with israel, its ballistic missile program and its worsening human rights record. in his march 2016 speech at the university of ottawa, dion said that breaking off diplomatic ties with iran \"had no positive consequences for anyone\"—not for canadians, not for iranians, not for israelis and not for global security. he has also made calls to start re-engaging with iran in order \"to play a useful role in that region of the world.\"[51][52]

the result is that the chinese communist party decided to resort to a literally ancient form of diplomacy which is hostage diplomacy. there is simply no trust in our extradition process from the point of view of the chinese communist party.

in turn, this has forced trudeau’s hand because he cannot release meng unilaterally regardless because to do so would put a price on every canadian abroad. simply releasing her would magnify the leverage other countries would have if they kidnapped canadians to extract concessions in other cases.

the reality and this is very hard for many canadians to accept, is that canada is a vassal state. this harkens back to colonial times when the master was the uk and now, that has shifted to the us. canada benefits greatly from this relationship with the us. it, for example allows us to pay more for healthcare as opposed to security and the military. in the other hand, being nominally ‘independent’ has allowed us to have disagreements with the us and to avoid certain conflicts.

while i don't think hostage diplomacy is good, it is certainly effective. if the chinese feel that they are being wronged, this is one way to gain leverage. if it wasn't the two michael's wouldn't they have just done something else to gain leverage?

&gt; simply releasing her would magnify the leverage other countries would have if they kidnapped canadians to extract concessions in other cases.

i seriously disagree here, with this kind of rhetoric no citizens of any country should be travelling anywhere, as to not be exposed to risk of kidnapping. more importantly, we could just do the same thing, it results in stalemates? this whole thing just feels so incredibly ineffective. if it wasn't hostage diplomacy it would be something else, land disputes, trade disputes, intellectual property disputes. 

&gt; the reality and this is very hard for many canadians to accept is that canada is a vassal state.

yes, definitely agree. that's why our foreign policy is so counter to public sentiment. take bolivia this past year, or our propping up of guiado for venezuela. or our knowing wmds were fake at the time but still going along for the sake of going along. we benefit from mining interests in our relationship.

&gt; it, for example allows us to pay more for healthcare as opposed to security and the military.

here i'd disagree, military spending is so ridiculously overblown. through the us we are the destabilizing force that always jumps between enemies to justify more and more fear and spending. this does hurt us too as we should be prioritizing things that people actually need instead of waving our neighbours dick around to appease them.

i'm not fan of the government in china, but we can't just call something illegitimate and criminal in nature to rile up support. our own government and the us government does many criminal things (not that they are always equivalent). we do not take other countries seriously when they would point out these actions, so why should china?

in china, the economic system puts government/party above industry, followed by lowly people like us. here industry has greater power than government/party. we are competing against state capitalism. they have higher social spending to be fair. as for fascist, yeah i could agree with that, but many have been calling elements of the us and canadian governments fascist for decades. particularly for treatment of poor and marginalized groups and aggression overseas.

meng was detained as a result of a legal us request.  the request was made according to treaties we signed with them and the process of our law is clear.

we didn't go along with the invasion of iraq because we didn't agree with the wmd argument and the usa was very upset with us at the time and they punished us accordingly ( the usa fights economically with us rather than by kidnapping citizens ).

china doesn't care about our law or about our treaties with the us but they do care about the reverse - our ability to ignore us pressure ( e.g. steel and aluminum ) and keep our diplomatic word to them.  the usa doesn't always care about our treaties with them either and our approach is the same.

their concern is that we aren't being fair and that we're abusing their citizen because we can to make our ally happy.  and so they take some of ours hostage to make sure that we behave.

it's part of both our nations' geopolitical and diplomatic dynamic and through this china will hopefully learn that canada enforces its laws no matter who is upset by them.  and that we have fair processes by which we can reconsider our laws and that we are best dealt using those diplomatic channels than with harder power.",liberals

i can see the balance here in that regard, for emphasizes soft power. i just doubt that this does that, we are in a terrible trade agreement with china, we call them out for genocide but they are a major trading partner. this feels like a distraction to get people riled up while business continues as usual.

i was chatting with someone here aa few weeks ago about how after tiannamen canada took a hard stance, but ultimately the main concern of not going too far in punishing china was to prevent a major impact to commercial interests. 

if we are taking this seriously then we would be decoupling our economies and applying sanctions (which who knows if these would do anything). this whole topic concerns me as anti-asian hate crimes has risen a lot, people do not understand the nuances of our relationship and are instead internalizing china bad. with covid and these escalating tensions people become openly hostile to asian people here, often indiscriminately. this feels counter-productive and i hope we can move to better politics then dick waving.",liberals

this is good, this resolution was stupid. if it failed to make it to the floor, chances are it wasn't popular to begin with. if it was suppressed, despite my opposition, i'd say it isn't fair. in a democracy, we are supposed to debate issues. again, my theme of optics mattering reigns here as well. i think a lot of the more idealistic new democrats seem to have forgotten that instead of abolishing the military, the ndp could come up with a plan on how to use the military, which can include not entering wars and just focusing on upgrading national defence, which i argue is leagues more popular than scrapping it.

i wonder why people are suggesting this before suspending arms to an even bigger middle eastern country that kills journalists, lgbt and does not like canada. hmm, why? it's a mystery!

wtf? *this* is a major political party's huge concern? what working class voter in canada gives a shit about this? this is probably the **worst** optics proposal out of all of them, because it is coming across as antisemitic itself, considering that antisemitism is a huge problem in the world and is completely and utterly unacceptable.

&gt;on the grounds it is used to chill criticism of israeli policy.

from their [website](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definitions-charters/working-definition-antisemitism):

\"manifestations might include the targeting of the state of israel, conceived as a jewish collectivity. **however, criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.** antisemitism frequently charges jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame jews for “why things go wrong.” it is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\"

there is nothing controversial with this addendum. it literally states that you can criticize israel and not be antisemitic.

&gt; \"i don't think it's going to overshadow, because we've got a lot of really important and exciting policy debates on issues that impact people right now in the pandemic,\" singh said in a recent interview.

good, i hope so. our cities have become unaffordable. the pandemic is not being managed well and will have many aftereffects. income inequality is rising. the israel-palestine debate is the among last one we should be dabbling in as canadians, we have so many issues to fix.

* uneven treatment of male and female ministers turns back the clock on women's struggle for equality.
* during the 2018 general election campaign, liberals christine st-pierre and marwah rizqy questioned legault’s real beliefs about equality of the sexes. as if to prove them right, legault blew a gasket.
* danielle mccann, arguably the most qualified person to have ever been named health minister in quebec, had just finished shepherding the province through the first wave of the pandemic when she, too, was sacked by legault. dr. horacio arruda, whose track record was spotty at best, had no trouble holding onto his job.
* when the tragic death of joyce echaquan in a joliette hospital made the headlines, indigenous affairs minister sylvie d’amours was promptly shown the door. no second chance there.
* last week, photos were published of legault and economic development minister pierre fitzgibbon in paris in 2019 with the head of an investment fund headquartered in a tax haven. fitzgibbon owns shares in the fund that he’s still refusing to sell despite successive rulings of the ethics commissioner. both fitzgibbon and legault have thumbed their noses at ethics commissioner ariane mignolet. after all, what do girls know about big business dealings? and … boys will be boys!
* legault’s record of forgiving incompetence or ethical lapses in his male cabinet ministers, while lowering the boom on women even for the slightest perceived shortcoming, is becoming a defining element of his administration.
* we have been soft-shoeing our way into a new duplessisme for the better part of three years. this gloaming to la grande noirceur 2.0 turns back the clock on women’s struggle for equality.

i used to think that mulcair's bridges to the quebec liberal party were burned over his resignation as environment minister on principle when the charest government cynically turned a provincial park over to condo developers. this piece makes it sound like he's ready to take on legault the way he took on harper. ideologically, mulcair is a liberal which makes him a bad fit for the ndp/quebec soilidaire. his tolerance for graft and grifters is more ndp/qubec solidaire, though. it makes him a bit of a political orphan, though, being a liberal with a sense of ethics.",liberals
