time to bite the bullet and just go full tilt into setting ourselves up with modern equipment. or at least as modern as we can afford. we can't assume america will always have our back anymore. this has become startling clear with the way biden has been between canada and australia as of late.

if we play our cards right, we can catapult ourselves into a noteworthy position of power, without having to fund our allies and enemies to do it. the avro arrow is something people often bring up in regards to our ingenuity as a nation; but we have other companies making some really neat stuff too if you dare to look around for it.

what's more is we have the resources to do it all self sufficiently. we just have to double down on industry to be able to extract, refine, transport and use it all. luckily we do have some of that started already, though the infrastructure connecting it all via our roads and rails could be better.

trudeau shouldn’t be grabbing people in parliament like he did and should have been reprimanded but to act like someone was injured when an mp left feeling overwhelmed after accidental contact is just playing up the events.

i’d argue the people being childish that day were the mp’s blocking people from returning to their seats to delay a vote they didn’t want to happen. not to mention “physically force another mp to vote for his legislation” makes it sound like he was out back breaking people’s knees if they didn’t give him what he wanted.

ho86amh,2021-12-11T16:42:05.000-08:00,"[deleted by user] to be honest, i don't have too big of a problem with kenney. i prefer him over all the other premiers (i actually resent ford) and know that he is doing his best with the situation that's been handed to him.

jean is a libertarian, and is mostly where i lean myself. if either man ran alberta, i don't think it would matter much. like the top things would be covid-19 policies for me, which is where i've been disappointed with kenney but again, he's been much better than ford. that said, jean admitted [that things wouldn't be much different under him](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/brian-jean-says-he-opposes-mandatory-covid-19-vaccinations-expanding-albertas-vaccine-passport-program) depending on the circumstances. either way, i would vote for either of them.

in terms of social conservatism, i think it's really important to define terms. for example, i wouldn't consider myself a social conservative cause i support abortion, gay marriage, premarital sex, contraception, etc. however, as we shift left, this term becomes a bigger umbrella. i don't believe in gender ideology, white privelege, anti-patriotism and all the other woke nonsense the left peddles. does that make me a social conservative? what i'm getting at is: \"who is jean referring to?\" if he's referring to anti-gay and prolife activists (which is what most people think of when they think socon), then that's not a bad hill to place yourself on politically. it's what harper did to ensure an election. 

i don't think brian jean is woke, so all i'm saying is that \"anti-socon\" needs to be better defined. in fact, his schools comment clearly show that he isn't on board with this woke shit. it also clearly appears that jean's contempt was with homophobes so i think this is all hyperbolic; jean seems actually pretty based. the socons should alsp know by now that any conservative party is not going to implement any socon policy; what they'll do is delay implementing socilly progressive policies until the next leftist party gets in, which is the best you can hope for in canada.",conservatives

i agree. in fact, reforming our foster care system should be a top priority and can make conservatives stand out as \"compassionate\", which i sometimes feel they get a bad wrap for not being.

also, i think we should focus on giving easy and free access to contraceptions (e.g. iuds). embracing the whole sexual and women's health aspect would be popular with their demographic. plus, if socons really want to deter abortions in canada, that would be the way to do it (so people don't get pregnant in the first place).",conservatives
