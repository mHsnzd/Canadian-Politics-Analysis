at the risk of sounding too maudlin, the us and uk have betrayed us when it comes to vaccines. it's not something we should forget with a state visit or syrupy words. remember how up in arms we all were when trump described the integrated us/canada aluminum production environment as a national security threat? we all knew he was just blowing smoke for the purposes of trade negotiation. but at least he didn't smile and shake hands with a knife behind his back. he was open with the knife. biden will say all the right things about our close relationship, maybe even quoting jfk. i wish he would just be honest.

and subsequently missed it and managed to get smacked in the face by the rebound.

as you mentioned, this is such a nothing issue that it's not going to resonate with anyone who isn't already hyper partisan. 

it's also another issue that has been fabricated by the cpc to be much bigger and fantastical than it actually is, which is basically the only thing they are capable of doing and something that people seem to be getting tired of (at least looking at the polls). it's also pretty easily disproven (lots of places didn't organize them previously due to covid, not because they are \"anti-canada or whatever stupid thing he's saying now) and is incredibly bad optics to lambast some municipalities, who are trying to be respectful by not hosting parties right after the uncovering of a ton of unmarked residential school graves, for not being \"proud of canada\". talk about tone deaf. the only people who would be offended enough at something like that (and care enough to follow the story) to actually swing their vote are already firmly on the right side of his camp. 

third, he's now offered up some fantastic rebuttal material for the other parties when the cpc and their supporters accuse \"the leftists\" of virtue signaling. this is a stupid, superficial farce that can be brought up to point out the hypocrisy if he trots out those types of accusations, which seem to account for a large portion of his platform. 

lastly, and most importantly, the fact that *this* is the main issue that has gripped the conservative party leader's attention is pathetically emblematic of the issues with the party. we just experienced a global pandemic, the economy is in tatters, people can barely afford housing, the country is currently an oven, putting a highlight on climate change, the strain on and failings of our healthcare system have been put under a microscope, and serious discussions about the horrific treatment of indigenous groups and about reconciliation are dominating the political sphere, but the cpc is totally focused on combating some inconsequential, specious issue instead. i don't think you could find a better example of what a useless joke the cpc has become if you tried.",conservatives
