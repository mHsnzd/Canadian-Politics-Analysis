i've transcribed the section:

**harper:** i would argue that real conservatism is actually populist conservatism. it is non-theoretical, and it is targeted towards (kinda) the interests of ordinary people and their concerns. and, that is what i would argue populist conservatism is.

**shapiro:** so there are a lot of folks on the right, they hear something like ‘non-ideological and more pragmatical’ what they hear is 'government.’ because typically when folks say, \"i’m a pragmatic conservative,\" it sounds like john kasich in ohio, \"what i really want is to expand medicare. what i really want is to ensure that everyone is taken care of by the government.” where do you think the distinctions are between…

**harper:** that’s a great question because often you see the same thing happen in canada. ***\"i’m a pragmatist,\" or \"i’m a centrist,\" and of course, coming from the mouth of a conservative, it often means actually they are left of center but somehow want to be in a conservative party.***",conservatives

that’s kind of how canada’s relationship with quebec goes, sometimes. it has four steps, usually.

i'm amazed at how difficult it is for some people to conceptualize a province actually utilizing leverage to gain concessions in a federative system. it's not rocket science. it's really not that deep.

&gt; thus, the latest installment in the ritual humiliation/compensation/extortion/capitulation rinse cycle. quebec’s **crypto-separatist government** wants to change the constitution to recognize quebec as “a nation,” and crush the piddling anglophone minority in quebec. justin trudeau’s response?

&gt; bien sur! allez-y!

secret. separatists. fucking. everywhere.

this guy's understanding of qc politics is so two-dimensional and low resolution, it's laughable. you're either a simp for canada or a hardline separatist. no in-between. autonomist nationalists are just secret separatists. latent sovereigntists who bide their time.

*crypto-separatists*. i'm speechless.

&gt; it wasn’t quebec’s government. with the exception of the **blessed jean charest era**, quebec’s government has always embraced the strategy of humiliation, compensation, extortion and capitulation. it works for them.

now i know this guy's a joke.

&gt; and canada, as we know it, is going to be even less of a country as a result.

or, perhaps, the federative pact behind canada was never as solid as he might've thought. but i wouldn't count on him to have the insight to go that far beyond his binary vision of canadian politics.",liberals

it’s unfortunate that you’ve had to resort to insults. i will turn the other cheek and not engage in that behaviour. my point with the contradiction thing was this:


you said: “i have paid more than enough in taxes to keep myself alive, if that's what i chose.”


followed immediately with: “don't like paying for me to stay alive…”



those two statements are completely contradictory, if you actually paid enough in taxes to fund your care, i wouldn’t be technically paying for it. but by the looks of it, you’ve conceded that you were likely mistaken on how much it would cost to keep you alive.


&gt; the best part about private insurance is i don't need to give a fuck about what you think about where i spend my money. useless busy bodies and wanna be tyrants want control over other people's lives.

not really relevant. i didn't say you were unlikable or that you hated anyone. but you were trolling.

&gt; if we all sit in echochambers and refuse to associate with each other, that will just lead to problems.

you talk like a conservative in that respect, but honestly i don't really have any faith that you mean that. you very clearly started off attempting to claim that social conservatives represent the base of the party and trying to dial it back later is nonsense. that's not a rational position for someoone who's 'just here to exchange ideas''. 

and we both know your attempt to claim that 40 percent of the cpc is social conservative based on trying to combine leslyn and sloan's numbers was just stupid, especially as leslyn campaigned that she wouldn't be doing anything socally conservative. you might have at least had a defensible position if you argued sloan's supporters were primarly social conservatives, it's his 'thing' and his primary position. but leslyn's was not. a lot of people who are not socially conservative like her. 

then there's your other 'questionable' numbers - right down to trying to suggest the libs are around 40 points right now and that they're strong when even a cursory glance at the numbers demonstrates otherwise. 

so no, you don't come across as an honest player at all. you are very clearly not just here to exchange ideas. and yes there's trolling involved. 

&gt;as for the polling situation. so far, the abacus one seems to be an outlier. 

lol - no, it does not. nanos has them close as well as do most of the others, certainly less than 7 percent. so there's no indication that it's an outlier any more than the ipsos which you posted.  see - once again a dishonest statement. 

&gt;polling within four is inline with the average,

really -because that's not what you went with. so - what you're saying is you went with a poll you knew to be outside the average? quelle suprise. 

&gt; i suspect it will increase, especially since the vaccine turbulence is behind us.

well what you mean is you hope that's the case. suspicions are what those of us who use facts have. and second, you're assuming the 'turbulence' (nice word for incompetence leading to death) is in fact over. i would not make that assumption at this time. 

we'll see - i suspect that despite being weak he'll probably go to an election in april/may. his situation deteriorates over time, this is probably as good as it possibly gets for him so it makes sense to try to pick a good window and go. if he can deliver the vaccines by the end of march and claim he's done his job, immediately callng it after that would probably be his smartest move, while covid still seriously hampers the other parties ability to campaign.

h5wtfot,2021-07-20T05:26:47.000-07:00,"are the rich really getting poorer in canada? a fascinating article from michael smart. if you look at the official statistics, you might be surprised to find that the top one-percent's share income has actually gone *down*:

&gt;the top one per cent of canadians earned 10.0 per cent of total incomes in 2018, about the same as their 10.2 per cent share in 1998.

yet the conventional wisdom is that income inequality is growing. how can this be so?

smart suggests that the answer may lie in incorporation. the number of incorporated individuals has grown dramatically in recent years, perhaps because doing so allows the manipulation of reported personal income using various strategies detailed by smart.

the takeaway is that there is strong evidence of a shift of personal income to business income, which greatly lowers the tax paid by high-income individuals. smart makes a rough adjustment to account for this, and finds that the top one-percent income share likely has risen to around 14% today, from 10% in 1998. moreover, this income has not be taxed at nominal rates.

it's thus unsurprising that while trudeau's tax raise on the top 1% of earners generated little blowback, the more obscure changes to small business accounting rules resulted in serious opposition. if we want to tax the one-percent, this is where we need to look.",liberals

i think of tmx as a national-unity issue. rule #1 of canadian foreign policy is to avoid splitting the country, and the fact that climate action is far less wrenching for bc and quebec (which have lots of hydro) than for alberta and saskatchewan (which depend on fossil fuels) is a big challenge. support for tmx is what got the alberta ndp government on board with the national carbon price floor; since alberta had elected conservative governments for the previous 40 years, this was a once-in-a-generation window of opportunity.

i also think the federal ndp isn't in a great position to criticize the liberals on this front, since the bc ndp is backing coastal gaslink, and it was the alberta ndp that wanted tmx. in fact the federal ndp national director, anne mcgrath, was rachel notley's deputy chief of staff.

canada's climate policy isn't \"don't burn fossil fuels at all,\" or \"don't fly.\" it's \"polluter pays,\" with the price steadily ramping up to decrease the total amount of pollution.

the reason people like naomi klein dislike carbon pricing is that the flip side is, \"if you can pay, you can pollute.\" sounds like you dislike it for the same reason. http://induecourse.ca/naomi-klein-this-changes-everything/

&gt; so we keep coming back to the basic puzzle. what’s wrong with a properly designed, properly implemented carbon pricing scheme?
&gt; 
&gt; the answer that i finally settled on is that these pricing schemes violate a moral intuition that most of us have, but that klein applies in a particularly uncompromising way. despite her endorsement of the “polluter pays” principle, she actually rejects one of the logical implications of it, which is that if you’re willing to pay, then you should be able to pollute. the moral intuition that conflicts with it is that if a particular action is immoral, that in itself gives you reason enough not to do it. you cannot therefore demand that others give you an incentive to stop. on the contrary, if you fail to stop, others are entitled to punish you. for example, klein points out that we did not get rid of slavery by pricing it out of the market (462-463), or by taxing it, but by abolishing the practice. she sees environmental regulation in the same way. for example, she asks the rhetorical question: “why aren’t we ordering companies to stop putting our future at risk, instead of bribing and cajoling them?”(225). so fundamentally, i think the reason that she opposes carbon pricing is simply that she finds the very idea morally offensive – like having to pay a kidnapper to give you back your child.
&gt; 
&gt; she is not alone in this regard, lots of people start out with the same intuition. but the argument that dismantles it is well-known, to the point where it is really a bread-and-butter point in environmental economics. the “abolitionist” approach only works in cases where a substance or practice can be, or needs to be, banned entirely – like slavery. releasing carbon dioxide or methane, however, is not intrinsically harmful, and no one wants to reduce it to zero. and while there are some things that could be banned outright (one can imagine coal mining being banned, for instance), there are many others that cannot. consider the case of concrete, which is responsible for approximately 5% of global co2 emissions (a byproduct of the chemical reaction that takes place when it hardens). obviously no one wants to ban concrete – not even klein, since she speaks in glowing terms about “straw bale” construction, which typically involve encasing the bales in cement after they are stacked. so what we need to do is increase the price of concrete, so that a person who is trying to decide whether to use a cement or a clay-based mix on the walls of their new straw-bale home will be pushed to choose clay, on the grounds that it does not produce an atmospheric externality.
&gt; 
&gt; in other words, what we want to be doing with greenhouse gas emissions is not banning them, but *discouraging* them, perhaps even *strongly discouraging* them. the appropriate policy response is therefore to put a price on them, or to increase the price that we have. this is such a basic point that it is somewhat embarrassing to be having to make it. ultimately, however, the only way i can make sense of klein’s position is to assume that she doesn’t appreciate this point. (for those who have a serious interest in the question of when we should “ban” and when we should “price” pollution, i would recommend as a point of departure an article by john braithwaite called “the limits of economism in controlling harmful corporate conduct” — this is what i normally assign to my students when discussing the question.)",liberals

the government of canada and the bank of canada tend to think of mmt as fringe ideology of low interest beyond what in it replicates basic modern keynesian thought. what they looked to do in the pandemic is to stabilize demand by replacing lost wages and stabilize future supply by keeping disruption to existing firms from the shock to a minimum by strongly encouraging firms to keep their existing staff on payroll. pre-pandemic they've also gone along with a fairly mainstream view that a relatively small deficit that keeps debt to gdp and debt to revenues declining is nothing to worry about, your fiscal position is improving not declining even if the debt number is regularly increasing.

&amp;#x200b;

basicaly if they were mmt followers, they'd be looking at a large ongoing deficit and talking about inflation as their fiscal anchor. instead they're doing things that saltwater anglosphere economists would view as wise policy. the top line number in the past year were huge, but that was in the context of an extreme crisis that called for it and their ongoing thinking is pretty conventional and not what kelton would advocate.",liberals

generally though, it should be understood that this decision has nothing to do with the liberal party or their polls as you and many others in this thread have implied.  vaccine distribution strategies are handled by the provinces.  this move was made first by dr bonnie henry in bc, who is in close contact with the bccdc where the scientific basis for this strategy was developed by dr. danuta skowronski.  in bc it was decided that the risk of decreased immunity from extending period between shots was outweighed by the risk of vaccinating half as many people.  it is a contensious decision, even among scientists, but it was made by experts in epidemiolgy, not by trudeau.  other provinces are following the lead, likely because it is actually a good idea.

it is true that the immunity may decline after 2 months, but by then covid-19 presence in the community will have been reduced as a result of twice as many people being vaccinated.  furthermore, by then it will be summer and it will be easier to fight (as was shown here last summer).  it should also be noted that the 2nd shot was given so soon in the trials to speed up the process.  if they had done the trials with 4 months between shots, the vaccines likely would not even be in use for the general public today.  so, although it is true that the data we have is based to 2 shots given 3 weeks apart, that timeframe was not based on increasing effectiveness of the vaccine.

dr. danuta skowronski from the article:

\"she said that longer intervals between a first and a second dose  of a vaccine are generally preferred because shorter intervals can  interfere with the immune boost response and longer intervals are often  associated with ultimately higher antibody levels\"

ultimately, they can keep looking at the immunization data and change their policy to 2 months or 3 months if the data warrants it.",liberals

this is not because the conservative party is racist. the 100% white mps (this time around) of the bloc québécois are also not a function of a racist political party. 

it is a function of where the parties are winning. the conservative caucus of 2011 was much more diverse, when mps from places like brampton and surrey were elected into the party. the same goes for the ndp, by the way. their 2011 caucus was much more diverse than their current one. and when the bloc used to perform better in montréal, before 2008, they had lots of visible minority members too, including vivian barbot, canada's first visible minority leader of a federal party.

if there was a real purple wave, with the ppc winning urban ridings, you would have african refugees and muslims winning too for the \"racist party\". i did research into every one of their candidates before.

he38v7q,2021-09-23T23:37:05.000-07:00,"canadians end up in icu after attending ‘covid party’ i only just had my kid but it factored into how much we were willing to pay for our home in 2019. 

our concerns back then seem so quaint now. we went over our original hopeful budget by 35k and paid 11% over listing price. we figured, well we're down the street from one grandparent and 10-15 minute drive from the other set. we'll call it mortgaging our childcare, and it was still well below the banks max approval. 

but thinking parental leave and a wedding and ofc baby costs we were careful. 

but if i wasn't even thinking of a home then ofc i wouldn't be worried about childcare. 

at the same time though, there is a lot of housing hyperbole on reddit. this isn't to mean housing affordability isn't an issue, but it is \\*very\\* new as a national issue. prior to covid i'd say it was mostly gta and nearby /gva and nearby, with a sprinkling of a heating up secondary but still big cities issue (halifax, montreal, ottawa, etc). 

the pandemic turned the roughly 10ish % yoy of the growing cities like ottawa up too many notches and did the same literally everywhere else. i know that my house is already worth almost 40% more than when i bought it. while a bit smaller than the neighbour's house, they bought last winter at almost 250k more than my house. thats ... insane to me. 

but the number of people who said \"the liberals ignored the problem for 6 years!!!111!\" i was like .. bro, until 18 months ago homes were mostly in touch with the economy in many places across the country. even ottawa's price increases, they made sense given our median income here prior to covid and i would have considered ottawa \"cheap\" just 4 years ago to boot given income levels. i think once covid is over we'll see some chilling of many markets. the question is whether they'll slowly decline or come down quick. 

i have a feeling the policies to be instituted are going to try to do it slowly. a rapid decrease in home values has serious negative implications for the stability of our economy. reddit folks are gonna be mad, for sure. but you can't just chop 25% of the existing home values overnight and, while likely still higher than what people paid before covid, this would be a massive hit to the economy. enough people would start dropping the keys off at the bank that we'd be in a sort of near 2008 level home default rate and it would spiral for a bit and have many knock on effects. 

personally, i think the goal is going to be some sort of slow 5% yoy type decline that slowly brings most of the country into line over a few years that along with inflation will calm the whole thing. a combination of not letting bid wars get too out of hand, reducing speculation (a yoy decline would drop speculation also), and increasing supply even a little bit would help a lot. at least here in ottawa there are a ton of new builds but resales are brutally low. if resales were their historic average along with new builds we wouldn't have this issue here. but alas, when people speculate and hold and refuse to resale...",liberals

another losing proposition of the ndp is their penchant for strong centralization. the bloc's purpose is de-centralization, towards a true federation, and it's not a mystery why such a party sprung up in quebec. ignore that sensibility at your own party's peril.

yes.

&gt;examples include areas like markham, which has a very large asian community. there is a large proportion of the population that favors policies that encourage small businesses, for example tax credits. another example of a population that would be more culturally conservative would the the large proportion of philipino immigrants in areas like etobicoke who tend to be very catholic. policies which streamline immigration, while retaining its merit-based fundamentals, would be popular, as well as ensuring remittances are easy to transfer to family back home without undue regulation.

interesting observation, which i also share. however, i do believe that the cpc **needs** to take a different stance on immigration contrary to the liberals, because whether people like it or not, immigration is a core issue for many in the conservative base. i think that the focus should be on immigration that *compliments* natural population growth, rather than streamlining immigration. streamlining immigration does not address the concerns *regarding* immigration within the conservative base, which is a sense of displacement. whether or not you believe this to be true, this is in fact a concern. this shouldn't be such a controversial position to take because [a majority of canadians (63%) are in favour of more limited immigration](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadians-favour-limiting-immigration-1.5177814). one idea that i've always thought was sensible, and would have widespread support, are more stringent language requirements (english and french) for immigrant applicants, which would be more in line with australia, and this is a sensible policy as linguistic fluency is **necessary** for tolerance and co-operation. we should give priority for fluent, or native, english speakers, and french speakers. currently, our base language requirements for immigration is merely elementary-level english, and, or, french.

&gt;more culturally conservative communities in the greater gta which the liberals have a lockdown on right now include sikhs and more conservative muslim communities. the cpc needs to identify social issues which are important with these groups and align with the more traditional christian conservative base in the party. protection of religious freedom, in areas like education or expression, are an easy example.

this idea sounds good on paper, but very difficult in practice, and it sounds rather naïve. please consider doing research on the relationship amongst abrahamic religions, because its extremely complex and sophisticated, and this is not an understatement.

&gt;finding policies that appeal across diverse fiscally and socially conservative groups is the path to victory for the cpc in ontario.

guk98cw,2021-04-14T12:30:35.000-07:00,"alberta ndp would likely form majority if election held today, new poll suggests i think it's a very simple explanation. unlike countries like the us and the uk where party id is very strong and interwoven with cultural/class identity, most canadians aren't that partisan. this is what allows for frequent massive swings, like the lpc doubling in votes between 2011 and 2015. or the ontario liberals having their vote share halved between 2014 and 2018. or quebec ditching a century of liberal support for the pcs in 1984, then the bloc in 1993, and randomly ndp in 2011. or quebec ending four decades' worth of liberal-pq dominance and giving an overwhelming majority to a new party. i could go on, but this kind of frequent ad widespread party-switching is exceptionally rare in fptp systems.

so i think much of the blue-orange phenomenon is explained simply by people not bearing any loyalty to a single party and switching depending on platform, leader, job approval, etc.

why are blue-orange voters more common out west? for one, the ndp/ccf started out in the west and got a head start in the western provinces, and challenged the liberals effectively. the modern liberal brand has become associated with cosmopolitan toronto/montreal interests, so when moderate tory voters get fed up with their party, they go to the ndp. the west also has more of a more blue-collar culture that is economically populist, socially moderate, and culturally conservative, unlike the gta which is economically moderate, but socially and culturally liberal. the latter fits perfectly into the liberal coalition, but the ndp resonates more with the former.",liberals

that stat doesn't really tell us much, since 44% of people in ontario live in the toronto cma. digging into a bit via the canadian geospatial geographical explorer, of the 2,262,505 property owners living in the toronto cma, 359,475 of them (the stat cited in the report you linked above) own multiple properties, which works out to about 16%. it's also important to note that many of those additional properties aren't rent-generating homes but are instead cottages, cabins, hunt camps, etc. 

i know it's anecdotal, but i grew up in york region (part of the toronto cma) and of all the people i knew, my family was one of the few who *didn't* have a cottage or cabin. none of them rented theirs out, and the properties were mostly in areas that are far from decent jobs - so their owning these properties isn't exactly keeping prime housing stock off the market. 

do we have solid data that tells us landlords and housing investors driving this? from what i can see, it mostly looks like too many people and too much cheap money chasing too few homes.

https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/housing-index

you can see here that from 2017-mid 2020, housing prices were essentially flat after a more or less constant rise since before 2000. given they were elected in 2015, and it takes time for their policies to take effect, i'm not gonna blame 2015-2016 on the liberals. that means, effectively, since they finally started working on it until a worldwide pandemic hit us, they were achieving some success. 

housing is *absolutely* an issue that needs to be the focus going forwards because young people like you and me are being priced out of the market, but the pandemic sorta hit us with a 30% increase in a single year, and housing was not a major focus of the 2019 campaign because the problem had been somewhat held in check.

if not for the pandemic, the liberals would be praised for having *some* (read some, not enough) progress on housing affordability, but the pandemic was like a thermonuclear bomb going off on the countries housing sector, as work from home enabled landed people in the city to sell their multimillion dollar homes and drive the price up everywhere else.

for what its worth, i really, really like the liberal housing platform for this election - housing is a multifaceted problem, and the liberal platform tries to tackle it on all fronts, starting with nymbyism. i don't think they're not trying, and i don't think its completely fair to look at the disaster - largely inflicted by the pandemic - and lay the blame squarely at their feet.

[https://9gag.com/gag/axgw8xd](https://9gag.com/gag/axgw8xd)

you have repeatedly, both in your responses here and in your angry little dm you sent me, jumped to the most insane interpretation of my comment to justify the prejudices you already hold. 

there are good policies in the liberal platform that i support. i like the daycare plan (though i also like aspects of the tory plan for families that have non standard child care scheduling needs). the long term care policy and funding are positive, and i like aspects of the housing plan. just as a few examples. 

however, **at the same time** they didn't need this election to do any of that stuff. it's not undemocratic of them to call one - but it is craven and self involved. given the way the polls are looking the tories might even win, and those policies would then never happen. 

essentially the liberals need to **justify** risking losing and thus having none of this stuff happening, **instead** of continuing to work with the ndp in the previous parliament. one can think they're craven and self involved while also liking their policies. the two aren't mutually exclusive.

my comment was exclusively focused on the former - and simply noted that while having a costed platform is an advantage, there is also the disadvantage that the only thing that might prevent these policies from actually happening is the fact that the liberals called the election in the first place.",liberals

i don’t know if the ndp will get any major concessions or even be able to defend the carbon tax or daycare in a cpc minority situation, and if the cpc win a majority we’re going to see a lot of gains lost even if otoole pretends to be a centrist. 

i just can’t in good faith want a cpc minority even over trudeau, when the cpc threatens to make us worse on the biggest existential threat of our lifetime, and, on paper, has a worse housing policy, and wants to trash what is in my opinion the best progressive policy that has been passed since the turn of the 21st century after legalization of gay marriage ( the policy being childcare).

i’d rather keep a weakened liberal minority where the liberal’s only dance partner is the ndp. maybe they will finally acquiesce to a true coalition and ndp members can take minister positions. childcare could go ahead as planned, we could tackle climate change, and singh could hold trudeau’s feet to the bloody fire all day long to make sure we went after housing.

she was excellent at both speaking to an audience and one-on-one. i remember going door-knocking with her in vancouver granville in the middle of the controversy over tax changes to private corporations. one guy, a successful realtor who had been a strong liberal supporter in 2015, was spitting mad over the changes. i was amazed at how she was able to defuse his anger, promising to get together with him and others unhappy about the changes to discuss it further.

i was of course torn when snc lavalin hit the news. in the end, after reading through all the transcripts, i felt like everyone sincerely believed they were doing the right thing, and wires got crossed. there was a lengthy period where jwr and jane philpott had resigned from cabinet but were still members of the liberal caucus, and i understand that there were a lot of efforts to try to resolve the dispute - this was all happening in an election year! - which failed in the end.

jwr won a narrow victory in 2019, and i was fully expecting her to run again in the upcoming election, so i'm surprised she isn't going to. i'm very interested in knowing what she'll decide to do next. a major challenge in bc is [negotiating first nations land claims](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/fr/magazines/aout-2016/an-unsung-success-the-first-nations-land-management-act/), so this would be an obvious issue for her to return to.",liberals
