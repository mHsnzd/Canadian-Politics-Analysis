gs8v7a3,2021-03-25T12:02:09.000-07:00,"supreme court rules that canada’s carbon price is constitutional &gt; although early canadian constitutional decisions by the judicial committee of the privy council applied a rigid division of federal-provincial powers as watertight compartments, the court has favoured a flexible view of federalism, best described as a modern cooperative federalism, that accommodates and encourages intergovernmental cooperative efforts. however, the court has also always maintained that flexibility and cooperation, while important, cannot override or modify federalism and the constitutional division of powers.

i’m happy with the outcome, but i’m unhappy with the procedure. some day my province (bc) will lose its ability to legislate its own carbon pricing because the liberals will deem it as unsatisfactory. ‘modern cooperative federalism’ is an affront to my rights as a canadian, it means a majority of people who live across the country from me can win an increasing amount of say in how my life is governed. i severely doubt this new federalism goes both ways, e.g. i don’t think provinces will ever win powers back from the federal government. 

we will see what happens, but this appears to be another domino in our long path toward a unitary country with only eastern voices making decisions.",liberals

so there were zero conservatives at the time that believed in modern science, or you're ok with a politician filling a role with an unqualified hack?  you should also know there is nothing requiring a minister to be an mp, so i'm not sure what you mean by \"must represent their riding and constituents.\"  would you promote a minister of agriculture that thinks plants literally eat soil and poop oxygen, or would you hope someone in that role was a little more knowledgeable about the field under them?

&gt;goodyear, the minister of state for science and technology, has presided over the most retrograde federal science and technology policy in memory. during his tenure, the government shuttered the office of the national science adviser, blocked asbestos from a un hazardous chemicals list on which it clearly belongs, gutted the fisheries act, gutted the navigable waters protection act, set out to weaken the species at risk act, killed the long-form census, eroded environment canada’s ability to monitor climate change, earned an international reputation for muzzling scientists and, at a great potential cost, defunded the world’s leading freshwater research centre... at the same time, changes to our science-funding regime and a makeover of the national research council, canada’s science agency, into a tool box for industry have dented our basic-research infrastructure and damaged our prospects for innovation.

my own thinking is this: if the socons were capable of outreach to social conservatives of other faiths they could be a very powerful force. we dismiss this as we have just seen the movement across north america double down on white protestant identity politics for some time. we should remember that jason kenney did just such a thing for harper in the late 00’s with noteworthy success. it’s a possibility we ignore at our peril, but with recency bias we might not even notice the change for a while if they made one.",conservatives

i recognize that many of the harms inflicted by many illicit drugs are because they are illegal. and also, that they are stigmatized, illicit, and isolated, means that you will see more selection bias with those who use it. take a country where almost everyone uses alcohol who is roughly 15 years old or older, perhaps a very catholic country, and you will see very little selection bias, and so our conception that alcohol only sometimes leads to problem drinking is tied to how most people are not afflicted with the already existing problems that motivate dangerous drug use like certain psychological problems, trauma, gangster activity, among others. others like cocaine, as we see so few people use it, and those few aren't a random sample of the adult population, we can imagine that most people who aren't either looking for a very particular thrill, have a very particular curiosity, or have those pre existing reasons, wouldn't use cocaine to begin with and you'd have to bribe them quite a lot to get them to do it, even if only for the purpose of scientific research about what percentage of people would naturally get addicted to cocaine in the first place, other other drugs for that matter. 

still, there are significant acute risks of cocaine, and in a society where we already have quite a few cardiovascular problems with our other habits, having a stroke or heart attack or screwing with your other circulatory systems is going to be a bigger problem than if we tried this experiment in japan perhaps. 

pretty much the only idea i would have for figuring out how to get a random representative sample to do this is for coca cola to re-add the coke to their other coke, and that would violate medical ethics.",liberals

for 25-34 you're about 59% turnout in 2019. for 35-44 you're at \\~65%. both age groups represent millennials as part of the ones seeking home ownership. in terms of indifference, statistically it has always been the younger generations that have lower voter turnout. this isn't particularly new and can be attributed to many different factors, not just people not wanting to vote. [you can find data on voting blocs by age here.](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/eval/pes2019/vtsa/infgr&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e)

millennials represent one of the largest, if not largest voting blocs in the country. [according to abacusdata](https://abacusdata.ca/the-rising-political-power-of-millennials/) we currently have more voting power than the boomer generation. i suspect in the next few elections we're going to see a lot more voter involvement from millennials, as is typical when you look at voting by age statistics. the longer housing continues to be a key issue, the more people will vote in favour of policies and parties that can address this. 

so, in short. the election could absolutely be fought and won on housing if enough of both the millennial and gen z voters are pushed into voting it as a single issue. we can't discount this because we've seen that other countries (the u.s. circa 08') fought and campaigned on the youth vote and probably won out in large part because of it. trudeau and the lpc in 2015 also fought on this premise and saw an uptick in the general election from it as well.",liberals

yeah the two seats that they gained last time (moncton east &amp; moncton south) are \"toss up\" seats. it's what made the pc majority last time and it could determine their minority status next time.

so how would you suggest changing the relationship canadians have with housing? the article mentions capital gains taxes on primary residences. i personally feel this would be a great move to curb the idea that housing is an investment.

while i definitely am solidly on the left politically i have to agree with the supply argument.  this is the real crux of the problem. the reason that vancouver and gta went so high has that there was no more space for housing. these areas are boxed in by land features, parks and agriculture.  with fast growing populations we were not building enough housing to keep up with that demand.

there is another factor - demand - that affects prices but that is much harder to control. the reality is if you have vacancy rates 2% or lower, you are going to likely see rental rates rise. these areas had under 1% vacancy for so long that prices were bound to go up. the real question is, why did everyone put up with it? i mean there is plenty of affordable housing outside of bc and the gta. now that more companies are allowing people to work from home i think we will see population spread more evenly over the country. i really do hope that people will see that if there is a cheaper option in canada, that may be a better option. now regina’s rentals will likely never be higher than vancouver’s, but we could see all rentals across canada be within 50% of each other. this is a real issue: the immobility of the population. change that and we can start to have things even out.

on the supply side, even though we have been building lots in canada, it is still not keeping up with our population growth. in order to have prices fall, we need to have an excess supply of housing. i agree with you that developers have been focusing on more high end properties, but that really shouldn’t matter as much as there is still a lot of older stock of homes and in reality, this may be the only way they can build and make a profit. what we could do is allocate funds to projects that will have the right type of housing that we need (e.g. 3 bedroom apartments). 

i also agree that affordable housing spending is not going to work. with our population set to grow about 1%/year (370k) there is no way that we could keep up with that demand trying to build affordable housing. we need to find a way to lower the costs of housing for all canadians so that everyone can have affordable housing.",liberals

i agree.  but that's not what the cpc has offered up till now.

heck, i am not a fan of tax credits/rebates for evs, but i can even appreciate some of the infrastructure proposals that biden is putting forward to get emissions cut.  we could do with better intercity rail (like via's hfr proposal) and grid interconnects (like the atlantic loop).  done as part of a broader package, those could deliver meaningful reductions in emissions.  but again, i haven't seen much appetite for that kind of proposal either.  heck, i haven't seen one peep from a single cpc mp on via hfr.  despite the proposal impacting several cpc held or flippable ridings.  

so the conclusion then ends up being that the party's approach is basically, \"we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas.\"

well.. yes and no. they've taken climate more seriously than the libs in fact if not on paper. mulroney wasn't cpc, but he was conservative and he did wipe out acid rain and had broad support for it in the party. emissions did fairly well under harper, although we might give at least as much credit to the economic recession, and he did do much with his home improvement tax. 

the libs did literally nothing. 

but i will concede that the cpc has to put forward an actual plan and more importantly actual targets. 

&gt;so the conclusion then ends up being that the party's approach is basically, \"we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas.\"

vs the liberal conclusion that ends up being \"we've tried nothing, but we're prepared to lie to you about what we're going to try as long as you're stupid enough to keep falling for it\". 

the fact is the cpc did actually do a few things, but they don't present 'plans' - they just do a few things. well - thats still better than the libs but it's absolutely not enough. where as the libs say they'll do lots of things but do nothing. 

i would also put forward that if both sides lack a plan currently, then where your focus should be is on the financial health of the nation. any plan is going to cost money one way or another. if we don't have the resources to make that happen then you can forget everything. we won't fight climate change nor will we adapt. 

so you should be looking at which party is likely to leave the country's economy and finances in the best shape so that when someone does decide to take action, it's something that can actually happen. at the same time pressure all parties to take action. 

the libs have borrowed more money in the last 7 years than we did in the 150 before it. and they're looking at ramping that up. the carbon tax will put a drag on the economy at the levels he's pushing it to, you'd have to be blind not to see that. trudeau was badly mismanaging the economy before the crisis, and he's not doing any better now. taxes are going to have to go up - there's really no stopping that now, and the more he jacks them the slower the economy will be. there will be a 'spurt' when the country reopens - but then it's going to be tough times. 

and as we've seen - when times get tough climate change goes right out the window. 

&gt;now, what are you thoughts on the eu emissions trading scheme and their performance on emissions reductions?

lol - ahhh, so you want to move on to another simple and light topic i see.  :)  i think i'm a little 'climate change fatigued' to open that discussion at the moment :) 

not to be a downer but honestly i don't think any of this is going to matter. the gov'ts won't \"do\" anything substantial globally and change will only occur when technology evolves to the point where it's actually easier to use low emission tech than not, and you can't create that artificially. in the meantime the earth will heat up as much as it's going to heat up and all we'll be able to do is adapt and survive as best we can and hope that the low end of the models is what happens instead of the high end. 

meanwhile people will vote for the parties that tell the sweetest lies around the world and nothing will happen. greta will distract everyone from the real issues nicely and someone else will be found now that she's getting boring. 

and i fear that the next decade is going to face some severe financial challenges. interest rates will start to go up and with the money we just borrowed federally and provincially that's going to put a severe squeeze on the gov't books.

gt1gf2e,2021-04-01T01:27:48.000-07:00,"editorial: carbon tax not as popular as liberals think &gt;like i said earlier, i'm open to alternative ideas. 

i'm sure you are. and i woudln't want this to sound like i'm critical of you personally or as a person. but it's really getting too late in the game to be 'open to new ideas'. this is the point where we should be discarding ideas that don't work and getting serious. you can play with the numbers all you want, at the end of the day if we take the results from actual experience and we compare them to what we predicted and what we actually need. and the results are far far lower than we predicted and no where near what we need. unless you increase the tax to the point where it damages the economy, and at that point it's really not the carbon tax that's \"working\", it's that lower economic activity tends to drive down energy use, just like we see in a recession or the like. put the country into \"lockdown\" and you lower emissions - but that has severe negative repercussions over time. 

&gt;i'll offer you one last point to ponder. british columbians and quebecers never voted out their carbon tax.

true... and not quite. the did in fact have enough political force to slow it whenever it climbed too fast for the economic conditions, and there was a great deal of pressure when the pandemic started to quash it. at least in bc. but then gas prices fell world wide and the pressure went away. 

so - in other words - as long as the tax is low enough that people don't really feel it or notice it - then they won't take action against it. and that's what happened, the carbon tax was first introduced in bc for example right before the recession hit (bad luck really, it skews the data we could have collected about it). so - suddenly gas prices and energy prices go down and they slow down the implementation of the tax, and companies like logging etc are using less gas because there's no work anyway so it's not impacting jobs or the economy. 

but as we also have discussed - it didn't work. emissions shot right back up the moment the recession was over and climbed at a high rate. 

whenever gas prices have gotten higher, especially when they've done so during harder economic times (such as the beginning of the pandemic) then there's kick back. in fact we saw this in bc just before the pandemic. if the pandemic hadn't driven gas prices down, we could have had a revolt in that regard:

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-bc-premier-john-horgan-says-government-is-seeking-ways-to-provide/

so yes - when the tax is low enough that it has no impact at all, people don't care about it. when it impacts them, they start to care and pressure mounts. but - the tax needs to have an impact in order to work. which is why it didn't work. so - if it has enough impact to work, people won't stand for it. when it doesn't, they don't care. 

about all we can take away from this is that people and the economy can tolerate a small tax provided gas prices are low enough. and maybe we can use that money to do things that actually help the environment. but - that's not what a 'carbon tax' is and carbon taxes don't work.",liberals

it's pretty clear that since harper the conservative base has been gaining more influence within the party. now the party still has levers to pull (the \"alleged\" backroom dealings that blocked bernier come to mind), but they're weaker. it's harder to clear the path for establishment picks like mackay and candidates now have to contend with insurgents like leslyn lewis and derick sloan who will appeal directly to socon base. a stronger, more centralized, cpc wouldn't be dealing with a maverick party right now.

not true, look at the latest premier polling by agnus reed (june 9th).  they literally have a section called: saskatchewan party dominates, it includes a provincial poll.  sask party is polling at 57% which is an easy win.

beyond these top line numbers, there's also some fairly interesting things in this poll. last week's ekos poll attempted to determine political support among minorities, and here we see abacus doing something very similar-- although perhaps wisely abacus approaches the question as just 'visible' minorities rather than trying to break down specific groups like indigenous (i can understand, even support the drive to do so on the part of ekos, but the sample sizes for each were comically small). as before, we see the lpc with a very large lead in this area, even over the ndp.",conservatives

“independence” is another way of saying that they do not answer to the will of the people. it’s long overdue that the senate be abolished. it’s extremely undemocratic that an unelected body with virtually no conditions for appointment can literally kill democratically passed legislation. it exists solely to put a check on the power of the people - to limit democracy. “sober second thought” is such a condescending phrase. so the people are drunk and incapable to deciding for themselves? i have no respect for the institution nor the title of senator. they are just a modern aristocracy.",liberals

perhaps you misunderstood. the consensus was er (using the formula to best determine the type). the agreement to a referendum was just what got the cpc members of the committee to join the consensus. it wasn't \"just a referendum\".

&gt; here you are blaming the lpc for abandoning er while also praising the ndp where the best they could do was get a referendum... despite saying the liberals were elected -- given a mandate -- solely on er.

this absolutely is a divisive issue and anyone who pays attention to whats going on is aware its intentional. trudeau straight up lied in the house of commons to gain support for this law. he said \"gun owners didn't have to show their license to buy a gun, they weren't bound by law\" which is utterly false and frankly hurt to hear the pm make a bold face lie like that to canadians about gun owners and the law that we take so seriously. c71 is not \"perfectly reasonable\". its also an attempt at a back door long gun registry. the actual long gun registry failed miserably, didn't solve a single crime and it cost tax payers upwards of 2 billion dollars, they want this because it ties guns to people and makes it possible for them to lay charges against canadians who bought a firearm legally to then have it prohibited by the rcmp or through oic if they refuse to hand them in, or simply didn't know the law had change (which is a major issue with the frt system, only gun dealers and law enforcement have access to the frt, simply put theres little to no way average canadians can know their firearms have been prohibited by the rcmp)

&gt;many canadians are regularly insulted by gun enthusiasts as being sheep or too stupid to understand what an assault rifle is

i'm in the boards all the time and i have never seen a gun owner call someone \"sheep\". we are correct however in calling out peoples ignorance in regards to firearm law and particularly firearm definitions because this sort of misinformation leads directly to bans on firearms that are least likely to be used in homicides statisticly.

&gt;you complain that this is about some “schadenfrude towards the rural conservative other”

i can't really point to a specific policy or action that could ostensibly explain such a dip in the polls beyond just calling the election itself. would that be enough on its own to prompt so many to change their vote? the only other thing i can think of is that those pre-election polls were inaccurate and there had always been widespread discontent with trudeau and the liberals but i don't see the why or how for that either when you look at their past two years in government and the 2019 result. the idea that this is or should be a change election just doesn't make sense to me. people really think that now is the time for a cpc government, when we're just beginning to pull ourselves out of this pandemic and when action on climate change is becoming more and more urgent? or have people stopped caring about these issues?

the only formal federal coalition government in canadian history was the union government of robert borden, which isn't even typical for coalitions since borden brought in liberals who supported conscription, while many liberal mps remained out of the coalition. so this might be considered more of temporary floor crossing by a bloc of liberal mps.

the last time a coalition was proposed at the federal level was in 2008 just a few months after the election, when the opposition parties announced they would defeat the tories in a confidence vote, and then the liberals and ndp would form a coalition government, with a confidence and supply agreement with the bloc quebecois (a sort of hybrid coalition). of course, harper got the best of them by asking the governor general to prorogue parliament before any confidence vote could be held.

there are have been coalitions at the provincial level, the most recent being the confidence and supply agreement between the bc ndp and the bc green party, whereby the three green mlas agreed to support the ndp minority government on all confidence votes and motions. so it does happen, but even in provincial politics, it's not a common occurence.",liberals

his current goal seems to be more of advising leaders to adopt a plan to get to net zero by 2050; and realistically the only way to do that is through electoral reform. so, if we implement ranked choice voting, climate change policy will be passed no matter what party is in charge. 

if we don't act on climate change in the next 4 years, we will have to cut carbon emissions 50% every year until 2050 to get to net zero. if we don't act on climate change in the next 8 years, it will be impossible to act on climate change and human civilization will collapse; but if we act on it now, we have to cut carbon emissions 30% every 10 years to get to net zero by 2050.

i'll start by debunking your ridiculous claim that we were at an \"all-time high\" level of spending. this is false and shows you have done no research at all. maybe you've never heard that our deficits have been modest because you've been gullible enough to fall for conservative propaganda for 5 years rather than actually look up data, because you clearly haven't.

[here's an article comparing the liberals deficits to past deficits.](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/03/23/canada-budget-deficit-comparison_n_9532294.html) as you can see, we are not at an \"all time high\" with spending. nowhere even close.

[here's proof of my debt to gdp claim.](https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/government-debt-to-gdp)

 [your foreign debt ownership claim is also over-exaggerated.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canadian_public_debt#foreign_ownership) turns out our foreign debt ownership is also low compared to other developed countries. [also, china owes canada nearly half a million in debt.](https://ipolitics.ca/2021/01/04/china-still-owes-canada-371-million-in-decades-old-debt/) so even if we owe them, they owe us too. i also did some research and found that there is no data on how much we owe china, so you literally just made that claim up. your credibility at this point isn't very strong.

and finally as a last, desperate, pathetic resort you call canada's budget \"woke\". i don't even know what to say to that. as for the rest of your claims, they are irrelevant because we're only discussing budgets. i've acknowledged trudeau has many flaws, but budgets are not one of them.",liberals

fun fact that not many know, dividends are “taxed at a lower rate” than earned income. cool, huh? except they are “grossed up” for the purposes of tax reporting.

so if you take say $50k in dividends, you have to report it as something like $64k for tax purposes.

rent will rise to match it.with the increase in energy prices due to the elimination of cheap polluting fuels like coal,

the increase in food prices due to lack of  workers on farms and in other low-wage jobs

the increase in product prices due to supply demand and increase in raw material costs and transportation, as well as shipping delays.

and suddenly you're looking at stagflation where the economy can only operate under life-support... continuous quantitative easing and stimulus injections.

all of these parties should be banning speculators in the housing market (vacant properties), whether they're canadian or not. airbnb and other commercial services should be immediately constrained to commercial zones or be taxed like a fucking resort renting the most pristine land in the world even if they're located on a dump.

once you remove real estate and rent related inflation, other areas inflation like food and retail become temporary (except for energy that is.. that will get more expensive for the foreseeable future).

hcpwkqr,2021-09-13T04:11:51.000-07:00,"i fact-checked everything liberal leader justin trudeau said for a week. here’s what i found so the title (header?) in the article is \"in one week, liberal leader justin trudeau made 5 false claims\". the paywall came up before i got the deets but i used some voodoo to slip past it and got what i think are the 5 false claims, according to the author:

&gt; when questioned in the french debate on his failure to lift all boil water advisories in first nations communities by 2021 — as he promised in 2015 — he blamed the pandemic for the delay, when in reality the liberals were never on track to meet their deadline.


&gt; another example came speaking with reporters in montreal, when trudeau said his government had “moved forward concretely on a national universal pharmacare deal with prince edward island.” national universal pharmacare was one of the liberals’ central campaign promises last election, but the government has ultimately made little progress. the p.e.i. deal, signed last month, is neither national (obviously) nor universal, since although it lowers drug costs for people already covered by the public plan, it doesn’t expand to people who aren’t covered. so it was misleading to describe the deal in these terms.


&gt; [r]esponding to singh’s claim that the government is “taking indigenous kids to court,” trudeau was the one being misleading. the government is, in fact, challenging in federal court a decision by the canadian human rights tribunal that requires ottawa to pay compensation to indigenous children who ended up in foster care as a result of systemically underfunded health care. 


&gt; in [another], in response to a charge by o’toole that the liberals are going to tax primary home sales, trudeau was correct. the liberals are proposing a tax on people profiting from flipping homes; very few primary residences are affected, so it’s wrong to frame the plan that way.
 

&gt; at least one false claim — that canada has evacuated “a lot” more people from afghanistan than our european allies (the u.k. has evacuated more than 15,000; canada 3,700) — seemed like an impromptu slip-up.

and to wrap it all off, the author gives some stats!

&gt; that works out to a “dishonesty density” of about one false claim every 50 minutes, with every repeated falsehood counting once for each time it was said. for reference, o’toole’s dishonesty density was one false claim every 30 minutes, singh’s was one every 46 minutes, and paul’s was one every 47 minutes.

now my opinion on these:

1) i don't know too much, but the current liberals have made progress on this. it just doesn't seem like much since their water systems are failing at an alarming rate. [101 advisories were active nov 2015, 101 resolved by mar 10th, 2021, 58 added](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-new-website-term-drinking-water-advisories-1.5943388). i get why the author would mark that as a false claim, since mr. trudeau objectively hasn't resolved *all* water advisories, but they're not far off the mark. 

2) yes. this seems like mislabeling the pei pharma-care plan as a universal national pharma-care plan. exact quote of the statement is missing though, so maybe there's more context (?).

3) i don't know enough about this situation.

4) i'm confused why this statement seems to be a false claim (maybe my voodoo isn't perfect yet). this seems like the author is complaining that its a \"house-flipping\" tax, not a \"primary residence sales tax\"?

5) i can't find good up to date numbers on how many are evacuated. seems like the number is changing often.",liberals

so layton died about a year before trudeau put his name forward as lpc leader. ignatieff resigned right after the 2011 election, but the party went on a super-protracted leadership process, hoping the process itself would rejuvenate the party. so the sentence as you've worded it is a mix of the facts and of my speculation. layton died a long time before trudeau started to muse aloud about leadership, so he never actually said \"if layton's still leading the ndp, i won't run\". his reluctance was based on... i'm not sure what, but i think he was worried whether he could be seen as serious enough (his main act of significance at that point was calling peter kent an asshole in the hoc) and also it was a real stretch at the time to imagine the lpc could get back on their feet within 10 years. he might have viewed leadership as a poisoned chalice.

in any case, trudeau launched his leadership campaign with a self-recorded video on social media. he was working hard on the 'hip with the youth' angle. as you say, layton already had that angle, but he also had respect from other age groups as well. with all due respect to trudeau's supporters here, i think layton would have wiped the floor with trudeau.",liberals

i agree white collar crime should be punished more severely. granting meng the same leeway granted to other criminals of her class would be simply another example of a powerful person escaping punishment due to their connections. the answer is to attempt to pass more stringent laws around white collar crime, perhaps to add a provision compelling prosecution in certain cases, a sort of minimum sentencing guideline.

we're two years into what was supposed to be an eight year liberal plan to create pharmacare, and there seems to have been one discussion with the provinces where nothing remotely specific was discussed.

the original deadline to start covering some essential medications was january 1, 2022 -- 10 months from now. something has to happen to get things moving.

if the federal government doesn't show up with a proposal, which the provinces can either like or object to specific parts of, there will never be substantive discussions.

if this government seemed willing to put together such a proposal, without legislation, that would be the best path forward imo. but, after 2 years of inaction, it seems reasonable for opposition parties to step in using the tools at their disposal -- that means putting a proposal in legislation.

it's not ideal, but it's a heck of a lot better than the nothing burger we're getting from the liberals. and the suggestions that it was either unconstitutional or unilaterally enforced anything on the provinces is simply not true.",liberals

governments need to be able to do more than one thing at a time. if they really couldn't find the time to put together a proposal for the provinces for how pharmacare worked... well, the ndp just did it for them. they could have voted yes.
