i voted for pm trudeau in his first election and i was really hopeful for electoral reform, as i continue to be disappointed by canada's election system. 

this is another example of where pm trudeau says one thing and does something completely different. he is canada's prime minister, he had duties to execute on a day of reconciliation that his government instituted.

you're mistaken that failing a confidence vote after an election leads to another election immediately. that's simply not true. after an election that leads to a hung legislature (or what wilfully ignorant media organisations insist on calling \"minority governments\", before such a government is formed) there is well established procedure for prospective governments to test the confidence of the legislature.

the most recent example happened in bc two elections ago. no party won a majority of seats. 

clark was the incumbent premier. she reconvened the legislature and attempted to win a confidence vote. she failed. 

the lg then asked horgan to form a government and test the confidence of the legislature. he succeeded, with the help of the greens and a liberal agreeing to be speaker. he was then able to govern normally.

there would be no need to immediately return to the polls, unless all three major parties insist on it by refusing to support any other party in forming government - a scenario so bizarre as to be politically inconceivable with our current array of parties and leaders.",liberals

here's an article for you:

https://policymagazine.ca/brian-mulroney-is-having-a-moment/

 *through a combination of reduced program spending, new taxes, and*   
*privatizations, he succeeded in steering canada away from a fiscal*   
*cliff. when he took office in 1984, the non-interest deficit was $12*   
*billion. when he left in 1993, it was in surplus.*

so he inherited a brutal non interest deficit, and turned it around fairly quickly and was pretty much break even for most of his terms and pulled it into surplus before the end. 

but - he couldn't pay that interest. 

and it was not paul martin's budget that was the turning point. it was the creation of the gst, and more importantly the free trade deal everyone claimed to hate and that chrietien said he'd scrap along with the gst. our trade surplus with the states rose ten fold. that is massive. 

adding to that was the falling interest rates that came with a stable economy he helped create. it's impossible to pay the interest at 21 percent - its a little easier at 5 percent. its literally tens of billions of dollars per year different. 

sorry - but you are just 100 percent cast iron wrong. if you're talking structural - as you said - mulroney did not run deficits overall and if you're taking about the recovery he did the lions' share - which chretian ran against and then kept because it worked.",liberals

that much is absolutely true - more specifically since justin took over. even martin was no where near as left as justin was. 

but that doesn't make the ppc centrist. it just makes the liberals leftists. 

as a center right person the ppc's  policies are very ideologically based and too far to the 'right'.  or more accurately they're very extreme versions of common right wing thinking. balance the budget in 2 years while lowering taxes? do you have any idea how much cutting that would require and what that would do to the economy? every conservative would agree with balancing the budget but that was insanely radical (pre covid of course, i'm not talking about now when it wouldn't be possible no matter what). 

their immigration is based more on cutting numbers than logically considering canada's needs and useful changes to the point system. 

human climate change denial is hardly moderate either. 

sorry but they're certainly not center-right and frankly they're mostly on the far right side of 'right'. bordering on actually being far right. and i don't mean the 'evil far right' that the left likes to claim but the extreme of conservative ideas bordering on social conservative ideas.",liberals

(btw i'm only arguing that trudeau *can* advise gg simon to dissolve parliament, and if he does then she has to do it; not that he *should*. it's definitely legal, and what singh is suggesting the gg to do is out of line. if you want to argue that it's not the right thing to do and trudeau should focus on governing, or that our laws shouldn't allow it, then fair enough).",liberals

in canada, at least for the last 40 years, we tend to keep federal governments in power until we're damn well good and sick of them.  the average life expectancy of a governing party is roughly ten years, give or take a snap election or two.  for whatever reason, we keep them governing until they have absolutely no excuses left as to why they've failed to deliver on all those promises they made, then we change it up and elect the other party for a while.  rinse and repeat, and congratulations to the ndp for really trying so hard.

lewis as those ministers might be good. she's a self-described social conservative but not enough to piss off non-conservatives too much. social development sounds good considering she was given an award for \"professional excellence\" by the black business association.

scheer for agriculture sounds good on paper but it seems like he wants to be left alone and get retired without anymore scandals.

chong is personally my favourite cpc mp but he was holding a bunch of random positions under harper so he could be basically anything, currently critic for foreign affairs because he's from hong kong and the cpc foreign affairs strategy (in opposition) is mainly \"china bad.\"

just thought of one, that duncan guy can be equality minister since he's gay and has had experience in the fighting for equality thing, and while obviously women and lgbtq are very different minorities, it seems like something eo would do to get a balance and who knows, maybe by the next parliament the social justice ministries will be different entirely.

maybe. i think it's more difficult for bc ndp politicians to jump to the federal liberals because the ndp is an integrated party - anyone who's a member of the bc ndp is also a member of the federal ndp, and the bc ndp helps out the federal ndp in federal elections, so a bc ndp politician moving to the federal liberals would be seen as something of a betrayal.

quick edit: fptp systems tend to encourage 2 big tent parties that exchange power, 1 or 2 others that are too small/fringe to gain power, and regional parties. (check this against present canadian, us, and uk politics.) pr tends to produce many more parties with narrower, more specific interests than operate in coalitions. pr in canada would result in the three main big tent parties splitting into factions, so that the labour and green arms of the ndp, for example, would go their separate ways and reduce intraparty compromise, but increase interparty dealmaking.",liberals

hdcy0zb,2021-09-18T04:11:37.000-07:00,"trudeau says he remains open to electoral reform if the liberals are re-elected sure.

so ranked ballot in its simplest form is just, you rank your favourites 1-whatever, though you can choose not to rank parties. then every time a candidate is last, they take people who selected them as 1st choice and redistribute them to those people's second choice. and so and so forth until you get a winner. of course problem being you might hate your listed 4th, 3rd or even 2nd choice that ends up winning. which leads to people just not ranking other parties, or parties people hate getting their vote.

whereas with stv you get a single transferable vote that elects multiple winners in a district. with a preferred preference and back-up choices. it eliminates candidates until you have the same number of candidates as are alotted to that district or until you've elected the max number of people. now those surplus votes can also be awarded proportionately, the larger the district, the more proportional realignment there is. overall you end up with a result that closely approximates a proportional vote. a benefit is that it can get voters to look more at individual candidates, however with the way our westminster system works candidates for parties have to tow to the party line to pass confidence votes and budgets. so imo mmpr is a better option",liberals

so, this is a lie. an outright lie. about 90% of respondents had agreed and wanted proportional representation. the **all-party committee** suggested a referendum on pr. what threshold does he think he is going to get above 90% and all the parties agreeing?

besides the obvious contempt we should feel over his recycling of a promise he famously broke when he couldn't get his way, he also has the audacity to say he wants ranked ballots (again), which no one wanted, and which would make the system **more unfair**.

when the centre party is small, there *could be* a \"centre squeeze\" phenomenon, but when the centre party is strong, they become most people's choice further down the ballot. ranked ballots would give us liberal majorities for the rest of time. a one-party state, effectively.

accusations that it favors the liberals is just static analysis. yes, if the parties don't change their positions, it benefits the liberals. political parties do react to electoral incentives. if ranked ballots do get adopted, we'll see parties shift their platforms to appeal to the median voters more aggressively. it'll lead to *policies* the median liberal voter might prefer but it shouldn't favor the liberal party in the long term.",liberals

in terms of general availability, time-zones are a thing, and none of us want to wait 3\\~6 hours for our outsourced execution teams to wake up. our clients are in north america, so we need to execute and communicate during north american working hours. we can't outsource things that our north american clients need while they're awake. it's bad enough that us in toronto need to wait til noon for our vancouver office to wake up, it kills half our day.

and as far as operational fluidity goes, outsourced work also tends to come with a high turnover and a loss of personability. it's challenging to constantly have to ramp up new outsourced coworkers on what they need to execute, only for them to be replaced the following month, and to feel like you're just one of many teams your outsourced resources support. many clients expect you to be a 'partner' and that isn't often feasible when you don't have dedicated coworkers on the operational end.

anyway, that's a bit of a ramble but i've worked in the digital field for 10+ years and i'm currently a director for a multinational agency now and those are two big hurdles we've yet to be able to clear when trying to make outsourced resources work in any practical sense.

the math that reform + pc = perpetual majority (based on how they polled at the time of the \"merger\"), just never worked out. almost immediately, support by moderates started to drop. the gain in support from the hard right, where few voters are, was more than offset by the loss of support from moderates, where the bulk of voters are.",conservatives

there is a clash here with the natural sciences and practical economics. if sea-side properties are going to be underwater then their value should depreciate greatly, but they're not, they're rapidly increasing. zero sense.

no, security is there to make sure that if there's a threat he gets away. it's not there to hold back an angry mob.

well they absolutely did, but i guess it depends on what you define as 'near'. seeing as you're the expert apperently - how close was the closest person?  and how close were they to his security?

unprepared? so ... what are you thinking, riot troops on the flanks and snipers here and here....  

you shouldn't have to prepare for that kind of thing. that's kind of the whole point. but it does sound like your're admitting this was more than just some people yelling at him from a distance.

oh it can be as loud and vehement as it wants to be. and it can be in as many camera shots as it likes.  but if you're physically in the face of the prime minster screaming and pushing at his security in a violent manner - that's over the line. 

you know i'm right. you're just being a complete leftie about it. pretending that reality isn't real and pretending you wouldn't complain if it were erin who was treated that way, or whatever leader you like. 

it's wrong and you know it. that's why you try to down play it by claiming it was just angry people saying mean things, rather than an angry mob pushing up against his security.  here's a hint - if you find you have to lie to make your point - you probably don't have a very good point.",liberals

to be clear, i'm not saying canada should or shouldn't participate as a global manufacturer of ev batteries. but we should own the ip. think magna as a tier 1 auto supplier.   canada wants to assemble battery packs for the global market for tesla, panasonic, lg for ev demand. but this isn't our ip. its just the assembly work. the government doesn't want to promote assembly of brake discs or chassis assembly, lots of those jobs available for non evs but because it's not sexy and green who cares....  its not about jobs, but the \"image\" of those jobs projects. recall none of these battery plants are even built or retooled, just announced mostly in ontario.

secondly, the us federal tax credit is $7,500 which already exists for evs for the first 200,000 units a manufacturer sells and proposed $5,000 for evs manufactured in the us and by union labor to both develop and promote the growth of the ev industry in america. this is a great thing. america is the leader in lithium battery chemistry. ev sales and will create more ev product more efficiently.  all canada is trying to provide is cheap subsidies, already announced for oems to keep low skill assembly jobs to say canada is green and innovative and now wants the attractive us subsidy with american tax dollars to apply to canada, effectively subsidizing canadian workers to develop a canadian ev industry with us tax dollars. 

canada is acting like a spoiled brat, first not inventing the product and ip or assembly process and now demanding a product destined for export be made here....

again... having tested evs significantly, why doesn't canada use our raw resources and develop a safer, larger density lithium chemistry say using a silicon anode for evs. have the whole supply chain in canada and a product the world wants. own the ip, supply chain, manufacturing... let's stop trying to feed off of other nations ip to keep some low skill jobs. it can be done.

&gt;they only said \"intimidate\", and talked and went away --

&gt;their sin it was that fed the fire -- small blame to them that heard --  
&gt;  
&gt;the \"bhoys\" get drunk on rhetoric, and madden at a word --  
&gt;  
&gt;they knew whom they were talking at, if they were irish too,  
&gt;  
&gt;the gentlemen that lied in court, they knew, and well they knew.  
&gt;

&gt;  
&gt;old as the ten commandments -- have ye talked those laws away?

i think this province still has a strong appetite for the old pc style center-right governance, which is why i think if ucp finds a somewhat moderate replacement for kenney that shows competence, the situation could still be salvaged. though i highly doubt they'd replace kenney with someone closer to the center.",conservatives

so i guess the idea is this: on the one hand, that is a political calculation on their part, but on the other hand it is a good example of the fact that we can't simply vote for policies to just *happen*, we must elect leaders to *implement* the policies we want.

in a representative democracy, majority support must be achieved for *leaders* to be elected on an entire *programme* of governance, and proportional representation makes it much more difficult to provide a majority mandate.

therefore, even if individual policies are popular (like electoral reform), it doesn't do us much good if we cannot elect stable governments capable of making tough decisions to move society forward.",liberals

north america for reasons that aren't entirely clear is extremely incompetent at building public transit. compared to europe and asia it takes far longer and costs far more. as a result much less it built. look at the disaster of the eglinton line 5. it's awfully hard to build density if you can't build the infrastructure it requires.

all to say, i would love to abolish single family zoning and implement a massive public transit build. personally i think  building 413 in addition to that is a good idea given how insane housing prices have gotten in the gtha. but doing nothing , or almost nothing, is just going to have housing prices double again over the next ten years. that's the trajectory we're currently on, the feds claim there's nothing they can do and then provinces/munis refuse to anger homeowners.",liberals

if i *had* posted something advocating genocide or promoting hatred against an identifiable group, and you reported it, and reddit refused to take it down, and you reported it to the commissioner, and the commissioner investigated and found it should have been taken down - then the commissioner could issue an order to reddit to take it down.
